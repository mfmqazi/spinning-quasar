so effectively so you can get exposed to effectively so you can get exposed to effectively so you can get exposed to living near these incinerators and living near these incinerators and living near these incinerators and breathing it but it'll take you 14 years breathing it but it'll take you 14 years breathing it but it'll take you 14 years to breathe in as much dioxin as a cow to breathe in as much dioxin as a cow to breathe in as much dioxin as a cow will ingest by eating the grass in one will ingest by eating the grass in one will ingest by eating the grass in one day and that dioxin will accumulate in day and that dioxin will accumulate in day and that dioxin will accumulate in his fat which includes the milk and the his fat which includes the milk and the his fat which includes the milk and the meat and anyone eating meat or dairy meat and anyone eating meat or dairy meat and anyone eating meat or dairy products is going to get that dose of products is going to get that dose of products is going to get that dose of dioxin so it climbs up the food chain dioxin so it climbs up the food chain dioxin so it climbs up the food chain every step men have no way in their every step men have no way in their every step men have no way in their bodies to get rid of dioxins but women bodies to get rid of dioxins but women bodies to get rid of dioxins but women have two ways they're both involving have two ways they're both involving have two ways they're both involving having a baby one is that dioxin crosses having a baby one is that dioxin crosses having a baby one is that dioxin crosses the placenta into the growing infant and the placenta into the growing infant and the placenta into the growing infant and the other is that it comes out from the the other is that it comes out from the the other is that it comes out from the breast milk so if you have a meat and breast milk so if you have a meat and breast milk so if you have a meat and dairy consuming mother breastfeeding dairy consuming mother breastfeeding dairy consuming mother breastfeeding that infant then the highest impacts of that infant then the highest impacts of that infant then the highest impacts of toxic exposure sure like Mercury and toxic exposure sure like Mercury and toxic exposure sure like Mercury and dioxins will go to that infant pregnant dioxins will go to that infant pregnant dioxins will go to that infant pregnant women are told oh certain types of fish women are told oh certain types of fish women are told oh certain types of fish should be avoided but what

have zero protection drink the most milk have zero protection milk does not build strong bones Harvard milk does not build strong bones Harvard milk does not build strong bones Harvard research have looked at a large group of research have looked at a large group of research have looked at a large group of older women over an 18-year period the older women over an 18-year period the older women over an 18-year period the milk drinkers had zero protection from milk drinkers had zero protection from milk drinkers had zero protection from fractures so this old notion that fractures so this old notion that fractures so this old notion that somehow milk is going to build strong somehow milk is going to build strong somehow milk is going to build strong bones or protect your bones later in bones or protect your bones later in bones or protect your bones later in life it's a myth people that drink milk life it's a myth people that drink milk life it's a myth people that drink milk have higher rates of hip fractures have have higher rates of hip fractures have have higher rates of hip fractures have more cancer and live shorter lives it more cancer and live shorter lives it more cancer and live shorter lives it turns out that countries with the turns out that countries with the turns out that countries with the highest Dairy consumption also have the highest Dairy consumption also have the highest Dairy consumption also have the highest rates of osteoporosis so clearly highest rates of osteoporosis so clearly highest rates of osteoporosis so clearly drinking more milk doesn't protect your drinking more milk doesn't protect your drinking more milk doesn't protect your bones doing more research I found that bones doing more research I found that bones doing more research I found that da was linked to many different types of da was linked to many different types of da was linked to many different types of cancer as well just like many of us I cancer as well just like many of us I cancer as well just like many of us I thought that the majority of cancer was thought that the majority of cancer was thought that the majority of cancer was due to genes but only 5 to 10% of cancer due to genes but only 5 to 10% of cancer due to genes but only 5 to 10% of cancer is actually genetic any cancer is caused is actually genetic any cancer is caused is actually genetic any cancer is caused by a DNA mutation but that's not enough by a DNA mutation but that's not enough by a DNA mutation but that's not enough so that can cause that first cancer cell so that can cause that first cancer cell so that can cause that first cancer cell but one cancer cell never killed anyone but one cancer cell never killed anyone but one cancer cell never killed anyone two cancer cells never killed anyone but two cancer cells never killed anyone but two cancer cells never killed anyone but a billion cancer cells now we're running a billion cancer cells now we're running

The purpose of this group is to empower you to take control of your health and, ideally, reduce or eliminate the need for medications used to manage lifestyle-related diseases. This will be achieved through education on a Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, active living, Intermittent Fasting (IF), and a therapeutic fasting-based lifestyle.\nHousekeeping Rules\n1.Please avoid posting greeting messages.\n2.Do not share forwarded content unless accompanied by your own detailed commentary.\n3.Discussions must remain focused on chronic health issues.\n4.Limit two-way conversations to one round only.\n5. No solicitations are allowed.\nMy Introduction:\nMany members may not know me, so let me introduce myself.\nMy name is Lalit M. Kapoor, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area—specifically in Berkeley. I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1971 and moved to UCLA in 1973 to complete my MBA. I’ve been living in the U.S. ever since.\nAfter successfully selling the companies I started, I retired from business in 2005. Since then, I have pursued health and anti-aging research as a personal passion.\nTwelve years ago, I watched the documentary Forks Over Knives, which deeply resonated with me. I was inspired to adopt the PBWF lifestyle recommended by several doctors featured in the film. Within 18 months, I lost 50 pounds and discontinued five prescription medications. Conditions I overcame include diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, gout, sleep apnea, and seasonal allergies. I felt more energetic than I had in decades—even completing my first half-marathon.\nIn 2017, I created a WhatsApp group for my 1971 IITK batchmates to share my experience. Many reported similar results and successfully reduced or eliminated their medications. As the group grew through referrals, I went on to create over 600 health groups and have coached more than 300,000 members.\nBased on that experience and continued learning and new research in the fields of nutrition and health, I’ve fine-tuned my recommendations. Many members now see improvement within just two weeks. Your progress will depend on your medical history and how consistently you follow the guidance. I made my changes at age 63; others have seen results even at 85. I’ll share their stories with you along the way.\nI will be assisted by Meenakshi Nigam in posting regular content and coaching you through this journey. We will also share short videos and lectures by leading doctors and professors from institutions like UCSF, USC, and Cleveland Clinic. Most videos are 5–10 minutes, with a few longer talks. I strongly encourage you to watch them, as my posts will be brief and may not cover every detail. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words; a video is worth a thousand pictures.\nYou’ll have the opportunity to ask questions, but based on experience, many early questions are answered in subsequent posts. For that reason, Q&A sessions will begin after the first two weeks and occur once per week. During this time, member posting will be paused and reopened periodically for questions.\nDuring the first three weeks the focus will be on:\n• What to eat and what not to eat\n• When to eat and when not to eat\n• How to cook and eat mindfully\n• How to detoxify our body\n• Physical activity\n• Emotional Health\n• Spiritual Health\nDuring fourth week we will cover the political landscape of the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, and explore the influence of government and media.\nBeginning this month the course has been split into two modules. The second module which focusses on Chronic diseases will be offered separately beginning November.\nAs the course progresses, many members begin to see health improvements and share their stories. Most people who follow the guidance are able to discontinue some or most of their medications within months—especially those with hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. While some conditions lack clear metrics, it is difficult to assess progress. Most members report feeling younger and more energetic.\nIt is highly recommended that members of the group share the posts with their spouses and watch the videos and documentaries together. The enrollment in WhatsApp groups has now stopped, please don’t send any requests for adding members. I start a new group every month.\nPast participants report spending 45–60 minutes daily during the first month, reading posts and watching videos. At the end of the one month program, you will be invited to join a geographically organized group of alumni for continued activities and support.\nWhile we waited for others to join, I recommended you watch Forks Over Knives. If you haven’t, please do so immediately. Also, watch its companion documentary Forks Over Knives: Extended Interviews. I will post a list of other documentaries soon.\nIf you are seriously ill or facing urgent medical decisions please consult your physician.\nPlease do not contact me directly. All questions should be asked in the group. With many groups and thousands of members running in parallel—including repeat participants—I ask that everyone follow the group’s pace and not skip ahead.\nThank you.\n————————————\nEND OF POST\n————————————",

        "content": "MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (1)\nBy definition, a myth is \"a widely held but false belief or idea.\" Where do they originate? Most myths are historical and long-held beliefs debunked with scientific knowledge gained through the advancement of science. However, in the modern world of social media, many myths can be intentionally implanted and quickly spread. Sometimes, even in the presence of evidence to the contrary, some myths continue to be propagated by vested interests.\nMyth: HUMANS EVOLVED AS HUNTERS\nHumans evolved as primates about 65 million years ago. Then, around 7 million years ago, we separated from Chimpanzees to Homonins with large brains and smaller teeth and bipedality. Homosapiens evolved about 2 million years ago. As humans evolved, most lived in temperate climates where there was an abundance of fresh produce throughout the year. The control over fire was only achieved about 400 thousand years ago. Prior to that, cooking was not an option. The idea of consuming raw meat in the presence of fresh fruits and vegetables seems unimaginable. Once we controlled fire it is safe to assume people might have moved into the temperate climate zones of Western civilizations, where winters are cold, and food does not grow for 6 months in a year, so societies evolved out of necessity to become meat eaters.\nAlso, until we evolved into the Bronze Age, there were not any tools available for hunting. Can you imagine hunting a buffalo or even a goat or deer with stones? Early humans were more likely to be gatherers and scavengers as opposed to hunters. In addition, human physiology with long intestines and a small jaw and teeth structure suggests that we evolved eating plant-based diets.\nFRESHWATER FISH\nThe only exception appears to be that of freshwater fish. As we moved from one place to another in search of food, we must have camped at places near freshwater. Fish were not so difficult to catch even in the Stone Age. Fish in its raw form is also not intolerable to our palate, as many  who eat Japanese Sushi would attest.\nHUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nAs humans started farming and domesticating animals, we must have started consuming animal milks, eggs, and meat. Eating a cooked masala omelet is much more palatable than raw eggs. The only food processing we were familiar with was peeling, chopping, grinding, mashing, shredding, etc. The concept of ultra-processed food really came into existence during the last century with industrialization. The necessity of feeding soldiers during the two World Wars led to the evolution of food processing and packaging industries. After the wars were over these food companies, with their excess capacities, started marketing more and more ultra-processed foods to the masses.\nMyth: TAKE A PILL WHEN ILL\nThe belief that when you are sick, you should take medicine, and the disease will go away started with the discovery of antibiotics 100 years ago. At the time, most dreaded diseases we faced were infectious diseases like Cholera, Typhoid, Smallpox, Polio, etc. The discovery of the antibiotic Penicillin in 1928 worked like a charm for such diseases. Over the years that followed, we as a society got accustomed to the idea of taking a pill when ill.\nPOST WORLD WAR 2 ERA\nIn the late 1940s, after the World Wars were over, Western governments ensured that food was inexpensive and plentiful. People had suffered food shortages for three decades due to depression and wars. Food got subsidized and even the poor started eating like kings. Chronic diseases, which earlier only affected the rich, became common. With the “take a pill when ill” psyche, it was natural for us to expect miracle drugs from our doctors, and they, along with the pharmaceutical industry, were quick to oblige. However, this time, the drugs did not cure the diseases so the doctors came up with the new explanation that lifestyle diseases are not curable, and doctors can only help manage them by keeping the symptoms in check through lifelong medications.\nDISENCHANTMENT AMONG DOCTORS\nSome doctors, who entered the medical field with a sincere desire to help humanity by curing diseases, slowly became disenchanted and started looking for answers elsewhere. They observed that, just like the wild animals of today and our ancestors of 10,000 years ago, all mammal’s organisms were self-healing, and symptoms were a natural compensatory response of the body. In a sense, symptoms are the messengers giving us clues that everything is not alright.\nBy taking medications to suppress the symptoms we are only interfering with the body’s self-healing mechanism.\nULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD\nAnother observation was that over the years, the profit motive of the food industry had changed the nature of food to refined and ultra-processed food-like products that bore little resemblance to food as we knew it. To increase shelf life fiber was removed and, to increase sales, taste was improved by adding sugar and oils. Experts with PhDs in psychology were deployed to make food taste addictive and non-satiating so people would eat more and buy more. These ultra-processed foods, in fact, were (a) increasing the toxicity of the body and (b) creating deficiencies of nutrients.\nIn addition, the use of inorganic fertilizers and single-crop farming depleted the soil of trace minerals. The produce, though sumptuous and beautiful looking, lacked nutrients, especially micronutrients. Damming rivers to generate hydropower did not help either. As minerals settle down upstream, in the lakes created by dams, it further depletes the soil of trace minerals. Processed and refined foods are not only deficient in nutrients but also full of preservatives. To reduce cost and increase profits, new inexpensive products like hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrups were developed. Deficiencies of nutrients reduce the body’s immunity making it more susceptible to diseases. The abundance of animal food, which was only available to kings and aristocrats earlier, was now available to the masses and caused havoc with their health.\nFinally, this new breed of doctors started to speak out, but their voices were muffled by the powerful lobby of the food, drug, and healthcare industries and the government, eager to please lobbyists with deep pockets. The Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement is the outgrowth of these pioneering voices.\nWHAT IS A PBWF DIET?\nA Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, as the name implies, consists of following:\n- Only plant-based foods. No animal foods, no fish, eggs, or dairy. No butter or ghee.\n- No Refined or ultra-processed foods. No sugar or vegetable oils or refined flours. Take corn for example: Corn on the cob, Corn Soup, Corn Starch and Corn Flour would be considered whole foods. Corn Flakes, Corn Oil  and High Fructose Corn Syrup would be considered Ultra-processed foods.\nThis concept of food as holistic medicine dates back to the period of Hippocrates who said, \"let food be thy medicine.\" Hippocrates may have acquired this knowledge at Takshshila University of India: the world’s largest center of learning at the time. The latest research shows us that when you change your diet to plant based ehole food, your body begins to heal naturally and when your body heals, everything heals, including lifestyle diseases. This is the main theme of this blog as you will see in the weeks to come.\n—————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n—————————————",

        "content": "New Year Resolutions That Are Bound to Fail\nOn January 1, many of you are likely to have made resolutions to join the gym and start working out in new year. Food, along with its timing (as in circadian rhythm) and its absence (as in fasting), is the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and we often fail to recognize it. Physical exercise accounts for only 10-15% of our health yet we are completely enamored by it. What is the reason for such a disconnect?\nMyth: IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT (You Are Eating Too Much and Not Exercising Enough)\nThese words have been repeated by doctors and our elders often referred to as \"gluttony and sloth.\" Have you ever wondered why all mammals in the wild world don't have this problem and we humans didn't have it until a century ago? Wild animals eat as much as they’d like  as often as they’d like. A deer doesn't need a dietitian to dictate its diet. The reason we struggle might be simple: we are eating the wrong foods. The ultraprocessed foods we consume are designed for overconsumption by PhDs in psychology, circumventing our satiation mechanism.\nFLAWED NUTRITION SCIENCE\nNutrition science, as it has evolved over the past century, has gone in the wrong direction of reductionism. Looking at nutrition as individual nutrients and ensuring we get enough by supplementing them worsen the situation. This approach has led to a population where the number of sick people outweighs that of healthy people. Nutrients in food work like a symphony, and focusing on individual nutrients turns a harmonious body into chaos.\nULTRA PROCESSED FOOD\nThe profit motive of the food industry has resulted in an increasing amount of ultra-processed food that is both addictive and non-satiating, circumventing human satiation mechanisms. Additionally, calorie-dense and nutrient-poor food is prevalent. Soil depletion due to organized farming and damming of rivers has not helped either giving rise to a profitable supplements industry.\nOur body is impacted not only by known nutrients but also by nutrients we have not yet discovered. Consuming natural foods provides us with a package of known and not-yet-known nutrients. Supplements, on the other hand, only offer the nutrients we know about. We are not overeating by choice; the problem lies in the food we consume. Someone profits from it, and we find ourselves captive to it.\nAnother fact, studied by Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF, is that when insulin levels are high (common when overeating refined foods), our body wants to conserve energy and avoids physical activity. It's not our fault that we don't want to exercise; it's a result of ultra-processed foods. We are not the problem - the problem is ultra-processed food.\nI will be debunking many such myths that lead us to failure and worsen our health in my course You will learn what I call the Five Pillars of Health, a blueprint for wellbeing that, when followed, can rejuvenate your health and make you feel years younger.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (2)\nMYTH: EAT EVERYTHING IN MODERATION\nThese are “words of wisdom” often uttered by many respectable people including our elders and doctors. The problem with this advice is that when we consume everything in moderation, we also get diseases in moderation. This myth is so pervasive in our society that we have come to expect old age diseases as normal part of aging. What if we are wrong? In fact, we are wrong and it was proven 24 years ago when National Geographic commissioned a study with Dan Buettner, widely known as the Blue Zone Study.\nBlue Zone Study\nDan Buettner identified five communities worldwide with the longest living people: Okinawa (Japan), Sardinia (Italy), Icaria (Greece), Nicoya (Costa Rica) and Loma Linda (California, USA). These places showcased individuals living to 100-105 years without the prevalence of lifestyle diseases associated with old age.\nLessons learnt from these zones include a simple lifestyle, absence of modern processed foods, and daily activities involving over 10,000 steps.\nOUR ANCESTORS LIFE\nOur ancestors in India really did not live long lives. I remember in the 1950’s, if someone lived beyond 75-80 years, his death was celebrated as a life well lived. Today, at the age of 74, I shudder at that thought.\nHow Many Diseases?\nEstimates suggest around 10,000 diseases afflict humans, and the field of medical sciences continues to specialize with over 135 medical specialties. The lack of centralized monitoring for medications prescribed by specialists adds complexity to addressing negative side effects and adverse drug reactions.\nMYTH: DIFFERENT DIETS FOR DIFFERENT DISEASES\nMost people have a belief that there must be a different diet plan recommendation for different illnesses. The most common question asked in my health groups is “I suffer from X, Y and Z. What should I eat?”  Food should be healthy to prevent all diseases, if not, it would create an unresolvable dilemma as to what diseases should I treat and which ones suffer. This is likely one or the biggest myth of all and is continuously propagated by many dietitians, doctors, naturopaths and health spas. Just imagine you are suffering from diseases X, Y and Z and you are prescribed the following diet:\n-For disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P\n-For disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R and avoid  C, G, M, S & Q\n-For disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S and avoid  A, G, K, P & T\nHow would you figure out what to eat and what to avoid? The premise that there is a special diet for every disease is fundamentally flawed. When you eat a Plant Based Whole Food diet, with a diverse variety of foods in each food group, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and it heals. And when body heals everything heals.\nSelf Selection\nWhen we look around in wilderness we find that animals living there eat whatever they want whenever they want and as much as they want. Why are humans are incapable of doing that? Why do we have to consult a dietitian to find out what to eat, what not to eat, how much to eat and when to eat it? During the 1930s many studies were done on this subject of self selection and it was found that, over an extended period of time, animals were able to self select their food choices in a way that their bodies remained healthy without creating any deficiency or excesses. One such study done in Canada in the 1930s on young children found that over a period of 6 months when children were left to themselves to select their food, from a buffet of varied choices, they did fine and there were no deficiencies or excesses. It was concluded that among young children the process of self selection works fine.\nSo the question arises as to why we lose this innate ability to self select our own food. The answer lies in the fact that we human are social animals and as we grow up our decisions are based on more than physiology. We start consuming foods not necessarily because we find them tasty and rewarding but also because they fulfill our psychological needs: to show off, feel grown up or to belong to a certain clique. Many addictions like tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco start that way. Nobody likes these at first and many find their taste and feel unpleasant.\nDesigner Foods\nSome foods are designed in ways to create a dopamine response that we find rewarding like refined fat and sugar. Even these foods, if not tinkered with by specialists, are likely to satiate us quickly and not lead to much overconsumption. However, when foods are designed by expert psychologists who know how to circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism we fall prey to them, wanting to eat more and more. The best example to make this point is potato chips. When you make them at home you can’t eat more than a dozen or so without feeling satiated. When you eat Pringles chips you can keep eating one after another until the box is empty. In fact, the company took pride in that and their advertising tag line was “Once you pop, you can't stop.” It is important to take conscious approach to our dietary choices.\nDiet Alone is Not the Solution\nSimilarly looking for all solutions in diet alone is also a flawed approach and needs correction. Recent research and Nobel prizes awarded in 2016, 2017 and 2018 have shown that when to eat (as in Circadian Rhythm) and when not to eat (as in fasting) are often equally important. In addition, the new science of microbes colonizing our colon called Epigenetics is creating a paradigm shift in our understanding of nutrition and diseases. Its impact is still not well understood but we are getting many clues.\nMany people do not follow lifestyle recommendations like intermittent fasting or Ekadashi fasting or Navratri fasting which are essential for detoxifying the body. Also many people eat late dinners (after it is dark outside) and go to bed shortly thereafter. These lifestyle choices impact our health in ways we are only beginning to understand.\nIn the coming weeks we will delve into lifestyle choices, like fasting, and their impact on health. Stay tuned.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Myth: HUMANS ARE VERY SIMILAR\nIt's been commonly assumed in medical research that all humans are similar, and therefore, findings from a small group can be generalized across the population, aside from racial and socioeconomic variations. Humans are indeed genetically similar, which underpins the belief that clinical studies on one group are applicable to others if they share racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of the recent studies have shattered this myth beyond doubt beginning with Human Genome Project.\nHuman Genome Project (1990-2003)\nThis project involved six of the world's wealthiest countries, including the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, France, and the UK. The U.S. alone invested 3 billion dollars in the project, which aimed to map an individual's genome and predict their medical future, similar to a medical horoscope. However, the results revealed a surprising complexity, with human genes outnumbering expectations by a hundredfold. The mystery unraveled when it was discovered that the human body contains about 38 trillion foreign cells, mainly microbes in the colon, outnumbering its own 37 trillion human cells. These microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, constitute our microbiota, with their genetic material forming our microbiome, significantly influenced by our diet and lifestyle.\nHuman Microbiome Project (2007 - Present)\nTo study the effects of bacteria on our health another project was undertaken in 2007 called the Human Microbiome Project. This resulted in a major shift in how we perceive and address health problems. For example we learned that:\n1. Identical twins can be as much as 70% apart due to changes in their diet and lifestyle.\n2. The same cause can manifest as different symptoms among different people.\n3. The same symptoms can stem from different causes in different people.\n4. Diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science, often with hits and misses.\nThis new science is creating a whole new field of fecal transplantation. For example studies have shown that a fecal transplantation from a slim mouse into the colon of a fat mouse can make it lose weight easily within months. This is an active frontier in medical science today.\nEpigenetics was featured on the cover of TIME magazine in January 2010. A helpful way to grasp the distinction between genetics and epigenetics is to think of it in terms of a mobile phone's hardware and its application software. Essentially, the hardware in all mobile phones is quite similar regardless of the manufacturer. Yet, the phone's functionality and appearance can vary significantly depending on the software it runs. In a similar vein, while our genetic makeup (like the phone's hardware) is fundamentally the same, epigenetics (akin to the software) determines how these genes are expressed, leading to notable differences from one individual to another.\nAmerican Gut Project (2013-2018)\nAnother project, the American Gut Project, started in 2013, analyzed gut microbiome data from people from 45 countries. The findings released in 2018 unveiled many surprises. The study divided people into two groups—one consuming 10 or less plant-based foods and the other consuming over 30 different plant food varieties. The study found that the first group suffered from many metabolic diseases and had low immunity, while the second group had few diseases and rarely suffered from viral infections.\nMyth: IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT (Overeating and Lack of Exercise)\nWhen we visit a doctor and our first lifestyle disease is diagnosed (generally high Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, or Cholesterol), the doctors put the blame squarely on us saying “You are eating too much and not exercising enough\" commonly referred to as \"gluttony and sloth.\" The doctors don’t explain why we are doing so; it's not taught to them in medical colleges.\nThe reason is simple: we are eating the wrong foods. Ultraprocessed foods are designed for overconsumption by Ph.D.s in psychology. They circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism.\nI remember the night Al Gore lost US presidential election to Bush in November 2000, I was in Mumbai and bought a pint of Mumbai’s famous Natural’s custard apple ice cream. The election results were so close and interesting that I finished the whole pint of ice cream without even realizing it. I didn’t achieve the satiation point. My stomach was sick but mind wanted more. This is what is happening to most of us. We are not suicidal and we are not overeating by choice. The food is designed for over consumption. Somebody is profiting from it and got us captive.\nDr. Robert Lustig of University of California, SanFrancisco has dedicated his life to research on this subject on obese children. He has found that when insulin levels are high (from overeating refined carbs), our body conserves energy and is less inclined to engage in physical activity. All these obese kids wanted to do was eat chips, cookies, ice cream and drink Cola and watch TV. They had no interest in playing outdoors. When their food was changed and insulin level reduced by medication, they started going out to play. We must understand that it is not our fault and it is definitely not a character flaw like gluttony and sloth in us as we are told. It is also the same ultra-processed foods (caloric dense nutrient poor) that make us deficient in nutrients. So as you can see the problem is not us the problem is the food.\nMyth: THE SOIL IS DEPLETED SO YOU NEED SUPPLEMENTS\nThe food supplements industry is $164 billion in the U.S. alone. There is some validity to the argument that due to damming of rivers and single crop farming, the soil has become depleted of many trace minerals. Plants produced today may not be as rich in nutrients as a century ago, but instead of taking supplements, increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can overcome these deficiencies.\nAs it is, our consumption of fresh produce has become a fraction of just two generations ago. So by simply increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables all deficiencies can be overcome. There is no need for supplements. The only exception is Vitamin B12 which our body made in the presence of a certain bacteria found in soil and ground water. As municipal supplies of water is chlorinated we do not get that bacteria.\nOne must also understand that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about but how about the nutrients that are not-yet-known (NYKnowns). They are missing from the supplements and therefore supplements often cause imbalances.\nOne classic example of this is a study that showed that cardiac patients who were given Beta Carotene supplements died earlier compared to the control group. This was because, (as we now know) there are 750 different carotenoids of which human body needs 50. By supplementing only Beta Carotene (known nutrient) body developed deficiency in other 49 carotenoids (NYKnowns at the time).\nIn conclusion, eating a diverse variety of plant foods, avoiding processed refined foods, and supplements, and listening to your body's signals are key to achieving a proper nutrient balance.",

        "content": "•Myth: BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY•\nWhat does “better safe than sorry” mean to you?\nMost people believe it is safer to continue taking certain medications rather than risk slightly elevated blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol levels. But WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.\nIn recent years, many senior doctors have realized that we've swung too far towards medicating lifestyle diseases. Studies from the past two decades suggest that excessive medication can often be more harmful than no medication at all. This phenomenon is known as the J-Curve. Progressive doctors have been vocal against overmedication for controlling blood pressure, sugar, and cholesterol. As a result, guidelines for medication thresholds have been revised. However, these changes haven't been widely disseminated, leading many doctors to follow outdated guidelines.\nLater in this blog, I'll present evidence supporting the revision of these guidelines towards more moderate medication thresholds. We'll also delve into the politics of the pharmaceutical, food, and healthcare industries, and examine the roles government and media play in our health.\nEmerging evidence shows that previous approaches were flawed and potentially more harmful. Many doctors are now reevaluating their recommendations for treatment and testing. The increased specialization in medicine often leads to tunnel vision, neglecting the overall quality of life and mortality. Furthermore, our understanding of drug interactions is limited, and prescriptions from multiple specialists can lead to Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). I'll cover ADRs more in future blogs.\nHuman Body is Self Healing\n\"The human body is a remarkable self-healing mechanism, often smarter than we acknowledge. It adeptly copes with the diet and lifestyle it encounters. Elevated blood pressure, sugar, or cholesterol levels are often the body’s compensatory responses to various conditions.\nHowever, the body struggles with synthetic medications. These substances are foreign and can disrupt the body's natural compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, they place a strain on the liver and kidneys, affecting them in ways not fully understood.\nTo be safe, it's advisable to first address diet and lifestyle changes, allowing the body to naturally adjust these health markers. Of course, always seek medical advice and discuss your preferences with your doctor.\nJ -CURVE Concept\nIt's well-known that symptoms like high blood pressure or blood sugar are detrimental to health and, if uncontrolled, can lead to a shortened lifespan. Diseases typically follow a slanted S-curve, indicating that minor deviations from normal levels are less harmful and more manageable than more severe deviations. The impact on life expectancy isn't linear; a slight worsening of health markers is more concerning at advanced levels. For instance, a 10% increase in systolic blood pressure from 120 to 132 is concerning, but not alarmingly so. However, a 10% rise from 140 to 154 is significantly worrying. If it jumps 10% from 190 to 209, it becomes critical and demands immediate action.\nWe also know that all medications  have some negative side effects which may reduce our life expectancy. So clearly minimizing or eliminating medications should be a goal. Some BP patients are on a single pill which may not be as harmful, but some are on 6-7 different pills just for controlling BP. That situation is not at all desirable and if the person is also on diabetic or statin medications, it can harm in ways we do not fully understand.\nGiven the considerations mentioned, many senior doctors are now questioning the wisdom of stringently controlling health markers with aggressive medication. Recent studies have been conducted to assess the impact of such medications and disease markers on overall life expectancy. These studies indicate that optimal results are often achieved with a moderate approach.\nACCORD Study\nThe Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, initiated in September 1999 and sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is a significant example. This study aimed to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control, blood pressure management, and multiple lipid management on major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study, a landmark in its field, was supported by several collaborators:\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n- National Institute on Aging (NIA)\n- National Eye Institute (NEI)\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe researchers initially hoped that tighter control of blood sugar and blood pressure would enhance life expectancy. However, within eight years, it became evident that such stringent controls were, in fact, increasing all-cause mortality rates among patients. Consequently, the duration of the study was curtailed, as it would have been unethical to continue exposing patients to such risks. The chart below presents the raw data from the ACCORD study, which the American College of Physicians (ACP) used to revise their diabetes guidelines in 2018. It is noteworthy that even they took a decade to update their guidelines.\nThe link to their announcement of March 6, 2018 is given below.\nhttps://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/acp-recommends-moderate-blood-sugar-control-targets-for-most-patients-with-type-2-diabetes\nAfter the ACCORD study, many doctors called for a revision of the guidelines for blood pressure and blood sugar medications. In response, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-8) revised its blood pressure control guidelines in 2014 as shown below.\nThe American College of Physicians updated their diabetes guidelines in March 2018. Both revisions faced objections from those whose income was most affected. In US, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) was pressured to disband the JNC, which had served for over four decades and transfer authority to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).\nThe American College of Physicians (ACP) 2018 diabetes guideline revision alarmed the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) so much so that they reinstated their own, more restrictive guidelines within seven days. I will discuss these issues in more detail in the coming months under the topic of the Politics of Diet & Health. For now, my aim is to inform you about the J-Curve and why it occurs. Many of you may not be aware of these recent revisions and could be overmedicating. I recommend discussing this with your healthcare providers as soon as possible.",

        "content": "••• PROTEIN MYTH •••\nThere are many myths related to protein in our society propagated, knowingly or unknowingly, by many in the food and healthcare industries. These myths include the belief that\n* The human body needs a lot of protein\n* Protein is hard to find in food\n* Plant protein is somehow inferior to animal protein and doesn’t contain all amino acids.\nEven the United State's Food & Drug Administration (FDA), in its MyPlate guidelines, suggests the need for special foods to consume protein, as implied in their recommendations below.\nThe problem with this MyPlate recommendation is that fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy all contain protein, creating a misconception that special foods are necessary. The past head of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health criticized these guidelines as \"utterly ridiculous.\"\nHere are some facts pointing to the opposite conclusion:\n- The human body needs very little protein, as evidenced by the low protein content in mother's milk, which fuels newborns who are at the fastest growth stage of their life.\n-All proteins are made up of 20 amino acids in a chain configuration. Our body is able to make 11 but the remaining nine amino acids have to be consumed. For that reason they are called essential. It has been a long held myth that some of these nine are absent from some plant foods. For example it was believed that rice does not have lysine and beans do not have methionine. It is for this reason it was recommended that grains and beans should be combined in a balanced diet.\nWe now know that plant proteins contain all essential amino acids, but their distribution varies among food groups. Eating from all five food groups ensures no deficiency. However it is still a good idea to combine beans & legumes with grains as in daal-chawal (legume-rice) or Idli or Khichri.\n- Protein is abundantly found in plant foods. For example, as a percentage of total calories, rice has 7%, watermelon 8%, guava 14%, romaine lettuce 19%, and spinach 30%. Potatoes have a similar protein content to mother's milk at 5-6%.\nHistory of Protein\nProtein was discovered in 1839 by German scientist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named for the Greek word Proteios, meaning \"of prime importance.\" The US Government, in 1947, established the minimum protein requirement for humans at 5-6% of total calories, They were so concerned about protein deficiency (due to popular beliefs that physical labor and gym enthusiasts need more protein) that they wanted to include 98% of the population in their Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and therefore recommended a high figure of 8-10 percent of total calories requirement which amounted to 0.8 gram per kilogram of body weight. This amounts to 48 grams (240 calories) for a person weighing 60 kilograms or 10% (assuming 2,400 total calories a day). We did not know until 1899 that plant foods also have protein. For a long time plant protein was considered inferior to animal protein because it was believed to lack all essential amino acids which is incorrect.\nHuman Proteome Project (2011-Now)\nMost people know about a project called the “Human Genome Project” which was undertaken in 1990. Few are aware of “Human Proteome Project” that was undertaken a few years later to map all the proteins in human body. The science emerging from this ongoing project is called Proteomics. For reasons unknown to me, the findings of the Proteome project are not picked up by the mass media or social media much. I believe it may have something to do with its potential impact on the food industry especially meat, poultry and dairy. Here is what we now know about proteins in the human body:\n* Most humans need very little protein, only about 8% of their total calories.\n* An average adult body produces around 250 grams of new proteins daily and breaks down a similar amount due to wear and tear.\n* The body efficiently recycles spent proteins into amino acids for new protein synthesis, but certain proteins like nails, hair, and dead skin cannot be recycled, resulting in a 15% shortfall from the daily requirement for individuals burning 2,400 calories, equivalent to 36 grams.\n* The US Government's conservative recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight covers 98% of the population, potentially leading to overconsumption by 97% of the population, statistically speaking.\n* Excessive protein, especially from animal sources, can be harmful to the liver and kidneys, shortening their healthy lifespan.\n* Periodic protein absence as during fasting, promotes autophagy (the recycling of dead and damaged cells). Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi received the 2016 Nobel Prize for his discoveries.\n* Prolonged protein absence (9-10 days) can contribute to building immunity against major diseases like cancer as acknowledged by the 2018 Nobel Prize given to Dr. Tasuku Honjo. Practices like the Navratri fast among Hindus and Peryushan fast among Jains share this health objective.\n* Individuals who perform intense workouts or manual labor obtain extra protein through increased calorie consumption, eliminating the need for richer protein foods as the body efficiently recycles most excess spent protein generated during exercise.\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Minimum\nThe food industry in its zeal to sell more animal food, distorted the minimum and recommended guidelines established by the US government and somehow the recommended amount was labeled as the minimum. Even leading universities, which are now mostly governed by Food and Drug Industries, are guilty of these distortions as you can see by performing a google search on “protein”. Until recently this search revealed that these distortions appear on prestigious web sites such as Healthline, WebMD and Harvard Health, which I quote below:\n“The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.”\nThe above statement was a total lie. The site has now been revised and shows a lower recommendation of 0.8 gram per kilogram only. It may surprise you to note that there is not a single recorded case of protein deficiency in the civilized world.  Ninety seven percent of all Americans eat too much protein while at the same time 97% of all American diets are deficient in dietary fiber. Fiber is not found in any animal food or ultra-processed food. The nutrient of concern therefore should be fiber and not protein. Sadly press coverages on dangers of excessive protein consumption do not exist and the topic is conveniently ignored by mass media. This is in spite of doctors such as Dr. Colin Campbell (Cornel University), Dr Christopher Gardner (Stanford University) and Dr.Janice Stanger (UCLA) speaking about it at major conferences and in various documentaries and YouTube videos.\nWhy is Animal Protein Harmful?\nAll animal protein comes with the IGF-1 hormone. This hormone helps animals grow rapidly. For example a 50 pound newborn calf becomes a 500 pound bull in 6 months. The IGF-1 hormone is very harmful in humans as it promotes growth of cancer cells which are already present in the body fluids of most people living in the civilized world.\nTo make my point I like to give an example of a popular fertilizer in the United States called “Miracle Grow”. This fertilizer makes lawn grow very lush and green. However the lawn does not grow any taller. The thickness of the lawn depends upon the variety of the grass. It would only rise few inches above the soil. But if there are any weeds in the lawn, miracle grow makes them grow very tall very fast. This is because the weeds do not have auto truncating mechanism in their genes. Similarly human body has a built in truncating mechanism dictated by our genes. Our ring finger cannot become longer than the middle finger. When we consume IGF-1 hormone, it expedites the growth but our body cannot grow disproportionately. However any cancer cells, that are present in our body, do grow rapidly in the presence of IGF-1 hormone. This is why cancer growth gets promoted upon consumption of the IGF-1 hormone that accompanies animal protein.\nA study by Padambhushan Dr. Gopalan and Madhavan at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad in 1967 had demonstrated that, in the presence of carcinogens and sufficient food, animal protein can cause cancer cells to grow (we will discuss this more when we discuss the dairy myth).\nStudies also show associations between animal protein consumption and increased renal cancer cases, elevated LDL cholesterol and higher blood sugar levels.\nWhy is Excess Protein Harmful?\nOf the three macronutrients that provide energy to sustain life, only protein has nitrogen. The others, carbohydrates and fat, are made up of only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Our body has subcutaneous fat cells that can store an almost unlimited amount of fat; it can also store up to 2,000 calories of sugar but it has no provision to store protein.\nWhen we eat more protein than needed, which most of us in the civilized world do, our body faces a problem: What do we do with that extra protein? The liver, which is the chemical factory in our body, removes the nitrogen from the protein and makes fat and ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is toxic, so the body combines it with water and converts it to uric acid.\nThe kidneys then filter it out as urine. This taxes two of our critical organs: the kidney and liver. This is a leading cause for kidney and liver failures at later stages in life in the civilized world. Additionally, when there is excess uric acid it crystallizes and the body tries to move it as far away as possible and deposits it into the big toe as uric acid crystals. This condition is called gout. Many French paintings from the Renaissance period show over weight royalties suffering from this disease.\nAs a society our protein consumption (from meat, eggs and dairy) has increased multi fold in the past seven decades after World War 2. This has led to the growth of many lifestyle diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart diseases, Strokes, Dementia, Kidney and Liver diseases.\nAnti-Aging Benefits of Protein Restriction\nRecent research in the anti-aging field suggests that of all the major factors helping with anti-aging, restrictions on protein consumption is the most important. It helps in many ways including\n1. Improves immunity\n2. Decreases Oxidative stress\n3. Decreases Inflammation\n4. Decreases Insulin Resistance\n5. Decreases cancer promoting growth hormones\nThe latest book by Dr. Greger “How Not To Age” deals with this subject in detail and I highly recommend it.\nBenefits of Occasional Protein Deficiency\nThe two Nobel prizes on fasting in 2016 and 2018 have demonstrated that absences of protein during fasting is very beneficial for human health. It leads to autophagy, whereby the body recycles its dead and damaged cells to get amino acids and make new cells. The net effect is that the body’s average cell age reduces. It is for this reason I recommend that one should keep Ekadashi and Navratri fasts. We will cover this subject in detail when we discuss the second pillar of health: Detoxification.\nPersonal Case History\nThe Protein myth has been so prevalent in our society that I am reminded of the 1950’s when my grandfather insisted that I drink a glass of milk every morning with an egg yolk (not to mention the sugar which was always added to milk in India in those days). While I hated drinking it, I had no choice in the matter. Little did my grandfather know that he was causing me harm. He had the best of intentions and, based on the prevalent wisdom at the time, he was doing the right thing.\nProtein for Muscles?\nAnother misconception about protein is that eating protein builds muscles. If it was so easy, every man would look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Muscles develop when we exercise them. The famous gladiators of the Roman period 2,000 years ago, who had to fight for life every day, were all vegans. Please watch the documentary “The Game Changers”. This is also discussed in the documentary “Forks over Knives”.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the emphasis on protein consumption, especially from animal sources, has led to widespread misconceptions and health issues in our society. It is crucial to reevaluate dietary guidelines and focus on a balanced and plant-based approach for overall well-being.\nPlease read Dr. John McDougall’s article on the subject and\nwatch the talk about no the dangers of excessive protein and animal protein in the following videos by Dr. Janice Stanger of UCLA and Dr. Christopher Gardner of Stanford University and Dr. Colin Campbell. 👇\nDr. Janice Stanger of UCLA: The Dangerous Truth About Protein\nhttps://youtu.be/2R07FL1wVo4\nDr. Christopher Gardner of Stanford University: Everything You Thought You Knew About Protein Is Wrong",

truth about is entitled the dangerous truth about is entitled the dangerous truth about protein please join me in welcoming Dr protein please join me in welcoming Dr protein please join me in welcoming Dr Janice Stanger okay you've probably learned a Stanger okay you've probably learned a pretty commonplace understanding about pretty commonplace understanding about pretty commonplace understanding about protein that it's a superstar protein that it's a superstar protein that it's a superstar nutrient that it magically builds muscle nutrient that it magically builds muscle nutrient that it magically builds muscle just by eating it and helps you get thin just by eating it and helps you get thin just by eating it and helps you get thin and that it's something that's very rare and that it's something that's very rare and that it's something that's very rare and hard to get and you have to and hard to get and you have to and hard to get and you have to specially Source it from certain foods specially Source it from certain foods specially Source it from certain foods well what we're going to learn tonight well what we're going to learn tonight well what we're going to learn tonight is going to totally shred that is going to totally shred that is going to totally shred that misunderstanding and what you learn will misunderstanding and what you learn will misunderstanding and what you learn will enable you to make much better choices enable you to make much better choices enable you to make much better choices in terms of the foods you eat because in in terms of the foods you eat because in in terms of the foods you eat because in fact protein is actually a very abundant fact protein is actually a very abundant fact protein is actually a very abundant nutrient it's one of the most abundant nutrient it's one of the most abundant nutrient it's one of the most abundant nutrients there is it's very easy to nutrients there is it's very easy to nutrients there is it's very easy to consume to excess on a standard American consume to excess on a standard American consume to excess on a standard American diet and in fact if you eat excess it diet and in fact if you eat excess it diet and in fact if you eat excess it can actually be very dangerous for you can actually be very dangerous for you can actually be very dangerous for you so this will give you information to be so this will give you information to be so this will give you information to be able to make much better health able to make much better health able to make much better health choices so there's just tons of choices so there's just tons of choices so there's just tons of misinformation circulating out there misinformation circulating out there misinformation circulating out there from just so many different sources and from just so many different sources and from just so many different sources and one of them is actually all our own one of them is actually all our own one of them is actually all our own government the US Department of government the US Department of government the US Department of Agriculture so let's start out looking Agriculture so let's start out looking Agriculture so let's start out looking at that one at that one at that one so protein is an icon and there's so protein is an icon and there's so protein is an icon and there's something very peculiar about this plate something very peculiar about this plate something very peculiar about this plate this plate is called to choose my plate this plate is called to choose my plate this plate is called to choose my plate it's the usda's latest version of what it's the usda's latest version of what it's the usda's latest version of what we're all supposed to be eating and we're all supposed to be eating and we're all supposed to be eating and there's a lot of fallacies on this plate there's a lot of fallacies on this plate there's a lot of fallacies on this plate for example the dairy fallacy that we're for example the dairy fallacy that we're for example the dairy fallacy that we're not talking about tonight but the oddest not talking about tonight but the oddest not talking about tonight but the oddest thing about this plate which really thing about this plate which really thing about this plate which really struck me very strongly the first time I struck me very strongly the first time I struck me very strongly the first time I saw it is that protein is broken out as saw it is that protein is broken out as saw it is that protein is broken out as the only nutrient on this plate so if the only nutrient on this plate so if the only nutrient on this plate so if you look at what the USDA is telling us you look at what the USDA is telling us you look at what the USDA is telling us to eat everything else on here is a food to eat everything else on here is a food to eat everything else on here is a food right you could go to the supermarket right you could go to the supermarket right you could go to the supermarket you could find it you could point to it you could find it you could point to it you could find it you could point to it you could go that's a vegetable that's a you could go that's a vegetable that's a you could go that's a vegetable that's a grain that's Dairy you can't do that grain that's Dairy you can't do that grain that's Dairy you can't do that with protein so the mindset they're with protein so the mindset they're with protein so the mindset they're trying to establish here is their trying to establish here is their trying to establish here is their protein is so rare that you actually protein is so rare that you actually protein is so rare that you actually have to get special foods to get it and have to get special foods to get it and have to get special foods to get it and it kind of tells you implicitly that it kind of tells you implicitly that it kind of tells you implicitly that there's no protein in your vegetables there's no protein in your vegetables there's no protein in your vegetables fruits grains or even in your Dairy fruits grains or even in your Dairy fruits grains or even in your Dairy because it's something that's so because it's something that's so because it's something that's so uncommon so what does that lead to it uncommon so what does that lead to it uncommon so what does that lead to it leads to a lot of things in terms of leads to a lot of things in terms of leads to a lot of things in terms of business you can see here this is an business you can see here this is an business you can see here this is an aisle that's in just about any aisle that's in just about any aisle that's in just about any Supermarket these days this Supermarket Supermarket these days this Supermarket Supermarket these days this Supermarket kind of comically calls it the nutrition kind of comically calls it the nutrition kind of comically calls it the nutrition aisle because it's actually more like aisle because it's actually more like aisle because it's actually more like the anti nutrition aisle but what you the anti nutrition aisle but what you the anti nutrition aisle but what you see here are all kinds of protein see here are all kinds of protein see here are all kinds of protein products a lot of them are powders I products a lot of them are powders I products a lot of them are powders I mean I'm sure you've all seen this mean I'm sure you've all seen this mean I'm sure you've all seen this aisles are going almost forever with aisles are going almost forever with aisles are going almost forever with protein powders a lot of them are from protein powders a lot of them are from protein powders a lot of them are from whey which is actually a byproduct of whey which is actually a byproduct of whey which is actually a byproduct of making cheese a lot of them are also making cheese a lot of them are also making cheese a lot of them are also Source from different kind of plants and Source from different kind of plants and Source from different kind of plants and they're also put into not just powders they're also put into not just powders they're also put into not just powders but brownies and food bars and but brownies and food bars and but brownies and food bars and everything else you can think of so everything else you can think of so everything else you can think of so again this is highly profitable and again this is highly profitable and again this is highly profitable and people really are kind of making a lot people really are kind of making a lot people really are kind of making a lot of money off this misinformation about of money off this misinformation about of money off this misinformation about protein but luckily there's a new protein but luckily there's a new protein but luckily there's a new science now and it's called science now and it's called science now and it's called proteomics and proteomics is something proteomics and proteomics is something proteomics and proteomics is something that will give us a lot more good that will give us a lot more good that will give us a lot more good information so let's look at some of the information so let's look at some of the information so let's look at some of the basic facts this this science came to be basic facts this this science came to be basic facts this this science came to be in about very recently but actually the in about very recently but actually the in about very recently but actually the discovery of protein goes back to 1838 discovery of protein goes back to 1838 discovery of protein goes back to 1838 175 years ago two European scientists 175 years ago two European scientists 175 years ago two European scientists discover protein and they gave it this discover protein and they gave it this discover protein and they gave it this name because they thought it was very name because they thought it was very name because they thought it was very important because the cons Greek word important because the cons Greek word important because the cons Greek word meaning of prime importance and there a meaning of prime importance and there a meaning of prime importance and there a lot of misinformation started swirling lot of misinformation started swirling lot of misinformation started swirling at that time and unfortunately it's at that time and unfortunately it's at that time and unfortunately it's still out there so let's really start still out there so let's really start still out there so let's really start seeing some of the basic facts okay so I seeing some of the basic facts okay so I seeing some of the basic facts okay so I want to ask you this so how many kinds want to ask you this so how many kinds want to ask you this so how many kinds of protein do you Sinker in your body of protein do you Sinker in your body of protein do you Sinker in your body you being the average person okay so you being the average person okay so you being the average person okay so we'll just do this by show hands cuz we'll just do this by show hands cuz we'll just do this by show hands cuz there's kind of too many people to count there's kind of too many people to count there's kind of too many people to count so how many people think they have one so how many people think they have one so how many people think they have one to9 999 kinds of protein in their to9 999 kinds of protein in their to9 999 kinds of protein in their body okay how many people think they body okay how many people think they body okay how many people think they have 100 to 9.99 that one's a little less popular 9.99 that one's a little less popular how many think they have a th000 up to how many think they have a th000 up to how many think they have a th000 up to close to close to close to 10,000 okay and how many think they have 10,000 okay and how many think they have 10,000 okay and how many think they have over over over 10,000 okay pretty good so I'd say about 10,000 okay pretty good so I'd say about 10,000 okay pretty good so I'd say about half the people think they have over half the people think they have over half the people think they have over 10,000 and about half think they have 10,000 and about half think they have 10,000 and about half think they have under under under 10,000 in fact according to American 10,000 in fact according to American 10,000 in fact according to American Medical Association we each have about 2 Medical Association we each have about 2 Medical Association we each have about 2 million kinds of protein in our body and million kinds of protein in our body and million kinds of protein in our body and we'll see soon why that can be when we we'll see soon why that can be when we we'll see soon why that can be when we see what protein's made of why you could see what protein's made of why you could see what protein's made of why you could actually have so many and it doesn't actually have so many and it doesn't actually have so many and it doesn't even begin to put a small dent in the even begin to put a small dent in the even begin to put a small dent in the kinds of protein that could kinds of protein that could kinds of protein that could theoretically be made so of every 100 theoretically be made so of every 100 theoretically be made so of every 100 calories in human breast milk how many calories in human breast milk how many calories in human breast milk how many calories come from protein this would be calories come from protein this would be calories come from protein this would be the milk that a nursing mother produces the milk that a nursing mother produces the milk that a nursing mother produces so how many people think it's one to so how many people think it's one to so how many people think it's one to four four four calories okay not too many how many calories okay not too many how many calories okay not too many how many think it's 5 think it's 5 think it's 5 to8 okay how many think the mom has 9 to to8 okay how many think the mom has 9 to to8 okay how many think the mom has 9 to 15 calories worth of protein and how 15 calories worth of protein and how 15 calories worth of protein and how many think 16 or many think 16 or many think 16 or more okay that's a vast majority of more okay that's a vast majority of more okay that's a vast majority of people the correct answer is actually B people the correct answer is actually B people the correct answer is actually B so in a nursing infant one of the main so in a nursing infant one of the main so in a nursing infant one of the main functions of protein in the body is to functions of protein in the body is to functions of protein in the body is to fuel growth so the time of life when fuel growth so the time of life when fuel growth so the time of life when we're growing the fastest which is in we're growing the fastest which is in we're growing the fastest which is in infancy infancy infancy actually only 5 to 8% of the calories actually only 5 to 8% of the calories actually only 5 to 8% of the calories that the infant is consuming come from that the infant is consuming come from that the infant is consuming come from protein so that should tell you a little protein so that should tell you a little protein so that should tell you a little bit about our protein nutritional bit about our protein nutritional bit about our protein nutritional needs but there is something very needs but there is something very needs but there is something very special about protein so the people who special about protein so the people who special about protein so the people who think protein's very special they're think protein's very special they're think protein's very special they're actually onto a truth here which is that actually onto a truth here which is that actually onto a truth here which is that protein equals life so the part of you protein equals life so the part of you protein equals life so the part of you that's alive the part of you that that's alive the part of you that that's alive the part of you that breathes and thinks and reproduces and breathes and thinks and reproduces and breathes and thinks and reproduces and eats and does all that good stuff eats and does all that good stuff eats and does all that good stuff actually is the protein part of you actually is the protein part of you actually is the protein part of you because the other parts of you like because the other parts of you like because the other parts of you like water and minerals actually aren't water and minerals actually aren't water and minerals actually aren't alive and this is true this is the alive and this is true this is the alive and this is true this is the important thing it's true not just of important thing it's true not just of important thing it's true not just of animals but it's true of plants so we animals but it's true of plants so we animals but it's true of plants so we all know plants are alive and the part all know plants are alive and the part all know plants are alive and the part of plants that's living are also their of plants that's living are also their of plants that's living are also their proteins and proteins different proteins proteins and proteins different proteins proteins and proteins different proteins are what makes each species unique from are what makes each species unique from are what makes each species unique from each other species and also makes every each other species and also makes every each other species and also makes every single individual within that species single individual within that species single individual within that species unique from every other individual so let's see why that is and individual so let's see why that is and the reason it is and the reason you can the reason it is and the reason you can the reason it is and the reason you can have so many millions of kinds of have so many millions of kinds of have so many millions of kinds of proteins is because they're link chains proteins is because they're link chains proteins is because they're link chains so I just happened to so I just happened to so I just happened to bring a protein chain with me to kind of bring a protein chain with me to kind of bring a protein chain with me to kind of illustrate this fact so here's my little illustrate this fact so here's my little illustrate this fact so here's my little protein chain and in actuality the protein chain and in actuality the protein chain and in actuality the protein chain would be a lot longer protein chain would be a lot longer protein chain would be a lot longer because there's hundreds to thousands of because there's hundreds to thousands of because there's hundreds to thousands of these little little links in each these little little links in each these little little links in each protein chain so the chain itself is a protein chain so the chain itself is a protein chain so the chain itself is a protein so what are the little links protein so what are the little links protein so what are the little links this is the most important thing we're this is the most important thing we're this is the most important thing we're getting to the little links are called getting to the little links are called getting to the little links are called amino amino amino acids okay so these amino acids when acids okay so these amino acids when acids okay so these amino acids when they're linked together kind of like they're linked together kind of like they're linked together kind of like they're length in this chain and then they're length in this chain and then they're length in this chain and then they get folded a certain way are what they get folded a certain way are what they get folded a certain way are what make up a make up a make up a protein so you really don't need protein protein so you really don't need protein protein so you really don't need protein at all what you need are amino acids at all what you need are amino acids at all what you need are amino acids because remember your amino acids are because remember your amino acids are because remember your amino acids are unique and so if you if not your Amino unique and so if you if not your Amino unique and so if you if not your Amino your proteins are unique and your amino your proteins are unique and your amino your proteins are unique and your amino acids are what make up your protein so acids are what make up your protein so acids are what make up your protein so since your protein is unique you can't since your protein is unique you can't since your protein is unique you can't get that protein by eating any kind of get that protein by eating any kind of get that protein by eating any kind of food plant or animal because the animal food plant or animal because the animal food plant or animal because the animal you eat or the plant you eat is going to you eat or the plant you eat is going to you eat or the plant you eat is going to have very different protein from yours have very different protein from yours have very different protein from yours but it's going to be made of these same but it's going to be made of these same but it's going to be made of these same amino amino amino acids okay is that making sense Okay cool so let's see see why your proteins cool so let's see see why your proteins are put together the way they are are put together the way they are are put together the way they are they're put together the way they are they're put together the way they are they're put together the way they are for a number of different reasons but for a number of different reasons but for a number of different reasons but the most important is your genes there's the most important is your genes there's the most important is your genes there's also dietary and environmental also dietary and environmental also dietary and environmental influences on which genes get expressed influences on which genes get expressed influences on which genes get expressed which means which proteins are put which means which proteins are put which means which proteins are put together so as I talked about there's together so as I talked about there's together so as I talked about there's hundreds of thousands of aminos in each hundreds of thousands of aminos in each hundreds of thousands of aminos in each of these chains and where do you get of these chains and where do you get of these chains and where do you get these amino acids these amino acids these amino acids from well you get them from your from well you get them from your from well you get them from your food Okay so we do need to eat the amino food Okay so we do need to eat the amino food Okay so we do need to eat the amino acids we don't need to eat the proteins acids we don't need to eat the proteins acids we don't need to eat the proteins so we're starting to get the core of so we're starting to get the core of so we're starting to get the core of what we need to know to make better what we need to know to make better what we need to know to make better decisions to really understand what decisions to really understand what decisions to really understand what protein is and to make better decisions protein is and to make better decisions protein is and to make better decisions about it so where do these amino acids get it so where do these amino acids get made so now we're getting to the really made so now we're getting to the really made so now we're getting to the really fundamental question so you notice I fundamental question so you notice I fundamental question so you notice I have two colors on my little protein have two colors on my little protein have two colors on my little protein chain now there's actually 20 kinds of chain now there's actually 20 kinds of chain now there's actually 20 kinds of amino acids that make up all living amino acids that make up all living amino acids that make up all living things things whether they're plants or things things whether they're plants or things things whether they're plants or animals but for our purposes we can animals but for our purposes we can animals but for our purposes we can divide them into two kinds we don't divide them into two kinds we don't divide them into two kinds we don't we're not biochemist so we don't have to we're not biochemist so we don't have to we're not biochemist so we don't have to sit here and memorize the 20 kinds of sit here and memorize the 20 kinds of sit here and memorize the 20 kinds of amino acids we just need to know that amino acids we just need to know that amino acids we just need to know that some are some are some are non-essential and what is non-essential non-essential and what is non-essential non-essential and what is non-essential mean it means that you can make it mean it means that you can make it mean it means that you can make it yourself since you can make it yourself yourself since you can make it yourself yourself since you can make it yourself you don't need to get it from food you you don't need to get it from food you you don't need to get it from food you don't need to worry about it it's like don't need to worry about it it's like don't need to worry about it it's like anything else your body can make you anything else your body can make you anything else your body can make you just don't worry about it it does it just don't worry about it it does it just don't worry about it it does it without you even having a conscious without you even having a conscious without you even having a conscious thought about it the other amino acids thought about it the other amino acids thought about it the other amino acids are called essential amino acids and are called essential amino acids and are called essential amino acids and that means your body can't make them and that means your body can't make them and that means your body can't make them and that means you have to get them from that means you have to get them from that means you have to get them from food so we only really care about food so we only really care about food so we only really care about getting the essential amino acids so getting the essential amino acids so getting the essential amino acids so imagine in my little protein T that the imagine in my little protein T that the imagine in my little protein T that the amino acids the essential ones are green amino acids the essential ones are green amino acids the essential ones are green and the non-essential are red and you and the non-essential are red and you and the non-essential are red and you notice there's a mix of them that your notice there's a mix of them that your notice there's a mix of them that your body needs so where did the essential body needs so where did the essential body needs so where did the essential amino acid es come from that's probably amino acid es come from that's probably amino acid es come from that's probably the most important question in protein the most important question in protein the most important question in protein nutrition and it turns out again they nutrition and it turns out again they nutrition and it turns out again they are made by plants now why is that it's are made by plants now why is that it's are made by plants now why is that it's because the essential amino acids take a because the essential amino acids take a because the essential amino acids take a lot of metabolic energy they're hard to lot of metabolic energy they're hard to lot of metabolic energy they're hard to put together they take a huge amount of put together they take a huge amount of put together they take a huge amount of energy to put together plants are solar energy to put together plants are solar energy to put together plants are solar powered they're sitting out in the sun powered they're sitting out in the sun powered they're sitting out in the sun they're getting all this wonderful they're getting all this wonderful they're getting all this wonderful energy direct from the Sun and they're energy direct from the Sun and they're energy direct from the Sun and they're converting it they're able to use about converting it they're able to use about converting it they're able to use about 95% of the energy they get and so they 95% of the energy they get and so they 95% of the energy they get and so they have enough energy to make these have enough energy to make these have enough energy to make these essential amino acids animals do not essential amino acids animals do not essential amino acids animals do not have that much metabolic energy right have that much metabolic energy right have that much metabolic energy right they're not solar powered so all these they're not solar powered so all these they're not solar powered so all these essential amino acids come from plants essential amino acids come from plants essential amino acids come from plants every single one of them so what does every single one of them so what does every single one of them so what does that mean it means animal protein is that mean it means animal protein is that mean it means animal protein is nothing but recycled plant protein nothing but recycled plant protein nothing but recycled plant protein there's nothing in animal protein that there's nothing in animal protein that there's nothing in animal protein that is not in plant is not in plant is not in plant protein because the the animals got protein because the the animals got protein because the the animals got their essential amino acids by eating their essential amino acids by eating their essential amino acids by eating the plants remember they can't make the plants remember they can't make the plants remember they can't make them so another way to think of that is them so another way to think of that is them so another way to think of that is to say plants are the base of the food to say plants are the base of the food to say plants are the base of the food chain on planet Earth that means that chain on planet Earth that means that chain on planet Earth that means that plants are nutrient producers are the plants are nutrient producers are the plants are nutrient producers are the base of the food chain they're nutrient base of the food chain they're nutrient base of the food chain they're nutrient producers animals are not the base of producers animals are not the base of producers animals are not the base of the food chain that means animals are the food chain that means animals are the food chain that means animals are nutrient nutrient nutrient consumers very different role that consumers very different role that consumers very different role that Nature's thought for them so let's see Nature's thought for them so let's see Nature's thought for them so let's see another way to look at this another way to look at this another way to look at this so take a good look at this cow I want so take a good look at this cow I want so take a good look at this cow I want everybody to look at the Cow because everybody to look at the Cow because everybody to look at the Cow because this is another way of understanding it this is another way of understanding it this is another way of understanding it and remembering it and if there's one and remembering it and if there's one and remembering it and if there's one thing you remember from tonight I'd like thing you remember from tonight I'd like thing you remember from tonight I'd like you to be this picture of this cow and you to be this picture of this cow and you to be this picture of this cow and remember that this cow is eating remember that this cow is eating remember that this cow is eating essential amino acids this cow is not essential amino acids this cow is not essential amino acids this cow is not making any essential amino making any essential amino making any essential amino acids so if you eat animal products acids so if you eat animal products acids so if you eat animal products whether you choose to eat the cow's milk whether you choose to eat the cow's milk whether you choose to eat the cow's milk you can tell this is a dairy cow or you can tell this is a dairy cow or you can tell this is a dairy cow or whether you choose to eat her muscles or whether you choose to eat her muscles or whether you choose to eat her muscles or her organs or whatever part of her you her organs or whatever part of her you her organs or whatever part of her you eat whatever proteins you're getting eat whatever proteins you're getting eat whatever proteins you're getting from that in fact originally came from from that in fact originally came from from that in fact originally came from the plants that the cow ate at least all the plants that the cow ate at least all the plants that the cow ate at least all the essential amino acids came from the the essential amino acids came from the the essential amino acids came from the plants some of the non-essential ones plants some of the non-essential ones plants some of the non-essential ones the Cal might have made herself but you the Cal might have made herself but you the Cal might have made herself but you don't really need those cuz you can make don't really need those cuz you can make don't really need those cuz you can make them yourself so we're getting close to what yourself so we're getting close to what you need to know about protein to be you need to know about protein to be you need to know about protein to be able to go on and look at how can harm able to go on and look at how can harm able to go on and look at how can harm you uh your body suffers quite a bit you uh your body suffers quite a bit you uh your body suffers quite a bit when you have the wrong kinds of protein when you have the wrong kinds of protein when you have the wrong kinds of protein and too much protein and I'm going to and too much protein and I'm going to and too much protein and I'm going to look at just three ways this can happen look at just three ways this can happen look at just three ways this can happen there's actually more than three but there's actually more than three but there's actually more than three but we'll try to focus on the three main we'll try to focus on the three main we'll try to focus on the three main ones tonight and that should be enough ones tonight and that should be enough ones tonight and that should be enough to get you started so the first danger to get you started so the first danger to get you started so the first danger of protein is that when you have too of protein is that when you have too of protein is that when you have too much of the wrong kinds it can damage much of the wrong kinds it can damage much of the wrong kinds it can damage your liver and kidneys which are clearly your liver and kidneys which are clearly your liver and kidneys which are clearly essential organs an that you need to essential organs an that you need to essential organs an that you need to survive okay you can't live without survive okay you can't live without survive okay you can't live without those organs you actually have two those organs you actually have two those organs you actually have two kidneys and you don't need both of them kidneys and you don't need both of them kidneys and you don't need both of them but you do need enough kidney function but you do need enough kidney function but you do need enough kidney function to be able to clean your blood and get to be able to clean your blood and get to be able to clean your blood and get rid of waste and both these organs can rid of waste and both these organs can rid of waste and both these organs can be damaged and I show picture here this be damaged and I show picture here this be damaged and I show picture here this is actually a kidney because kidney is actually a kidney because kidney is actually a kidney because kidney disease is growing so rapidly and one disease is growing so rapidly and one disease is growing so rapidly and one reason it's growing so rapidly is reason it's growing so rapidly is reason it's growing so rapidly is because of the food we eat so this slide because of the food we eat so this slide because of the food we eat so this slide was actually taken very near here very was actually taken very near here very was actually taken very near here very recently and it's shopping center that's recently and it's shopping center that's recently and it's shopping center that's about 10 11 miles from here and this is about 10 11 miles from here and this is about 10 11 miles from here and this is a directory of the shopping center and a directory of the shopping center and a directory of the shopping center and it shows you all the health services in it shows you all the health services in it shows you all the health services in that shopping center obviously they also that shopping center obviously they also that shopping center obviously they also have categories for restaurants and have categories for restaurants and have categories for restaurants and clothes and knickknacks and things like clothes and knickknacks and things like clothes and knickknacks and things like that this just shows you the health that this just shows you the health that this just shows you the health services and what are you seeing you're services and what are you seeing you're services and what are you seeing you're seeing you know you have the things you seeing you know you have the things you seeing you know you have the things you would expect to see you would expect to would expect to see you would expect to would expect to see you would expect to see in any well equipped shopping center see in any well equipped shopping center see in any well equipped shopping center some kind of Fitness services and some kind of Fitness services and some kind of Fitness services and massage and yoga and exercise weight massage and yoga and exercise weight massage and yoga and exercise weight loss nails and all that kind of stuff loss nails and all that kind of stuff loss nails and all that kind of stuff but now you have a dialysis clinic you but now you have a dialysis clinic you but now you have a dialysis clinic you have a dialysis clinic in the shopping have a dialysis clinic in the shopping have a dialysis clinic in the shopping center you're going to be seeing a lot center you're going to be seeing a lot center you're going to be seeing a lot more of this because this is a real more of this because this is a real more of this because this is a real growth growth growth industry and there are Financial industry and there are Financial industry and there are Financial analysts who are telling you to go out analysts who are telling you to go out analysts who are telling you to go out and buy stock and dialysis center and buy stock and dialysis center and buy stock and dialysis center companies because kidney failure and companies because kidney failure and companies because kidney failure and Stage renal disease is such a rapidly Stage renal disease is such a rapidly Stage renal disease is such a rapidly growing growing growing diagnosis and you know let's see how diagnosis and you know let's see how diagnosis and you know let's see how this relates to this relates to this relates to protein so too much protein is a waste protein so too much protein is a waste protein so too much protein is a waste disposal disposal disposal process so here's the thing about amino process so here's the thing about amino process so here's the thing about amino acids too much protein equals too many acids too much protein equals too many acids too much protein equals too many amino acids because we already talked amino acids because we already talked amino acids because we already talked about what protein is so your body has about what protein is so your body has about what protein is so your body has to get rid of this protein everything to get rid of this protein everything to get rid of this protein everything you eat either you cannot absorb but if you eat either you cannot absorb but if you eat either you cannot absorb but if you absorb it then your body has to you absorb it then your body has to you absorb it then your body has to either use it or get rid of it and either use it or get rid of it and either use it or get rid of it and people don't think of this when they're people don't think of this when they're people don't think of this when they're taking large amounts of supplements or taking large amounts of supplements or taking large amounts of supplements or whatever but when you take too much it's whatever but when you take too much it's whatever but when you take too much it's nothing but a toxic waste disposal nothing but a toxic waste disposal nothing but a toxic waste disposal problem for your body and that's problem for your body and that's problem for your body and that's certainly true of protein as much as certainly true of protein as much as certainly true of protein as much as anything else because you have very anything else because you have very anything else because you have very limited room to store amino acids in limited room to store amino acids in limited room to store amino acids in your body the amount of room you have to your body the amount of room you have to your body the amount of room you have to store amino acids is actually largely store amino acids is actually largely store amino acids is actually largely dependent on your height it has dependent on your height it has dependent on your height it has virtually nothing to do with your diet virtually nothing to do with your diet virtually nothing to do with your diet taller people have a little more room taller people have a little more room taller people have a little more room and that makes sense cuz they have a and that makes sense cuz they have a and that makes sense cuz they have a little more body mass to support for the little more body mass to support for the little more body mass to support for the most part but it really you can't most part but it really you can't most part but it really you can't increase the amount of protein or amino increase the amount of protein or amino increase the amount of protein or amino acids your body stores by eating them acids your body stores by eating them acids your body stores by eating them and the other thing about protein is and the other thing about protein is and the other thing about protein is your body can't just burn it your body can't just burn it your body can't just burn it away and it can't store it in the form away and it can't store it in the form away and it can't store it in the form of protein and it can't burn it for fuel of protein and it can't burn it for fuel of protein and it can't burn it for fuel in the form of protein so how is it in the form of protein so how is it in the form of protein so how is it going to get rid of it it's like this going to get rid of it it's like this going to get rid of it it's like this overflowing trash can it's like you have overflowing trash can it's like you have overflowing trash can it's like you have your overflowing trash can there's been your overflowing trash can there's been your overflowing trash can there's been a strike nobody came to collect your a strike nobody came to collect your a strike nobody came to collect your trash and now you had a big party and trash and now you had a big party and trash and now you had a big party and you just don't even know where to put you just don't even know where to put you just don't even know where to put all this trash so that's kind of like all this trash so that's kind of like all this trash so that's kind of like the situation your body's in when you're the situation your body's in when you're the situation your body's in when you're getting too much protein and it makes getting too much protein and it makes getting too much protein and it makes your liver and kidneys work over time to your liver and kidneys work over time to your liver and kidneys work over time to get rid of it what happens to it well get rid of it what happens to it well get rid of it what happens to it well let's see and then you'll understand why let's see and then you'll understand why let's see and then you'll understand why this is so harmful now the first thing we have to harmful now the first thing we have to look at is what you can use and what you look at is what you can use and what you look at is what you can use and what you can save for fuel and that will really can save for fuel and that will really can save for fuel and that will really explain what happens to your protein so explain what happens to your protein so explain what happens to your protein so the first picture you see here is the first picture you see here is the first picture you see here is glucose and this is in a pure form glucose and this is in a pure form glucose and this is in a pure form usually when you eat food you're not usually when you eat food you're not usually when you eat food you're not eating glucose in a pure form glucose is eating glucose in a pure form glucose is eating glucose in a pure form glucose is one kind of sugar and there's multiple one kind of sugar and there's multiple one kind of sugar and there's multiple kinds of sugar again we don't have to kinds of sugar again we don't have to kinds of sugar again we don't have to worry about that cuz we're not doing worry about that cuz we're not doing worry about that cuz we're not doing biochemistry tonight but glucose is a biochemistry tonight but glucose is a biochemistry tonight but glucose is a form of sugar that your body prefers to form of sugar that your body prefers to form of sugar that your body prefers to burn as fuel and in fact it's the only burn as fuel and in fact it's the only burn as fuel and in fact it's the only fuel that your red blood cells can burn fuel that your red blood cells can burn fuel that your red blood cells can burn so your red blood cells which are so your red blood cells which are so your red blood cells which are necessary to carry oxygen cannot live necessary to carry oxygen cannot live necessary to carry oxygen cannot live without glucose your brain also has an without glucose your brain also has an without glucose your brain also has an extremely strong preference for glucose extremely strong preference for glucose extremely strong preference for glucose if it's really deprived of glucose if it's really deprived of glucose if it's really deprived of glucose there's some other kinds of fuel it can there's some other kinds of fuel it can there's some other kinds of fuel it can burn to limit extent but it won't be burn to limit extent but it won't be burn to limit extent but it won't be working very efficiently or effectively working very efficiently or effectively working very efficiently or effectively and it always does need some and it always does need some and it always does need some glucose so your body without enough glucose so your body without enough glucose so your body without enough glucose is like a city with the power glucose is like a city with the power glucose is like a city with the power outage like nothing happens it's the outage like nothing happens it's the outage like nothing happens it's the end and then the other nutrient your end and then the other nutrient your end and then the other nutrient your body knows what to do with and here I'm body knows what to do with and here I'm body knows what to do with and here I'm talking about macronutrients are sources talking about macronutrients are sources talking about macronutrients are sources of calories because remember proteins a of calories because remember proteins a of calories because remember proteins a source of calories so we've got the source of calories so we've got the source of calories so we've got the sugar and then the other thing we have sugar and then the other thing we have sugar and then the other thing we have is the fat now I'm not showing you this is the fat now I'm not showing you this is the fat now I'm not showing you this because I recommend you eat it I'm because I recommend you eat it I'm because I recommend you eat it I'm showing it to you so you understand that showing it to you so you understand that showing it to you so you understand that your body can store fat which probably your body can store fat which probably your body can store fat which probably we all know and your body can store we all know and your body can store we all know and your body can store actually hundreds and hundreds of pounds actually hundreds and hundreds of pounds actually hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat probably a lot more fat than any of fat probably a lot more fat than any of fat probably a lot more fat than any of us wanted to store right but you know of us wanted to store right but you know of us wanted to store right but you know so all these products you see in this so all these products you see in this so all these products you see in this picture are pure fat and your body knows picture are pure fat and your body knows picture are pure fat and your body knows what to do with it so again your body what to do with it so again your body what to do with it so again your body knows what to do with the glucose your knows what to do with the glucose your knows what to do with the glucose your body knows what to do with the fat and body knows what to do with the fat and body knows what to do with the fat and it can handle it but what about the it can handle it but what about the it can handle it but what about the protein and by the way I just told you protein and by the way I just told you protein and by the way I just told you proteins macronutrient which means it's proteins macronutrient which means it's proteins macronutrient which means it's a source of calories but I also told you a source of calories but I also told you a source of calories but I also told you your body can't burn protein so aren't I your body can't burn protein so aren't I your body can't burn protein so aren't I contradicting myself well let's see now here we're getting into a little see now here we're getting into a little bit of chemistry light don't be afraid bit of chemistry light don't be afraid bit of chemistry light don't be afraid of this if you didn't much like of this if you didn't much like of this if you didn't much like chemistry this is going to be very light chemistry this is going to be very light chemistry this is going to be very light chemistry and I'm very confident you'll chemistry and I'm very confident you'll chemistry and I'm very confident you'll all understand it so when we look at the all understand it so when we look at the all understand it so when we look at the amino acids you'll see you'll understand amino acids you'll see you'll understand amino acids you'll see you'll understand all this and you'll be able to see why all this and you'll be able to see why all this and you'll be able to see why the protein so harmful and why you're the protein so harmful and why you're the protein so harmful and why you're really wasting your money when you have really wasting your money when you have really wasting your money when you have too much of it if you're spending a lot too much of it if you're spending a lot too much of it if you're spending a lot of money for it so the first thing we're of money for it so the first thing we're of money for it so the first thing we're looking at here the thing in the upper looking at here the thing in the upper looking at here the thing in the upper left corner is actually an amino acid left corner is actually an amino acid left corner is actually an amino acid it's a representation of an amino acid it's a representation of an amino acid it's a representation of an amino acid and you can see the amino acids made and you can see the amino acids made and you can see the amino acids made from four from four from four substances there's the oxygen the carbon substances there's the oxygen the carbon substances there's the oxygen the carbon the hydrogen and the nitrogen okay the hydrogen and the nitrogen okay the hydrogen and the nitrogen okay that's what's making the amino acid now that's what's making the amino acid now that's what's making the amino acid now the thing that's special about the amino the thing that's special about the amino the thing that's special about the amino acid that differentiates from the other acid that differentiates from the other acid that differentiates from the other macronutrients is a nitrogen macronutrients is a nitrogen macronutrients is a nitrogen so your body doesn't want the nitrogen so your body doesn't want the nitrogen so your body doesn't want the nitrogen it can't really do much with the it can't really do much with the it can't really do much with the nitrogen so it just it just kind of nitrogen so it just it just kind of nitrogen so it just it just kind of chops it off okay so just think of it it chops it off okay so just think of it it chops it off okay so just think of it it kind of cuts the nitrogen off and we'll kind of cuts the nitrogen off and we'll kind of cuts the nitrogen off and we'll get to what it does to the nitrogen in a get to what it does to the nitrogen in a get to what it does to the nitrogen in a minute but the other three that are left minute but the other three that are left minute but the other three that are left which is the oxygen the carbon and the which is the oxygen the carbon and the which is the oxygen the carbon and the hydrogen your body knows exactly what to hydrogen your body knows exactly what to hydrogen your body knows exactly what to do with because think carbon oxygen do with because think carbon oxygen do with because think carbon oxygen hydrogen what does that sound hydrogen what does that sound hydrogen what does that sound like sounds like carbohydrates does is like sounds like carbohydrates does is like sounds like carbohydrates does is it very well- named macronutrient so if it very well- named macronutrient so if it very well- named macronutrient so if you're and glucose is one kind of you're and glucose is one kind of you're and glucose is one kind of carbohydrate it's a simple carbohydrate carbohydrate it's a simple carbohydrate carbohydrate it's a simple carbohydrate as we all know there's many simple as we all know there's many simple as we all know there's many simple carbohydrates and a lot more even carbohydrates and a lot more even carbohydrates and a lot more even complex complex complex carbohydrates so your body breaks down carbohydrates so your body breaks down carbohydrates so your body breaks down to the simple carbohydrates to burn for to the simple carbohydrates to burn for to the simple carbohydrates to burn for fuel which includes the glucose which is fuel which includes the glucose which is fuel which includes the glucose which is its preferred its preferred its preferred fuel so it takes this carbon oxygen and fuel so it takes this carbon oxygen and fuel so it takes this carbon oxygen and hydrogen if you're low on glucose hydrogen if you're low on glucose hydrogen if you're low on glucose because remember if you're low on because remember if you're low on because remember if you're low on glucose your survival is in danger and glucose your survival is in danger and glucose your survival is in danger and your body is way too smart to let you your body is way too smart to let you your body is way too smart to let you die because you don't have enough die because you don't have enough die because you don't have enough glucose it knows exactly what to do it's glucose it knows exactly what to do it's glucose it knows exactly what to do it's going to make more and that process is going to make more and that process is going to make more and that process is called glucon called glucon called glucon neogenesis and that's really not very neogenesis and that's really not very neogenesis and that's really not very hard to remember because it's gluco for hard to remember because it's gluco for hard to remember because it's gluco for glucose and then Neo means new and glucose and then Neo means new and glucose and then Neo means new and Genesis means make it so it just means Genesis means make it so it just means Genesis means make it so it just means you're kind of making new glucose that's you're kind of making new glucose that's you're kind of making new glucose that's all it means but that's kind of the all it means but that's kind of the all it means but that's kind of the scientific technical term is glucose scientific technical term is glucose scientific technical term is glucose neogenesis now what if you don't need neogenesis now what if you don't need neogenesis now what if you don't need glucose what if you've been needing glucose what if you've been needing glucose what if you've been needing adequate carbohydrates and your body adequate carbohydrates and your body adequate carbohydrates and your body also can store some very very limited also can store some very very limited also can store some very very limited amounts of glucose that'll last it about amounts of glucose that'll last it about amounts of glucose that'll last it about 20 minutes if you're 20 minutes if you're 20 minutes if you're exercising what if you already have all exercising what if you already have all exercising what if you already have all that you need and your body can't store that you need and your body can't store that you need and your body can't store any more glucose well then it takes any more glucose well then it takes any more glucose well then it takes these same elements and it just puts these same elements and it just puts these same elements and it just puts them together in a different way and it them together in a different way and it them together in a different way and it makes it into fat well it knows what to makes it into fat well it knows what to makes it into fat well it knows what to do with fat just stores it in case do with fat just stores it in case do with fat just stores it in case there's a famine next year and you'll there's a famine next year and you'll there's a famine next year and you'll make sure you'll have some calories to make sure you'll have some calories to make sure you'll have some calories to burn so that's what happens to that your burn so that's what happens to that your burn so that's what happens to that your body knows right what to do with it it's body knows right what to do with it it's body knows right what to do with it it's not really dangerous to you because not really dangerous to you because not really dangerous to you because those aren't really dangerous elements those aren't really dangerous elements those aren't really dangerous elements to have in your body but let's look at to have in your body but let's look at to have in your body but let's look at the nitrogen let's look what happens to the nitrogen let's look what happens to the nitrogen let's look what happens to the nitrogen and this is getting to the the nitrogen and this is getting to the the nitrogen and this is getting to the core of why you don't want to eat too core of why you don't want to eat too core of why you don't want to eat too much protein it's because of the nitrogen so the body has to get rid of nitrogen so the body has to get rid of the nitrogen it can't really do anything the nitrogen it can't really do anything the nitrogen it can't really do anything with it like it can with the other three with it like it can with the other three with it like it can with the other three elements so the nitrogen is going to elements so the nitrogen is going to elements so the nitrogen is going to react and the first part of this takes react and the first part of this takes react and the first part of this takes place in the liver and the second part place in the liver and the second part place in the liver and the second part takes place in your kidneys why which is takes place in your kidneys why which is takes place in your kidneys why which is why this process is very hard on those why this process is very hard on those why this process is very hard on those two two two organs so the nitrogen first thing that organs so the nitrogen first thing that organs so the nitrogen first thing that happens to it is it becomes happens to it is it becomes happens to it is it becomes ammonia now do we really want to drink ammonia now do we really want to drink ammonia now do we really want to drink ammonia have ammonia inside our bodies ammonia have ammonia inside our bodies ammonia have ammonia inside our bodies probably not ammonia is actually very probably not ammonia is actually very probably not ammonia is actually very toxic it's very poisonous I think toxic it's very poisonous I think toxic it's very poisonous I think everybody knows that and so you have everybody knows that and so you have everybody knows that and so you have this ammonia flood in your liver well this ammonia flood in your liver well this ammonia flood in your liver well would immediately kill your liver and would immediately kill your liver and would immediately kill your liver and you know you just can't have that in you know you just can't have that in you know you just can't have that in your body it has to be deactivated your body it has to be deactivated your body it has to be deactivated immediately which your body does in kind immediately which your body does in kind immediately which your body does in kind of a split second by going through a of a split second by going through a of a split second by going through a very complex cycle it's a complex cycle very complex cycle it's a complex cycle very complex cycle it's a complex cycle but it happens very quickly and it turns but it happens very quickly and it turns but it happens very quickly and it turns it into a far less dangerous substance it into a far less dangerous substance it into a far less dangerous substance it's called UA now again remember this it's called UA now again remember this it's called UA now again remember this all happens in your liver that the all happens in your liver that the all happens in your liver that the amonia turns into the Ura there's amonia turns into the Ura there's amonia turns into the Ura there's actually a a very small percent of actually a a very small percent of actually a a very small percent of babies born it's like and every 30,000 babies born it's like and every 30,000 babies born it's like and every 30,000 babies born that lacks the enzymes to babies born that lacks the enzymes to babies born that lacks the enzymes to make this urious cycle work which means make this urious cycle work which means make this urious cycle work which means the ammonia would basically kill the the ammonia would basically kill the the ammonia would basically kill the baby in a very short space of time if baby in a very short space of time if baby in a very short space of time if this is discovered this is discovered this is discovered early the baby can be saved by putting early the baby can be saved by putting early the baby can be saved by putting on an ultra low calorie diet an ultra on an ultra low calorie diet an ultra on an ultra low calorie diet an ultra low protein diet rather and then the low protein diet rather and then the low protein diet rather and then the baby's fine if it as long as it eats baby's fine if it as long as it eats baby's fine if it as long as it eats this ultra low protein diet it does the this ultra low protein diet it does the this ultra low protein diet it does the fats that actually you know the child fats that actually you know the child fats that actually you know the child has to be very careful and then the has to be very careful and then the has to be very careful and then the adult but it can Sur adult but it can Sur adult but it can Sur survive so that's how important this survive so that's how important this survive so that's how important this cycle is okay now what happens to the cycle is okay now what happens to the cycle is okay now what happens to the Yuri you don't want this building up in Yuri you don't want this building up in Yuri you don't want this building up in your blood either so it circulates your blood either so it circulates your blood either so it circulates through your blood and when it gets to through your blood and when it gets to through your blood and when it gets to your kidneys your kidneys filter it out your kidneys your kidneys filter it out your kidneys your kidneys filter it out and guess what it does with the Uria it and guess what it does with the Uria it and guess what it does with the Uria it goes into your urine that's why urine is goes into your urine that's why urine is goes into your urine that's why urine is called urine it's from Uria okay so then called urine it's from Uria okay so then called urine it's from Uria okay so then it gets excreted well when there's too it gets excreted well when there's too it gets excreted well when there's too much of it and your kidney has to be much of it and your kidney has to be much of it and your kidney has to be working over time to filter all this working over time to filter all this working over time to filter all this excess Uria which it does if you're excess Uria which it does if you're excess Uria which it does if you're eating too much protein then that is eating too much protein then that is eating too much protein then that is very hard on your kidneys and in fact very hard on your kidneys and in fact very hard on your kidneys and in fact people that have kidney disease have to people that have kidney disease have to people that have kidney disease have to eat a very low protein diet as do people eat a very low protein diet as do people eat a very low protein diet as do people who have serious liver disease because who have serious liver disease because who have serious liver disease because processing the Protein that's we is very processing the Protein that's we is very processing the Protein that's we is very hard on those organs but why wait till hard on those organs but why wait till hard on those organs but why wait till you have that problem why wait until you you have that problem why wait until you you have that problem why wait until you have endstage kidney disease before you have endstage kidney disease before you have endstage kidney disease before you cut down to an appropriate amount of cut down to an appropriate amount of cut down to an appropriate amount of protein why don't you do it beforehand protein why don't you do it beforehand protein why don't you do it beforehand so you don't get endstage kidney disease so you don't get endstage kidney disease so you don't get endstage kidney disease so you don't end up in that dialysis so you don't end up in that dialysis so you don't end up in that dialysis clinic in your nearest shopping center clinic in your nearest shopping center clinic in your nearest shopping center okay so that is pretty much the first okay so that is pretty much the first okay so that is pretty much the first danger of eating protein that we've just danger of eating protein that we've just danger of eating protein that we've just gone over is the harm pure liver and gone over is the harm pure liver and gone over is the harm pure liver and kidneys but there's more so let's look kidneys but there's more so let's look kidneys but there's more so let's look at protein danger number two which is at protein danger number two which is at protein danger number two which is the excess protein makes your cancer the excess protein makes your cancer the excess protein makes your cancer grow faster if you have cancer cells in grow faster if you have cancer cells in grow faster if you have cancer cells in your body Pro excess protein is not a your body Pro excess protein is not a your body Pro excess protein is not a good thing it's going to make them good thing it's going to make them good thing it's going to make them Thrive so let's look at why that Thrive so let's look at why that Thrive so let's look at why that is well there's multiple reasons there's is well there's multiple reasons there's is well there's multiple reasons there's not just one mechanism but this is one not just one mechanism but this is one not just one mechanism but this is one of the most important mechanisms of why of the most important mechanisms of why of the most important mechanisms of why protein makes cancer Thrive and that is protein makes cancer Thrive and that is protein makes cancer Thrive and that is production of a hormone called insulin production of a hormone called insulin production of a hormone called insulin like growth factor one or igf1 for short like growth factor one or igf1 for short like growth factor one or igf1 for short now igf-1 is an essential hormone it now igf-1 is an essential hormone it now igf-1 is an essential hormone it regulates a lot of your body metabolism regulates a lot of your body metabolism regulates a lot of your body metabolism your growth at the stage of your uh life your growth at the stage of your uh life your growth at the stage of your uh life cycle when you're still growing in cycle when you're still growing in cycle when you're still growing in childhood and when you're a teenager it childhood and when you're a teenager it childhood and when you're a teenager it regulates cell division cell death and regulates cell division cell death and regulates cell division cell death and all those things things and certain all those things things and certain all those things things and certain proteins in diet will raise igf-1 levels proteins in diet will raise igf-1 levels proteins in diet will raise igf-1 levels and the Protein that's most strongly and the Protein that's most strongly and the Protein that's most strongly implicated in that is actually Dairy implicated in that is actually Dairy implicated in that is actually Dairy protein so dairy foods are the ones that protein so dairy foods are the ones that protein so dairy foods are the ones that will make the igf sore to the highest will make the igf sore to the highest will make the igf sore to the highest level and that makes sense because level and that makes sense because level and that makes sense because there's actually idf1 in dairy products there's actually idf1 in dairy products there's actually idf1 in dairy products because remember it's produced by the because remember it's produced by the because remember it's produced by the mom cow for her calf was a little tiny mom cow for her calf was a little tiny mom cow for her calf was a little tiny thing that she wants to grow up drinking thing that she wants to grow up drinking thing that she wants to grow up drinking her milk so she's going to nurse a calf her milk so she's going to nurse a calf her milk so she's going to nurse a calf to grow but unfortunately you're not a to grow but unfortunately you're not a to grow but unfortunately you're not a little calf so when you consume it little calf so when you consume it little calf so when you consume it you're getting all this growth factor you're getting all this growth factor you're getting all this growth factor but you don't need it and it's extremely dangerous so how does it stimulate dangerous so how does it stimulate cancer cell growth well there's a few cancer cell growth well there's a few cancer cell growth well there's a few ways one is that the growth hormone ways one is that the growth hormone ways one is that the growth hormone itself because it's stimulating cell itself because it's stimulating cell itself because it's stimulating cell division is making the cancer cells division is making the cancer cells division is making the cancer cells divide faster and by the way cancer divide faster and by the way cancer divide faster and by the way cancer cells appear to be more susceptible to cells appear to be more susceptible to cells appear to be more susceptible to the effect idf1 the normal cells are so the effect idf1 the normal cells are so the effect idf1 the normal cells are so they are going to start dividing faster they are going to start dividing faster they are going to start dividing faster than they otherwise would than they otherwise would than they otherwise would have there's another mechanism which is have there's another mechanism which is have there's another mechanism which is that there's something called normal that there's something called normal that there's something called normal cell death and this is actually a normal cell death and this is actually a normal cell death and this is actually a normal programm part of you that if you have a programm part of you that if you have a programm part of you that if you have a diseased or damaged cell or a cell diseased or damaged cell or a cell diseased or damaged cell or a cell that's become nonfunctional it's that's become nonfunctional it's that's become nonfunctional it's supposed to self-destruct that's how supposed to self-destruct that's how supposed to self-destruct that's how your body's programmed it's actually your body's programmed it's actually your body's programmed it's actually very important it does that well cancer very important it does that well cancer very important it does that well cancer cells usually won't self-destruct but if cells usually won't self-destruct but if cells usually won't self-destruct but if there's not too much igf1 they will so there's not too much igf1 they will so there's not too much igf1 they will so this normal self-destructive process is this normal self-destructive process is this normal self-destructive process is basically deactivated by the excess basically deactivated by the excess basically deactivated by the excess igf-1 and then another thing because the igf-1 and then another thing because the igf-1 and then another thing because the igf-1 is fueling growth is it's fueling igf-1 is fueling growth is it's fueling igf-1 is fueling growth is it's fueling the blood vessels that nourish the tumor the blood vessels that nourish the tumor the blood vessels that nourish the tumor if you have a tumor you know tumors grow if you have a tumor you know tumors grow if you have a tumor you know tumors grow when they're nourished by excess blood when they're nourished by excess blood when they're nourished by excess blood vessels and there's a lot of cancer vessels and there's a lot of cancer vessels and there's a lot of cancer drugs now that are coming out that work drugs now that are coming out that work drugs now that are coming out that work by keeping these blood vessels from by keeping these blood vessels from by keeping these blood vessels from growing to you know the tumors so you growing to you know the tumors so you growing to you know the tumors so you can actually have a lot of that same can actually have a lot of that same can actually have a lot of that same effect just by not having the igf1 from effect just by not having the igf1 from effect just by not having the igf1 from all these excess animal Foods now all these excess animal Foods now all these excess animal Foods now there's one more thing I want to mention there's one more thing I want to mention there's one more thing I want to mention about protein and the level of igf1 about protein and the level of igf1 about protein and the level of igf1 we've talked about Dairy protein is the we've talked about Dairy protein is the we've talked about Dairy protein is the worst other animal proteins are very bad worst other animal proteins are very bad worst other animal proteins are very bad too it appears that highly concentrated too it appears that highly concentrated too it appears that highly concentrated plant proteins and here I'm not talking plant proteins and here I'm not talking plant proteins and here I'm not talking about Whole Foods but things like soy about Whole Foods but things like soy about Whole Foods but things like soy protein powders and this has not been protein powders and this has not been protein powders and this has not been studies that extensively as the animal studies that extensively as the animal studies that extensively as the animal foods but they also cause levels of igf1 foods but they also cause levels of igf1 foods but they also cause levels of igf1 to go up because remember the function to go up because remember the function to go up because remember the function of protein is to facilitate growth of protein is to facilitate growth of protein is to facilitate growth that's one of its functions so the the that's one of its functions so the the that's one of its functions so the the plan it's been studying most for is soy plan it's been studying most for is soy plan it's been studying most for is soy the isolated soy protein pows this has the isolated soy protein pows this has the isolated soy protein pows this has nothing to do with whole soy I don't nothing to do with whole soy I don't nothing to do with whole soy I don't want anybody in this room to want anybody in this room to want anybody in this room to misunderstand and say I'm not going to misunderstand and say I'm not going to misunderstand and say I'm not going to eat atam momy I'm not going to eat tofu eat atam momy I'm not going to eat tofu eat atam momy I'm not going to eat tofu I'm not going to eat Tempe or soy yogurt I'm not going to eat Tempe or soy yogurt I'm not going to eat Tempe or soy yogurt it has nothing to do with those those it has nothing to do with those those it has nothing to do with those those are not highly processed foods it has to are not highly processed foods it has to are not highly processed foods it has to do with the kind of protein that's been do with the kind of protein that's been do with the kind of protein that's been extracted from the soybean and basically extracted from the soybean and basically extracted from the soybean and basically get sold as a white powder that you can get sold as a white powder that you can get sold as a white powder that you can buy and just eat to excess or that gets buy and just eat to excess or that gets buy and just eat to excess or that gets used to make zhein gets used to make used to make zhein gets used to make used to make zhein gets used to make imitation meats or something like that imitation meats or something like that imitation meats or something like that so you want to avoid these concentrated so you want to avoid these concentrated so you want to avoid these concentrated protein powders even if they're from protein powders even if they're from protein powders even if they're from plants so remember we saw the nutrition plants so remember we saw the nutrition plants so remember we saw the nutrition aisle you know you you want to be aisle you know you you want to be aisle you know you you want to be healthy you want to kind of just stay healthy you want to kind of just stay healthy you want to kind of just stay off that aisle soy milk is fine someone off that aisle soy milk is fine someone off that aisle soy milk is fine someone asked about soy milk soy milk is fine asked about soy milk soy milk is fine asked about soy milk soy milk is fine that's also not highly processed the that's also not highly processed the that's also not highly processed the point is soy milk things like that are point is soy milk things like that are point is soy milk things like that are not highly processed what I'm talking not highly processed what I'm talking not highly processed what I'm talking about are things it's actually a powder about are things it's actually a powder about are things it's actually a powder that you buy in a jug that's made in a that you buy in a jug that's made in a that you buy in a jug that's made in a factory so let's get on to the third factory so let's get on to the third factory so let's get on to the third mechanism by which too much protein of mechanism by which too much protein of mechanism by which too much protein of the wrong kind can harm you and that is the wrong kind can harm you and that is the wrong kind can harm you and that is the protein can cause the protein can cause the protein can cause inflammation throughout your body so inflammation throughout your body so inflammation throughout your body so let's see why that's let's see why that's let's see why that's important important important well inflammation is a natural process well inflammation is a natural process well inflammation is a natural process it's very protective it's a function it's very protective it's a function it's very protective it's a function mostly of your immune system but also of mostly of your immune system but also of mostly of your immune system but also of your nervous system you have to have your nervous system you have to have your nervous system you have to have inflammation to protect you from things inflammation to protect you from things inflammation to protect you from things like microbes and injury to heal after like microbes and injury to heal after like microbes and injury to heal after say you burn yourself or scrape yourself say you burn yourself or scrape yourself say you burn yourself or scrape yourself or cut yourself or anything like that or cut yourself or anything like that or cut yourself or anything like that you have to have inflammation to help you have to have inflammation to help you have to have inflammation to help you heal and that's all your immune you heal and that's all your immune you heal and that's all your immune system protecting system protecting system protecting you but some proteins cause excess you but some proteins cause excess you but some proteins cause excess inflammation now remember your immune inflammation now remember your immune inflammation now remember your immune system protecting you what's it system protecting you what's it system protecting you what's it protecting you from it's protecting you protecting you from it's protecting you protecting you from it's protecting you from things that could hurt from things that could hurt from things that could hurt you now remember we talked about our you now remember we talked about our you now remember we talked about our chain our protein chain and the ideal is chain our protein chain and the ideal is chain our protein chain and the ideal is that when you digest a protein that when you digest a protein that when you digest a protein chain you break it into all these amino chain you break it into all these amino chain you break it into all these amino acids the amino acids are absorbed and acids the amino acids are absorbed and acids the amino acids are absorbed and they're no longer protein so they're not they're no longer protein so they're not they're no longer protein so they're not going to incite your immune system they going to incite your immune system they going to incite your immune system they will inight your liver and kidneys as we will inight your liver and kidneys as we will inight your liver and kidneys as we talked about they won't incite your talked about they won't incite your talked about they won't incite your immune system but here's the thing immune system but here's the thing immune system but here's the thing often times a large part of this chain often times a large part of this chain often times a large part of this chain does not get broken down in the does not get broken down in the does not get broken down in the digestion process because that process digestion process because that process digestion process because that process is about 99% right on but about 1% of is about 99% right on but about 1% of is about 99% right on but about 1% of the time it's incomplete so when you the time it's incomplete so when you the time it's incomplete so when you think of all the proteins you eat about think of all the proteins you eat about think of all the proteins you eat about 1% of the time a large part of the chain 1% of the time a large part of the chain 1% of the time a large part of the chain is going to be absorbed into your body is going to be absorbed into your body is going to be absorbed into your body intact and that becomes a foreign intact and that becomes a foreign intact and that becomes a foreign protein in your body that your immune protein in your body that your immune protein in your body that your immune system can say I don't like this now system can say I don't like this now system can say I don't like this now this happens many times a day so your this happens many times a day so your this happens many times a day so your immune system can't go crazy on every immune system can't go crazy on every immune system can't go crazy on every kind of protein so what kind of protein kind of protein so what kind of protein kind of protein so what kind of protein is it going to be looking out for well is it going to be looking out for well is it going to be looking out for well it's not usually looking out for plant it's not usually looking out for plant it's not usually looking out for plant proteins because plants aren't going to proteins because plants aren't going to proteins because plants aren't going to hurt you remember plants are kind of hurt you remember plants are kind of hurt you remember plants are kind of self-sufficient they're out there we self-sufficient they're out there we self-sufficient they're out there we talked about they're growing in the sun talked about they're growing in the sun talked about they're growing in the sun they're the base of the food chain they they're the base of the food chain they they're the base of the food chain they make or absorb their own nutrients they make or absorb their own nutrients they make or absorb their own nutrients they really don't need you so plants not really don't need you so plants not really don't need you so plants not going to come you know your rose bush going to come you know your rose bush going to come you know your rose bush isn't going to come and invade your body isn't going to come and invade your body isn't going to come and invade your body and take you over and kill you right and take you over and kill you right and take you over and kill you right what it's looking for is foreign animal what it's looking for is foreign animal what it's looking for is foreign animal proteins because animals are nutrient proteins because animals are nutrient proteins because animals are nutrient consumers and some of them might very consumers and some of them might very consumers and some of them might very well want to consume you and that would well want to consume you and that would well want to consume you and that would be things like parasites or microbes be things like parasites or microbes be things like parasites or microbes that are in the animal kingdom that want that are in the animal kingdom that want that are in the animal kingdom that want to consume you so that's what your to consume you so that's what your to consume you so that's what your immune system is on the lookout for and immune system is on the lookout for and immune system is on the lookout for and what it's going to react to with what it's going to react to with what it's going to react to with inflammation now you might be saying inflammation now you might be saying inflammation now you might be saying well inflammation is actually protective well inflammation is actually protective well inflammation is actually protective you just told me inflammation is you just told me inflammation is you just told me inflammation is protective so why should I care about it protective so why should I care about it protective so why should I care about it and the answer is that yes it is and the answer is that yes it is and the answer is that yes it is protective when it's in the acute stage protective when it's in the acute stage protective when it's in the acute stage which is right after you faced a threat which is right after you faced a threat which is right after you faced a threat or let's say right after you cut or let's say right after you cut or let's say right after you cut yourself or right after you've been yourself or right after you've been yourself or right after you've been attacked by some cold viruses or attacked by some cold viruses or attacked by some cold viruses or parasites or something like that but if parasites or something like that but if parasites or something like that but if it goes on and on and on that is it it goes on and on and on that is it it goes on and on and on that is it becomes chronic that's a different story becomes chronic that's a different story becomes chronic that's a different story then it becomes destructive because it then it becomes destructive because it then it becomes destructive because it never has a chance to never has a chance to never has a chance to heal so remember the inflammation starts heal so remember the inflammation starts heal so remember the inflammation starts out protecting you deactivating the out protecting you deactivating the out protecting you deactivating the Invader very aggressively and then it Invader very aggressively and then it Invader very aggressively and then it helps you to heal helps you to heal helps you to heal well when you have chronic inflammation well when you have chronic inflammation well when you have chronic inflammation you never get into that healing phase you never get into that healing phase you never get into that healing phase because it's as if you had a scrape if because it's as if you had a scrape if because it's as if you had a scrape if you had a scrape after a few days it you had a scrape after a few days it you had a scrape after a few days it would start to heal but if you got a would start to heal but if you got a would start to heal but if you got a scrape and every single day you took scrape and every single day you took scrape and every single day you took some steel wool and you kept scraping some steel wool and you kept scraping some steel wool and you kept scraping and scrape and scraping it and scraping and scrape and scraping it and scraping and scrape and scraping it and scraping and scraping it would never heal right and scraping it would never heal right and scraping it would never heal right because you'd be irritating it every day because you'd be irritating it every day because you'd be irritating it every day and that's the same thing when you're and that's the same thing when you're and that's the same thing when you're eating these foreign proteins that your eating these foreign proteins that your eating these foreign proteins that your body perceives as threats several times body perceives as threats several times body perceives as threats several times a day it causes The Chronic inflam now a day it causes The Chronic inflam now a day it causes The Chronic inflam now again it's not the only thing that again it's not the only thing that again it's not the only thing that causes chronic inflammation it's causes chronic inflammation it's causes chronic inflammation it's something that needs to be really something that needs to be really something that needs to be really studied quite a bit more it's something studied quite a bit more it's something studied quite a bit more it's something that not nearly enough energy has been that not nearly enough energy has been that not nearly enough energy has been devoted to studying because in fact devoted to studying because in fact devoted to studying because in fact chronic inflammation underlies most chronic inflammation underlies most chronic inflammation underlies most chronic disease that includes chronic disease that includes chronic disease that includes hypertension cardiovascular disease hypertension cardiovascular disease hypertension cardiovascular disease autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes you autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes you autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes you know all the common killers and the know all the common killers and the know all the common killers and the things that make you uncomfortable things that make you uncomfortable things that make you uncomfortable things like sinusitis or headaches that things like sinusitis or headaches that things like sinusitis or headaches that aren't necessarily going to kill you but aren't necessarily going to kill you but aren't necessarily going to kill you but they make your life miserable are all they make your life miserable are all they make your life miserable are all examples of chronic examples of chronic examples of chronic inflammation so you really don't want to inflammation so you really don't want to inflammation so you really don't want to be uh fueling this chronic inflammation be uh fueling this chronic inflammation be uh fueling this chronic inflammation you want to be giving your body a break you want to be giving your body a break you want to be giving your body a break so it can heal and the inflammation can so it can heal and the inflammation can so it can heal and the inflammation can go away so that's another reason you go away so that's another reason you go away so that's another reason you don't want to be consuming these don't want to be consuming these don't want to be consuming these proteins again this is something that proteins again this is something that proteins again this is something that there should be a lot more research on there should be a lot more research on there should be a lot more research on there is quite a few studies out that there is quite a few studies out that there is quite a few studies out that look at you know the effect of animal look at you know the effect of animal look at you know the effect of animal foods and processed foods and whole foods and processed foods and whole foods and processed foods and whole plant Foods on inflammation in the body plant Foods on inflammation in the body plant Foods on inflammation in the body using certain markers of using certain markers of using certain markers of inflammation and what they find is that inflammation and what they find is that inflammation and what they find is that animal foods and extremely highly animal foods and extremely highly animal foods and extremely highly processed plant foods do cause more processed plant foods do cause more processed plant foods do cause more inflammation whereas whole plant foods inflammation whereas whole plant foods inflammation whereas whole plant foods cause you to have a balanc inflammatory cause you to have a balanc inflammatory cause you to have a balanc inflammatory state in other words you're in exactly state in other words you're in exactly state in other words you're in exactly the state you should be you don't want the state you should be you don't want the state you should be you don't want to go from one extreme to the other you to go from one extreme to the other you to go from one extreme to the other you don't want to not jump off one cliff and don't want to not jump off one cliff and don't want to not jump off one cliff and run the other way screaming and fall off run the other way screaming and fall off run the other way screaming and fall off the cliff that's a mile down the road so the cliff that's a mile down the road so the cliff that's a mile down the road so you don't want to go from being you don't want to go from being you don't want to go from being pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory you want to be balanced and that's what you want to be balanced and that's what you want to be balanced and that's what Whole Foods help you do so let's look at Whole Foods help you do so let's look at Whole Foods help you do so let's look at what some of these myths are and what what some of these myths are and what what some of these myths are and what you can do to make better choices so the you can do to make better choices so the you can do to make better choices so the first myth is that plants don't have first myth is that plants don't have first myth is that plants don't have enough enough enough protein well we already kind of debunked protein well we already kind of debunked protein well we already kind of debunked this one but I wanted to Circle back to this one but I wanted to Circle back to this one but I wanted to Circle back to it because this one is so important I it because this one is so important I it because this one is so important I think it's very critical to be explicit think it's very critical to be explicit think it's very critical to be explicit with it for you to see that this really with it for you to see that this really with it for you to see that this really is not the case so what did we learn is not the case so what did we learn is not the case so what did we learn about plant protein we learned that about plant protein we learned that about plant protein we learned that plants are the base of the food chain plants are the base of the food chain plants are the base of the food chain and they make all the essential amino and they make all the essential amino and they make all the essential amino acids now these amino acids do get more acids now these amino acids do get more acids now these amino acids do get more concentrated in animal muscle but they concentrated in animal muscle but they concentrated in animal muscle but they get more concentrated than you really get more concentrated than you really get more concentrated than you really need and that can be a source of ill need and that can be a source of ill need and that can be a source of ill health as we just saw the plants have health as we just saw the plants have health as we just saw the plants have plenty of protein why because the plants plenty of protein why because the plants plenty of protein why because the plants need need need protein you know that if you're a protein you know that if you're a protein you know that if you're a gardener if you're a gardener you know gardener if you're a gardener you know gardener if you're a gardener you know your plants need Nitro nitrogen remember your plants need Nitro nitrogen remember your plants need Nitro nitrogen remember we looked at nitrogen as a special we looked at nitrogen as a special we looked at nitrogen as a special element of protein why do you have to element of protein why do you have to element of protein why do you have to give your plants nitrogen fertilizer give your plants nitrogen fertilizer give your plants nitrogen fertilizer it's because the plants are making it's because the plants are making it's because the plants are making protein okay in fact about 30% of the protein okay in fact about 30% of the protein okay in fact about 30% of the dry weight of plant cells is actually dry weight of plant cells is actually dry weight of plant cells is actually protein and it's a living thing of the protein and it's a living thing of the protein and it's a living thing of the plants so this whole idea that plants plants so this whole idea that plants plants so this whole idea that plants don't have enough protein is wrong on don't have enough protein is wrong on don't have enough protein is wrong on any number of any number of any number of counts but there's even another reason counts but there's even another reason counts but there's even another reason why this doesn't make why this doesn't make why this doesn't make sense which is that your body recycles sense which is that your body recycles sense which is that your body recycles amino acids so your body is actually amino acids so your body is actually amino acids so your body is actually very efficient and your body isn't going very efficient and your body isn't going very efficient and your body isn't going to waste anything that it can use or to waste anything that it can use or to waste anything that it can use or reuse so it's kind of like this Fountain reuse so it's kind of like this Fountain reuse so it's kind of like this Fountain this picture is actually a very nice this picture is actually a very nice this picture is actually a very nice fountain in Baba Park in San Diego it's fountain in Baba Park in San Diego it's fountain in Baba Park in San Diego it's one of my favorite one of my favorite one of my favorite fountains and you can see what the fountains and you can see what the fountains and you can see what the fountain is doing the fountain is fountain is doing the fountain is fountain is doing the fountain is spraying water and then what happens to spraying water and then what happens to spraying water and then what happens to the the the water The Fountain reuses the water okay water The Fountain reuses the water okay water The Fountain reuses the water okay so if this Fountain needs 100 gallons of so if this Fountain needs 100 gallons of so if this Fountain needs 100 gallons of water does the city of San Diego need to water does the city of San Diego need to water does the city of San Diego need to put 100 gallons of water in this put 100 gallons of water in this put 100 gallons of water in this Fountain every Fountain every Fountain every day of course not because a fountain is day of course not because a fountain is day of course not because a fountain is just Recycling and Recycling and just Recycling and Recycling and just Recycling and Recycling and recycling the water it needs to put a recycling the water it needs to put a recycling the water it needs to put a tiny bit in eventually because some of tiny bit in eventually because some of tiny bit in eventually because some of the water will evaporate and some might the water will evaporate and some might the water will evaporate and some might Splash out or something like that but Splash out or something like that but Splash out or something like that but basically it just keeps Recycling and basically it just keeps Recycling and basically it just keeps Recycling and recirculating and it's exactly what recirculating and it's exactly what recirculating and it's exactly what happens to your amino acids remember happens to your amino acids remember happens to your amino acids remember they're building they're building they're building blocks they're these little building blocks they're these little building blocks they're these little building blocks blocks blocks so so so you can reuse them again and again and you can reuse them again and again and you can reuse them again and again and again and again and again so that's why again and again and again so that's why again and again and again so that's why you don't need to take in that much you you don't need to take in that much you you don't need to take in that much you know if you weigh 150 lbs you don't need know if you weigh 150 lbs you don't need know if you weigh 150 lbs you don't need to eat 150 lbs of protein every day and to eat 150 lbs of protein every day and to eat 150 lbs of protein every day and actually a lot of that weight is water actually a lot of that weight is water actually a lot of that weight is water and minerals but whatever weight it's and minerals but whatever weight it's and minerals but whatever weight it's protein you don't need to eat that every protein you don't need to eat that every protein you don't need to eat that every day because your body is recycling the day because your body is recycling the day because your body is recycling the aminos and it actually excels best at aminos and it actually excels best at aminos and it actually excels best at conserving the amino acids that are conserving the amino acids that are conserving the amino acids that are least common in Foods so remember we least common in Foods so remember we least common in Foods so remember we talked about we have amino acids storage talked about we have amino acids storage talked about we have amino acids storage pools but they're very small your body pools but they're very small your body pools but they're very small your body will preferentially fill them up with will preferentially fill them up with will preferentially fill them up with the amino acids that are hardest to get the amino acids that are hardest to get the amino acids that are hardest to get from foods and that's one reason you from foods and that's one reason you from foods and that's one reason you don't have to worry about mixing and don't have to worry about mixing and don't have to worry about mixing and matching protein there's that myth that matching protein there's that myth that matching protein there's that myth that you know if you eat plant foods you you know if you eat plant foods you you know if you eat plant foods you should eat beans and rice or that kind should eat beans and rice or that kind should eat beans and rice or that kind of thing because they have complimentary of thing because they have complimentary of thing because they have complimentary you know amino acids that's actually you know amino acids that's actually you know amino acids that's actually totally untrue every plant has all 20 totally untrue every plant has all 20 totally untrue every plant has all 20 amino acids both the essential and the amino acids both the essential and the amino acids both the essential and the non-essential it needs it to live and in non-essential it needs it to live and in non-essential it needs it to live and in fact even if it were true you wouldn't fact even if it were true you wouldn't fact even if it were true you wouldn't have to worry about it because your have to worry about it because your have to worry about it because your body's going to preferentially conserve body's going to preferentially conserve body's going to preferentially conserve the amino acids it has the hardest time the amino acids it has the hardest time the amino acids it has the hardest time getting so let's look at myth number getting so let's look at myth number getting so let's look at myth number two which is the myth that was on the two which is the myth that was on the two which is the myth that was on the USDA plate remember that little graphic USDA plate remember that little graphic USDA plate remember that little graphic I showed you where there was a whole I showed you where there was a whole I showed you where there was a whole quarter of the plate that was devoted to quarter of the plate that was devoted to quarter of the plate that was devoted to protein you're supp of protein on why protein you're supp of protein on why protein you're supp of protein on why know you supposed to put on in a chain know you supposed to put on in a chain know you supposed to put on in a chain like this and eat it I don't know like this and eat it I don't know like this and eat it I don't know they're not very explicit not very much they're not very explicit not very much they're not very explicit not very much help but the point is that plate is help but the point is that plate is help but the point is that plate is extremely misleading because everything extremely misleading because everything extremely misleading because everything on that plate had protein it was made on that plate had protein it was made on that plate had protein it was made from protein we' just been talking about from protein we' just been talking about from protein we' just been talking about that so the vegetables are full of that so the vegetables are full of that so the vegetables are full of protein the fruit actually the food protein the fruit actually the food protein the fruit actually the food that's lowest in protein but still the that's lowest in protein but still the that's lowest in protein but still the live it was a living thing so it has live it was a living thing so it has live it was a living thing so it has protein and the whole grains are very protein and the whole grains are very protein and the whole grains are very high in high in high in protein so you don't need a special protein so you don't need a special protein so you don't need a special source of protein because every single source of protein because every single source of protein because every single solitary thing on the plate has protein solitary thing on the plate has protein solitary thing on the plate has protein in it and yet you're Tau to look at in it and yet you're Tau to look at in it and yet you're Tau to look at protein is kind of like the center of protein is kind of like the center of protein is kind of like the center of the meal it's the most valuable thing the meal it's the most valuable thing the meal it's the most valuable thing it's the thing you Center your whole it's the thing you Center your whole it's the thing you Center your whole meal about is this protein right it's meal about is this protein right it's meal about is this protein right it's just a total just a total just a total myth and the source of protein meth myth and the source of protein meth myth and the source of protein meth causes just absolutely no end of causes just absolutely no end of causes just absolutely no end of Mischief you don't need a special source Mischief you don't need a special source Mischief you don't need a special source of protein in your food any more than of protein in your food any more than of protein in your food any more than you need a special source of oxygen in you need a special source of oxygen in you need a special source of oxygen in your air right you don't need to go to your air right you don't need to go to your air right you don't need to go to one corner the room to get your oxygen one corner the room to get your oxygen one corner the room to get your oxygen because the oxygen is evenly diffused because the oxygen is evenly diffused because the oxygen is evenly diffused throughout the whole room and it's the throughout the whole room and it's the throughout the whole room and it's the same thing with the protein it's same thing with the protein it's same thing with the protein it's diffused throughout everything you eat diffused throughout everything you eat diffused throughout everything you eat therefore you do not need a special therefore you do not need a special therefore you do not need a special source of it okay so there's another source of it okay so there's another source of it okay so there's another very common myth that keeps people just very common myth that keeps people just very common myth that keeps people just glomming down what they see is protein glomming down what they see is protein glomming down what they see is protein protein animal food animal food these protein animal food animal food these protein animal food animal food these days so let's see what that myth is okay days so let's see what that myth is okay days so let's see what that myth is okay so it's a myth that your an ancestors so it's a myth that your an ancestors so it's a myth that your an ancestors ate lots of animal ate lots of animal ate lots of animal protein and therefore you should too protein and therefore you should too protein and therefore you should too because after all you wouldn't want to because after all you wouldn't want to because after all you wouldn't want to do anything different from what your do anything different from what your do anything different from what your ancestors did 2 and a half million years ancestors did 2 and a half million years ancestors did 2 and a half million years ago would ago would ago would you so let's look at this one in a you so let's look at this one in a you so let's look at this one in a little bit more detail this is called little bit more detail this is called little bit more detail this is called the paleo diet the caveman diet it has the paleo diet the caveman diet it has the paleo diet the caveman diet it has some other names so it doesn't really some other names so it doesn't really some other names so it doesn't really matter what it's called basically it's a matter what it's called basically it's a matter what it's called basically it's a diet that tells you to eat lots and lots diet that tells you to eat lots and lots diet that tells you to eat lots and lots and lots of meat not to eat dairy so and lots of meat not to eat dairy so and lots of meat not to eat dairy so you're going to eat meat basically you're going to eat meat basically you're going to eat meat basically fruits and vegetables you're told not to fruits and vegetables you're told not to fruits and vegetables you're told not to eat grain not to eat beans and just to eat grain not to eat beans and just to eat grain not to eat beans and just to eat basically the meats fruits and eat basically the meats fruits and eat basically the meats fruits and vegetables which is supposedly what your vegetables which is supposedly what your vegetables which is supposedly what your ancestors ate 2 and a half million years ancestors ate 2 and a half million years ancestors ate 2 and a half million years ago well that makes it very nice ago well that makes it very nice ago well that makes it very nice appealing story because it sets you up appealing story because it sets you up appealing story because it sets you up to think you can kind of be in to think you can kind of be in to think you can kind of be in communication with your ancestors 2 and communication with your ancestors 2 and communication with your ancestors 2 and a half million years ago just by eating a half million years ago just by eating a half million years ago just by eating the foods they ate but there's a little the foods they ate but there's a little the foods they ate but there's a little problem with this story which is that problem with this story which is that problem with this story which is that it's a total fairy tale and it gets you it's a total fairy tale and it gets you it's a total fairy tale and it gets you eating a dis a disease inducing diet eating a dis a disease inducing diet eating a dis a disease inducing diet that's actually very harmful and I don't that's actually very harmful and I don't that's actually very harmful and I don't have time tonight to go into all the have time tonight to go into all the have time tonight to go into all the aspects of this smth I would be here for aspects of this smth I would be here for aspects of this smth I would be here for over an hour just going over this but over an hour just going over this but over an hour just going over this but let me just hit a few of the highlights let me just hit a few of the highlights let me just hit a few of the highlights so you realize how absolutely ridiculous so you realize how absolutely ridiculous so you realize how absolutely ridiculous this is first off 2 and a half million this is first off 2 and a half million this is first off 2 and a half million years ago your ancestors did not look years ago your ancestors did not look years ago your ancestors did not look anything like what we look like now was anything like what we look like now was anything like what we look like now was a totally different species of hominid a totally different species of hominid a totally different species of hominid than we are now than we are now than we are now so they actually had very thick teeth so they actually had very thick teeth so they actually had very thick teeth and very thick and very thick and very thick jaws and you can actually see this if jaws and you can actually see this if jaws and you can actually see this if you want to look it up on Smithsonian you want to look it up on Smithsonian you want to look it up on Smithsonian website you just can search for they website you just can search for they website you just can search for they have a very nice little family tree of have a very nice little family tree of have a very nice little family tree of how humans evolved and shows you very how humans evolved and shows you very how humans evolved and shows you very nice pictures at each step of the nice pictures at each step of the nice pictures at each step of the way so our ancestors had such thick way so our ancestors had such thick way so our ancestors had such thick teeth and such thick Jaws at that point teeth and such thick Jaws at that point teeth and such thick Jaws at that point that it saw that they actually ate tree that it saw that they actually ate tree that it saw that they actually ate tree bark far from eating meat so here they bark far from eating meat so here they bark far from eating meat so here they are living on the savanas of Africa are living on the savanas of Africa are living on the savanas of Africa where we can see that there's all these where we can see that there's all these where we can see that there's all these large animals and it's hot and there's large animals and it's hot and there's large animals and it's hot and there's not much shade now even the paleo diet not much shade now even the paleo diet not much shade now even the paleo diet proponents say that in fact humans back proponents say that in fact humans back proponents say that in fact humans back then had very primitive tools and they then had very primitive tools and they then had very primitive tools and they would have a very hard time with those would have a very hard time with those would have a very hard time with those extremely primitive tools hunting these extremely primitive tools hunting these extremely primitive tools hunting these animals and killing them so then where animals and killing them so then where animals and killing them so then where were they supposed to get all this were they supposed to get all this were they supposed to get all this meat well the the answer that is given meat well the the answer that is given meat well the the answer that is given by these kind of diets is they got it by by these kind of diets is they got it by by these kind of diets is they got it by eating the kill of large Carnival for eating the kill of large Carnival for eating the kill of large Carnival for it's not too likely that a ban of it's not too likely that a ban of it's not too likely that a ban of cavemen were going to come along and cavemen were going to come along and cavemen were going to come along and steal the meat from the lion I mean steal the meat from the lion I mean steal the meat from the lion I mean there's just even more grounds as could there's just even more grounds as could there's just even more grounds as could be faulted on but when you start be faulted on but when you start be faulted on but when you start thinking about it you realize that this thinking about it you realize that this thinking about it you realize that this is a very appealing diet and the people is a very appealing diet and the people is a very appealing diet and the people pointing it out there are making pointing it out there are making pointing it out there are making millions of dollars off it if not more millions of dollars off it if not more millions of dollars off it if not more but it does nothing for your but it does nothing for your but it does nothing for your health so now we've looked at three of health so now we've looked at three of health so now we've looked at three of the main myths that keep you eating the main myths that keep you eating the main myths that keep you eating protein unnecessarily so let's look into protein unnecessarily so let's look into protein unnecessarily so let's look into well you might be thinking to yourself well you might be thinking to yourself well you might be thinking to yourself well what should I be eating well what should I be eating well what should I be eating instead okay well let's look at that if instead okay well let's look at that if instead okay well let's look at that if you're not going to be eating all this you're not going to be eating all this you're not going to be eating all this animal food what are you going to eat to animal food what are you going to eat to animal food what are you going to eat to get the optimal amount of protein and get the optimal amount of protein and get the optimal amount of protein and the right kind of protein so you don't the right kind of protein so you don't the right kind of protein so you don't you know get this highly dreaded protein you know get this highly dreaded protein you know get this highly dreaded protein deficiency deficiency deficiency diseases so the first thing to do if diseases so the first thing to do if diseases so the first thing to do if you're on a plant-based diet a whole you're on a plant-based diet a whole you're on a plant-based diet a whole food plant-based diet which is what I'm food plant-based diet which is what I'm food plant-based diet which is what I'm going to talk about is don't stress going to talk about is don't stress going to talk about is don't stress about protein and don't dissect your about protein and don't dissect your about protein and don't dissect your food Dr T and Campbell probably most of food Dr T and Campbell probably most of food Dr T and Campbell probably most of you have heard of him he's the author of you have heard of him he's the author of you have heard of him he's the author of The China Study has said your body does The China Study has said your body does The China Study has said your body does the math that's a very important thing the math that's a very important thing the math that's a very important thing to remember your body does the math when to remember your body does the math when to remember your body does the math when you eat a whole food plant-based diet you eat a whole food plant-based diet you eat a whole food plant-based diet you don't have to worry about it you you don't have to worry about it you you don't have to worry about it you don't have to start dissecting it and so don't have to start dissecting it and so don't have to start dissecting it and so that way that's profoundly liberating that way that's profoundly liberating that way that's profoundly liberating because you don't have to go around and because you don't have to go around and because you don't have to go around and try to be counting grams of protein or try to be counting grams of protein or try to be counting grams of protein or you know carb or anything else it's just you know carb or anything else it's just you know carb or anything else it's just going to be going to be going to be automatic and these the reason it shows automatic and these the reason it shows automatic and these the reason it shows little team here is that these Whole little team here is that these Whole little team here is that these Whole Food nutrients are a superstar team and Food nutrients are a superstar team and Food nutrients are a superstar team and they all work together very they all work together very they all work together very synergistically and this is true for synergistically and this is true for synergistically and this is true for everyone again there's another whole everyone again there's another whole everyone again there's another whole series of myth out there that it's true series of myth out there that it's true series of myth out there that it's true for some people but not others because for some people but not others because for some people but not others because of their blood type well you know we of their blood type well you know we of their blood type well you know we just talked about the fact that there's just talked about the fact that there's just talked about the fact that there's over 2 million kinds of protein in your over 2 million kinds of protein in your over 2 million kinds of protein in your body why would one protein out of those body why would one protein out of those body why would one protein out of those over 2 million determine what you should over 2 million determine what you should over 2 million determine what you should eat does that make any sense to you eat does that make any sense to you eat does that make any sense to you hopefully not at this point so there's hopefully not at this point so there's hopefully not at this point so there's no relation to blood type whatsoever no relation to blood type whatsoever no relation to blood type whatsoever it's not a function of genetics within it's not a function of genetics within it's not a function of genetics within each species every individual in that each species every individual in that each species every individual in that species eats pretty much the same thing species eats pretty much the same thing species eats pretty much the same thing so there's no reason to think people so there's no reason to think people so there's no reason to think people would be any different so for example if would be any different so for example if would be any different so for example if you think about rabbits just to take a you think about rabbits just to take a you think about rabbits just to take a totally random example some rabbits you totally random example some rabbits you totally random example some rabbits you wouldn't say some rabbits eat grass and wouldn't say some rabbits eat grass and wouldn't say some rabbits eat grass and other rabbits eat fish right the rabbits other rabbits eat fish right the rabbits other rabbits eat fish right the rabbits they're going to eat plants and it's the they're going to eat plants and it's the they're going to eat plants and it's the same thing with humans we all clearly same thing with humans we all clearly same thing with humans we all clearly genetically different just like all the genetically different just like all the genetically different just like all the rabbits are genetically different but it rabbits are genetically different but it rabbits are genetically different but it doesn't mean we're eating different doesn't mean we're eating different doesn't mean we're eating different foods because we're eating the food that foods because we're eating the food that foods because we're eating the food that our species is designed for so the whole our species is designed for so the whole our species is designed for so the whole plant foods are going to keep you on plant foods are going to keep you on plant foods are going to keep you on target they're going to get you the target they're going to get you the target they're going to get you the right amount of protein and the right right amount of protein and the right right amount of protein and the right kind of protein which is we just talked kind of protein which is we just talked kind of protein which is we just talked about you want to be at the center of about you want to be at the center of about you want to be at the center of the bullseye and the animal food diet is the bullseye and the animal food diet is the bullseye and the animal food diet is keeping you way above the center of the keeping you way above the center of the keeping you way above the center of the bullseye you're not even on the target bullseye you're not even on the target bullseye you're not even on the target anymore so how does that happen What anymore so how does that happen What anymore so how does that happen What Whole Food plant-based diet should you Whole Food plant-based diet should you Whole Food plant-based diet should you eat well there's no one answer I you eat well there's no one answer I you eat well there's no one answer I you guys have a lot of speakers here and guys have a lot of speakers here and guys have a lot of speakers here and you're going to hear different you're going to hear different you're going to hear different information and it's all good information and it's all good information and it's all good information and there's a lot of kinds information and there's a lot of kinds information and there's a lot of kinds of Whole Food plant-based diets you can of Whole Food plant-based diets you can of Whole Food plant-based diets you can eat and be healthy I'm going to suggest eat and be healthy I'm going to suggest eat and be healthy I'm going to suggest one that I call the perfect formula diet one that I call the perfect formula diet one that I call the perfect formula diet that works very well I don't want you to that works very well I don't want you to that works very well I don't want you to think it's the only one but this one is think it's the only one but this one is think it's the only one but this one is very simple to follow and it's going to very simple to follow and it's going to very simple to follow and it's going to get you the right amount of calories get you the right amount of calories get you the right amount of calories nutrients and protein and there's four nutrients and protein and there's four nutrients and protein and there's four pillars of this diet so a quarter's pillars of this diet so a quarter's pillars of this diet so a quarter's vegetables a quar is fruit a quarter is vegetables a quar is fruit a quarter is vegetables a quar is fruit a quarter is potatoes and legumes and a quarter is potatoes and legumes and a quarter is potatoes and legumes and a quarter is whole grains legumes by the way are like whole grains legumes by the way are like whole grains legumes by the way are like beans and peas and you can think of a beans and peas and you can think of a beans and peas and you can think of a quarter as being like the plate because quarter as being like the plate because quarter as being like the plate because it's like volume so if you look at a it's like volume so if you look at a it's like volume so if you look at a plate but not the USDA plate a different plate but not the USDA plate a different plate but not the USDA plate a different plate and you cut it into plate and you cut it into plate and you cut it into quarters you're going to eat a quarter quarters you're going to eat a quarter quarters you're going to eat a quarter of each of these kind of foods and you of each of these kind of foods and you of each of these kind of foods and you don't have to be really rigorous about don't have to be really rigorous about don't have to be really rigorous about it you don't have to eat them in any it you don't have to eat them in any it you don't have to eat them in any special order you don't have to worry if special order you don't have to worry if special order you don't have to worry if you eat three baked potatoes in a row you eat three baked potatoes in a row you eat three baked potatoes in a row the point is you just want to eat the point is you just want to eat the point is you just want to eat generous amounts of all these kind of generous amounts of all these kind of generous amounts of all these kind of foods you want to eat when you're foods you want to eat when you're foods you want to eat when you're hungry moderately hungry you don't want hungry moderately hungry you don't want hungry moderately hungry you don't want to wait till you're famished you want to to wait till you're famished you want to to wait till you're famished you want to eat slowly and enjoy your food and stop eat slowly and enjoy your food and stop eat slowly and enjoy your food and stop eating when you're eating when you're eating when you're full and that's pretty much all there is full and that's pretty much all there is full and that's pretty much all there is to it now there are more Whole Foods for to it now there are more Whole Foods for to it now there are more Whole Foods for Health you can add first off herbs and Health you can add first off herbs and Health you can add first off herbs and spices which I always like to think of spices which I always like to think of spices which I always like to think of as another kind of whole food because as another kind of whole food because as another kind of whole food because they make your food more interesting they make your food more interesting they make your food more interesting flavorful they have a lot of very flavorful they have a lot of very flavorful they have a lot of very beneficial phytonutrients in them they beneficial phytonutrients in them they beneficial phytonutrients in them they keep keep your food interesting they keep keep your food interesting they keep keep your food interesting they keep you from adding so much salt to keep you from adding so much salt to keep you from adding so much salt to your food because you can enjoy the your food because you can enjoy the your food because you can enjoy the spices instead of just pouring on salt spices instead of just pouring on salt spices instead of just pouring on salt so you want to do that and then in terms so you want to do that and then in terms so you want to do that and then in terms of nuts people ask about nuts a lot you of nuts people ask about nuts a lot you of nuts people ask about nuts a lot you want to just eat small amounts so you want to just eat small amounts so you want to just eat small amounts so you know you might eat a handful or two a know you might eat a handful or two a know you might eat a handful or two a day you don't have to eat nuts but if day you don't have to eat nuts but if day you don't have to eat nuts but if you enjoy nuts or nut Butters and you you enjoy nuts or nut Butters and you you enjoy nuts or nut Butters and you want to make a peanut butter sandwich or want to make a peanut butter sandwich or want to make a peanut butter sandwich or some kind of nut sauce or something like some kind of nut sauce or something like some kind of nut sauce or something like that it's fine to eat the nuts to these that it's fine to eat the nuts to these that it's fine to eat the nuts to these six Whole Food categories there's not six Whole Food categories there's not six Whole Food categories there's not much you have to worry about we're not much you have to worry

you're worrying about to the extent that you're worrying about to the extent that you're worrying about Omega-3s and you know you need to Omega-3s and you know you need to Omega-3s and you know you need to balance your Omega-3s and Omega sixes balance your Omega-3s and Omega sixes balance your Omega-3s and Omega sixes you want to eat ground flax seed for you want to eat ground flax seed for you want to eat ground flax seed for that and again another easy way to do that and again another easy way to do that and again another easy way to do that is just don't need oils remember that is just don't need oils remember that is just don't need oils remember plant oils are a processed food I showed plant oils are a processed food I showed plant oils are a processed food I showed you that picture of plant oils sitting you that picture of plant oils sitting you that picture of plant oils sitting in jars in the supermarket shelves in jars in the supermarket shelves in jars in the supermarket shelves that's highly processed food that is not that's highly processed food that is not that's highly processed food that is not a whole a whole a whole food so when we're thinking of grain food so when we're thinking of grain food so when we're thinking of grain whole grains are Whole Foods things like whole grains are Whole Foods things like whole grains are Whole Foods things like white bread and white rice are not Whole white bread and white rice are not Whole white bread and white rice are not Whole Food fats things like nuts and avocados Food fats things like nuts and avocados Food fats things like nuts and avocados and olves or Whole Foods the oils the and olves or Whole Foods the oils the and olves or Whole Foods the oils the separated oils that come in a jar or in separated oils that come in a jar or in separated oils that come in a jar or in a tub or not Whole Foods so you want to a tub or not Whole Foods so you want to a tub or not Whole Foods so you want to stay away from things that are highly stay away from things that are highly stay away from things that are highly processed even if they're plants and processed even if they're plants and processed even if they're plants and that's the essence of the whole food that's the essence of the whole food that's the essence of the whole food plant-based diet now there's two plant-based diet now there's two plant-based diet now there's two essential nutrients you need that don't essential nutrients you need that don't essential nutrients you need that don't really come from food and they're not really come from food and they're not really come from food and they're not part of the the plant food chain so you part of the the plant food chain so you part of the the plant food chain so you want to have to worry about them want to have to worry about them want to have to worry about them separately so when is vitamin B12 so the separately so when is vitamin B12 so the separately so when is vitamin B12 so the vitamins you need the only vitamin that vitamins you need the only vitamin that vitamins you need the only vitamin that is not made by plants is B12 which are is not made by plants is B12 which are is not made by plants is B12 which are actually made by bacteria so bacteria actually made by bacteria so bacteria actually made by bacteria so bacteria make your make your make your B12 so you don't want to eat B12 so you don't want to eat B12 so you don't want to eat contaminated food that's very highly Lac contaminated food that's very highly Lac contaminated food that's very highly Lac with bacteria or drink contaminated with bacteria or drink contaminated with bacteria or drink contaminated water that's full of bacteria and we all water that's full of bacteria and we all water that's full of bacteria and we all sterilize everything these days which sterilize everything these days which sterilize everything these days which remember our ancestors on savanas of remember our ancestors on savanas of remember our ancestors on savanas of Africa did not sterilize food so they Africa did not sterilize food so they Africa did not sterilize food so they were getting lots of B12 but we eat were getting lots of B12 but we eat were getting lots of B12 but we eat sterilized food so where are you going sterilized food so where are you going sterilized food so where are you going to get your B12 well the simplest thing to get your B12 well the simplest thing to get your B12 well the simplest thing is just take a supplement and it's is just take a supplement and it's is just take a supplement and it's really the only supplement I would really the only supplement I would really the only supplement I would recommend is the B12 because it's very recommend is the B12 because it's very recommend is the B12 because it's very inexpensive you're not going to be inexpensive you're not going to be inexpensive you're not going to be harmed by taking it you know now you're harmed by taking it you know now you're harmed by taking it you know now you're not really going to take too much just not really going to take too much just not really going to take too much just get a bottle and take it and don't worry get a bottle and take it and don't worry get a bottle and take it and don't worry is it in my nutritional yeast is it in is it in my nutritional yeast is it in is it in my nutritional yeast is it in my breakfast cereal and then vitamin D my breakfast cereal and then vitamin D my breakfast cereal and then vitamin D is something you actually make here in is something you actually make here in is something you actually make here in Hawaii by having this sun on your skin Hawaii by having this sun on your skin Hawaii by having this sun on your skin if you're unfortunate enough to live if you're unfortunate enough to live if you're unfortunate enough to live somewhere where there's not much sun you somewhere where there's not much sun you somewhere where there's not much sun you might actually have to end up taking a d might actually have to end up taking a d might actually have to end up taking a d supplement but we very much prefer not supplement but we very much prefer not supplement but we very much prefer not to do that for you to get enough Sun to do that for you to get enough Sun to do that for you to get enough Sun that you can make your own vitamin D that you can make your own vitamin D that you can make your own vitamin D which is NOT saying excess of sun but which is NOT saying excess of sun but which is NOT saying excess of sun but enough to make your own vitamin D and enough to make your own vitamin D and enough to make your own vitamin D and that's kind of a complicated subject in that's kind of a complicated subject in that's kind of a complicated subject in its own right but to boil it down for its own right but to boil it down for its own right but to boil it down for most people that's about 15 to 20 most people that's about 15 to 20 most people that's about 15 to 20 minutes a day it can vary based on a lot minutes a day it can vary based on a lot minutes a day it can vary based on a lot of factors but if you can get that much of factors but if you can get that much of factors but if you can get that much sun on most days you're going to be okay sun on most days you're going to be okay sun on most days you're going to be okay for most people again you can be tested for most people again you can be tested for most people again you can be tested for it but those are really the only two for it but those are really the only two for it but those are really the only two nutrients you have to worry about on a nutrients you have to worry about on a nutrients you have to worry about on a whole food plant-based diet in terms of whole food plant-based diet in terms of whole food plant-based diet in terms of breaking it out and consuming them breaking it out and consuming them breaking it out and consuming them separately you don't have to worry about separately you don't have to worry about separately you don't have to worry about the protein the vitamins and minerals or the protein the vitamins and minerals or the protein the vitamins and minerals or anything like that you're going to get anything like that you're going to get anything like that you're going to get the right the right the right amount so actually it's very simple I amount so actually it's very simple I amount so actually it's very simple I hope you're sitting there going gee this hope you're sitting there going gee this hope you're sitting there going gee this is a lot simpler than I thought it was is a lot simpler than I thought it was is a lot simpler than I thought it was going to be this is easy to do and I've going to be this is easy to do and I've going to be this is easy to do and I've learned some things I've Lear when I eat learned some things I've Lear when I eat learned some things I've Lear when I eat too much protein it's turned into too much protein it's turned into too much protein it's turned into glucose and fat and that's not what I glucose and fat and that's not what I glucose and fat and that's not what I want and I'm spending $30 a jar on this want and I'm spending $30 a jar on this want and I'm spending $30 a jar on this protein pattern it's doing nothing but protein pattern it's doing nothing but protein pattern it's doing nothing but destroying my liver and kidneys and destroying my liver and kidneys and destroying my liver and kidneys and causing inflammation and making any causing inflammation and making any causing inflammation and making any cancer cells grow so I don't really need cancer cells grow so I don't really need cancer cells grow so I don't really need this I'm just going to eat whole plant this I'm just going to eat whole plant this I'm just going to eat whole plant foods and get what I foods and get what I foods and get what I need so if you look at this slide this need so if you look at this slide this need so if you look at this slide this lady's going to show us how easy it is lady's going to show us how easy it is lady's going to show us how easy it is it's really that easy it's really the it's really that easy it's really the it's really that easy it's really the foods you put in your cart just buy foods you put in your cart just buy foods you put in your cart just buy bunch of Whole Foods enjoy them cook bunch of Whole Foods enjoy them cook bunch of Whole Foods enjoy them cook them up make them into soups and salads them up make them into soups and salads them up make them into soups and salads and rice and pasta dishes and sandwiches and rice and pasta dishes and sandwiches and rice and pasta

of great things smoothies and all kinds of great things and and enjoy your and and enjoy your and and enjoy your food [Applause] [Applause] thanks okay the question was what about thanks okay the question was what about thanks okay the question was what about extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil and other kinds of oil that have been and other kinds of oil that have been and other kinds of oil that have been tatted as like Health Miracles and we tatted as like Health Miracles and we tatted as like Health Miracles and we need to eat them they're actually highly need to eat them they're actually highly need to eat them they're actually highly processed foods you don't need them processed foods you don't need them processed foods you don't need them they're actually they're actually they're actually inflammatory and they're very very inflammatory and they're very very inflammatory and they're very very highly concentrated sources of highly concentrated sources of highly concentrated sources of calories so you really don't want to calories so you really don't want to calories so you really don't want to have those so I would stay away from any have those so I would stay away from any have those so I would stay away from any processed food but especially oil you processed food but especially oil you processed food but especially oil you know you've all heard sugar is bad so know you've all heard sugar is bad so know you've all heard sugar is bad so the thing to remember is sugar is bad the thing to remember is sugar is bad the thing to remember is sugar is bad but oil is worse but oil is worse but oil is worse because it's has over twice the calories because it's has over twice the calories because it's has over twice the calories per Spoonful not neither one of them has per Spoonful not neither one of them has per Spoonful not neither one of them has any nutrients that you need the sugar any nutrients that you need the sugar any nutrients that you need the sugar doesn't have nutrients and the oil doesn't have nutrients and the oil doesn't have nutrients and the oil doesn't have nutrients but the oil has doesn't have nutrients but the oil has doesn't have nutrients but the oil has over twice as many empty calories so no over twice as many empty calories so no over twice as many empty calories so no reason to eat reason to eat reason to eat it okay I I believe the question if I it okay I I believe the question if I it okay I I believe the question if I heard you right was what are the signs heard you right was what are the signs heard you right was what are the signs of ammonia of ammonia of ammonia poisoning you you would be dead so poisoning you you would be dead so poisoning you you would be dead so that's a sign if you were poisoned with that's a sign if you were poisoned with that's a sign if you were poisoned with pneumonia you're dead and that's what pneumonia you're dead and that's what pneumonia you're dead and that's what happens to those infants who are born happens to those infants who are born happens to those infants who are born unable to turn amonia into Uria unless unable to turn amonia into Uria unless unable to turn amonia into Uria unless you're put on an ultra low protein you're put on an ultra low protein you're put on an ultra low protein diet all right I think the question was diet all right I think the question was diet all right I think the question was about gluten intolerance correct okay about gluten intolerance correct okay about gluten intolerance correct okay gluten is a wheat protein it's also in gluten is a wheat protein it's also in gluten is a wheat protein it's also in some other kinds of whole grain but some other kinds of whole grain but some other kinds of whole grain but people think of it mostly in connection people think of it mostly in connection people think of it mostly in connection with wheat and it's just a kind of with wheat and it's just a kind of with wheat and it's just a kind of protein in the wheat there are people protein in the wheat there are people protein in the wheat there are people with the disease called celiac disease with the disease called celiac disease with the disease called celiac disease that cannot process this particular that cannot process this particular that cannot process this particular protein and it can be a huge issue for protein and it can be a huge issue for protein and it can be a huge issue for them and cause extremely serious health them and cause extremely serious health them and cause extremely serious health problems that's thought to be about one problems that's thought to be about one problems that's thought to be about one out of every 133 people no the the out of every 133 people no the the out of every 133 people no the the question was does gluten cause question was does gluten cause question was does gluten cause inflammation everyone no animal protein inflammation everyone no animal protein inflammation everyone no animal protein causes inflammation with far greater causes inflammation with far greater causes inflammation with far greater frequency than gluten which is just a frequency than gluten which is just a frequency than gluten which is just a plant protein the people that have been plant protein the people that have been plant protein the people that have been shown to be the longest lived people on shown to be the longest lived people on shown to be the longest lived people on the planet are actually people who are the planet are actually people who are the planet are actually people who are on a traditional diet in okanawa which on a traditional diet in okanawa which on a traditional diet in okanawa which is actually a tropical area where it's a is actually a tropical area where it's a is actually a tropical area where it's a beautiful tropical island where you know beautiful tropical island where you know beautiful tropical island where you know plants grow in abundance just like they plants grow in abundance just like they plants grow in abundance just like they grow in abundance on Hawaii and this has grow in abundance on Hawaii and this has grow in abundance on Hawaii and this has been scientifically proven and been scientifically proven and been scientifically proven and documented that elenowen in fact and documented that elenowen in fact and documented that elenowen in fact and again I'm not talking about them today again I'm not talking about them today again I'm not talking about them today because now they're eaing McDonald's and because now they're eaing McDonald's and because now they're eaing McDonald's and all kinds of stuff but the ones that ate all kinds of stuff but the ones that ate all kinds of stuff but the ones that ate the traditional diet had the highest the traditional diet had the highest the traditional diet had the highest concentration of people who live to be concentration of people who live to be concentration of people who live to be over hundred of any culture on the over hundred of any culture on the over hundred of any culture on the entire entire entire planet so what did those people eat planet so what did those people eat planet so what did those people eat these are the healthy Long Live these are the healthy Long Live these are the healthy Long Live people well there's been some research people well there's been some research people well there's been some research done about what they ate and in fact done about what they ate and in fact done about what they ate and in fact there's a lot of information in the there's a lot of information in the there's a lot of information in the archives about what they ate these archives about what they ate these archives about what they ate these people got approximately 9% of their people got approximately 9% of their people got approximately 9% of their calories from protein about 6% from fat calories from protein about 6% from fat calories from protein about 6% from fat about 85% from about 85% from about 85% from

everybody was obviously knowing it was everybody was obviously knowing we have to get as much protein as we can we have to get as much protein as we can we have to get as much protein as we can okay okay okay that's what our deal was is to oh good thank you can you hear me better oh good thank you can you hear me better yeah okay so so we so i end up in the yeah okay so so we so i end up in the yeah okay so so we so i end up in the philippines philippines philippines they're attempting to identify ways for they're attempting to identify ways for they're attempting to identify ways for these

and i think many of you can identify and i think many of you can identify and i think many of you can identify with that how many of you have sort of with that how many of you have sort of with that how many of you have sort of gotten into this business gotten into this business gotten into this business and your friends ask you where you get and your friends ask you where you get and your friends ask you where you get your protein from your protein from your protein from you know this idea still hangs around so you know this idea still hangs around so you know this idea still hangs around so i want to develop i want to develop i want to develop work on that theme a bit so now work on that theme a bit so now work on that theme a bit so now i'm in the philippines um i i'm in the philippines um i i'm in the philippines um i was aware we're supposed to get more was aware we're supposed to get more was aware we're supposed to get more protein i can't get all the details on protein i can't get all the details on protein i can't get all the details on that particular point of view that particular point of view that particular point of view but about that time of this study came but about that time of this study came but about that time of this study came out in india out in india out in india showing that in experimental animals in showing that in experimental animals in showing that in experimental animals in this case rats this case rats this case rats that when these rats are exposed to a that when these rats are exposed to a that when these rats are exposed to a carcinogen that gives rise to liver carcinogen that gives rise to liver carcinogen that gives rise to liver cancer cancer cancer okay it starts out you know they're okay it starts out you know they're okay it starts out you know they're exposed to a carcinogen it gives rise to exposed to a carcinogen it gives rise to exposed to a carcinogen it gives rise to liver cancer liver cancer liver cancer if they are fed a couple levels of if they are fed a couple levels of if they are fed a couple levels of protein high and low protein high and low protein high and low that their thesis was or hypothesis was that their thesis was or hypothesis was that their thesis was or hypothesis was that the animals given the higher levels that the animals given the higher levels that the animals given the higher levels of protein would get less cancer of protein would get less cancer of protein would get less cancer such was the importance of protein it such was the importance of protein it such was the importance of protein it does you know does everything if we does you know does everything if we does you know does everything if we could just get more could just get more could just get more protein consumed we could have less protein consumed we could have less protein consumed we could have less cancer that was our idea cancer that was our idea cancer that was our idea as you can see here the opposite as you can see here the opposite as you can see here the opposite appeared appeared appeared the opposite appeared they they couldn't the opposite appeared they they couldn't the opposite appeared they they couldn't even go along with their own results even go along with their own results even go along with their own results quite frankly they went back and redid quite frankly they went back and redid quite frankly they went back and redid the study in a very different way the study in a very different way the study in a very different way and attempting to show it was a reverse and attempting to show it was a reverse and attempting to show it was a reverse i had a chance to go to india about 25 i had a chance to go to india about 25 i had a chance to go to india about 25 years after that years after that years after that to talk about the fact that i didn't see to talk about the fact that i didn't see to talk about the fact that i didn't see it that way it that way it that way that the animals given the highest that the animals given the highest that the animals given the highest protein levels protein levels protein levels got a hundred percent small study got a hundred percent small study got a hundred percent small study hundred percent got the liver tumors hundred percent got the liver tumors hundred percent got the liver tumors and the ones that fed five percent none and the ones that fed five percent none and the ones that fed five percent none did that was striking did that was striking did that was striking increasing protein increasing cancer how increasing protein increasing cancer how increasing protein increasing cancer how do you like that do you like that do you like that so i mean there's someone wearing just so i mean there's someone wearing just so i mean there's someone wearing just two hats and essentially i'm interested two hats and essentially i'm interested two hats and essentially i'm interested in the science i want to in the science i want to in the science i want to i want to deal with the facts but on the i want to deal with the facts but on the i want to deal with the facts but on the other hand we're all worshiping protein other hand we're all worshiping protein other hand we're all worshiping protein if you will if you will if you will and somebody somehow like this this and somebody somehow like this this and somebody somehow like this this comes along as soon as shakes the comes along as soon as shakes the comes along as soon as shakes the shakes the bushes a bit so came home shakes the bushes a bit so came home shakes the bushes a bit so came home got a grant it lasted for the next 27 got a grant it lasted for the next 27 got a grant it lasted for the next 27 years and i really wanted to know years and i really wanted to know years and i really wanted to know you know is that really true and if this you know is that really true and if this you know is that really true and if this is true how does it work what's the what is true how does it work what's the what is true how does it work what's the what we call we call we call mechanisms so here's a little chart mechanisms so here's a little chart mechanisms so here's a little chart showing showing showing the first 12 weeks as the cancers are the first 12 weeks as the cancers are the first 12 weeks as the cancers are growing growing growing i mean all cancers start with a mutation i mean all cancers start with a mutation i mean all cancers start with a mutation with a mutated gene with a mutated gene with a mutated gene so they're supposed to incarcerate that so they're supposed to incarcerate that so they're supposed to incarcerate that mutant cause a mutation mutant cause a mutation mutant cause a mutation okay then if that twenty percent of five okay then if that twenty percent of five okay then if that twenty percent of five percent just like the indian workers did percent just like the indian workers did percent just like the indian workers did you can see the difference is huge it's you can see the difference is huge it's you can see the difference is huge it's huge huge huge once but twenty percent they're all once but twenty percent they're all once but twenty percent they're all getting cancer it's going fast getting cancer it's going fast getting cancer it's going fast this is just for during the first three this is just for during the first three this is just for during the first three months which is you know quite a long months which is you know quite a long months which is you know quite a long time time time for a rat but here here's here's i want for a rat but here here's here's i want for a rat but here here's here's i want to show you this because something came to show you this because something came to show you this because something came up up up this wasn't exactly done in this order this wasn't exactly done in this order this wasn't exactly done in this order but here's what happened but here's what happened but here's what happened i was curious about this idea that i was curious about this idea that i was curious about this idea that cancer is caused by genes cancer is caused by genes cancer is caused by genes namely mutations and mutations for those namely mutations and mutations for those namely mutations and mutations for those of you not familiar with this of you not familiar with this of you not familiar with this our genes are mutated by chemical our genes are mutated by chemical our genes are mutated by chemical carcinogens they're changed carcinogens they're changed carcinogens they're changed so that now the new gene if it's not so that now the new gene if it's not so that now the new gene if it's not repaired then becomes the basis for repaired then becomes the basis for repaired then becomes the basis for cancers to grow i wanted to know in this cancers to grow i wanted to know in this cancers to grow i wanted to know in this particular case particular case particular case whether let's say after two and a half whether let's say after two and a half whether let's say after two and a half months months months they got the exposure of the carcinogen they got the exposure of the carcinogen they got the exposure of the carcinogen at that time you think you would think at that time you think you would think at that time you think you would think that that that all the mutations are well reversed all the mutations are well reversed all the mutations are well reversed right or they're gone or the right or they're gone or the right or they're gone or the cortisone is not there we fed them 20 cortisone is not there we fed them 20 cortisone is not there we fed them 20 protein protein protein and lo and behold what it showed was and lo and behold what it showed was and lo and behold what it showed was we saw a tumor response after we saw a tumor response after we saw a tumor response after one would have thought those genes are one would have thought those genes are one would have thought those genes are gone gone gone no they were still there kind of hanging no they were still there kind of hanging no they were still there kind of hanging around that led to a major consideration around that led to a major consideration around that led to a major consideration that over the years it turns out that that over the years it turns out that that over the years it turns out that cancer in this case here suggest that cancer in this case here suggest that cancer in this case here suggest that cancer doesn't form as a cancer doesn't form as a cancer doesn't form as a result of the gene or the mutation it result of the gene or the mutation it result of the gene or the mutation it focuses primarily as in this case at focuses primarily as in this case at focuses primarily as in this case at least least least as a function of nutrition very as a function of nutrition very as a function of nutrition very different so here's another way to look different so here's another way to look different so here's another way to look at the same thing at the same thing at the same thing i ended up with with a number of ideas i ended up with with a number of ideas i ended up with with a number of ideas that now since have become very that now since have become very that now since have become very provocative even more provocative provocative even more provocative provocative even more provocative in the sense that it tends to challenge in the sense that it tends to challenge in the sense that it tends to challenge the way we think or the way the way we think or the way the way we think or the way we do things so here's my first we do things so here's my first we do things so here's my first challenge challenge challenge cancer begins with a mutated gene that cancer begins with a mutated gene that cancer begins with a mutated gene that may lie dormant may lie dormant may lie dormant until developed by major by nutrition until developed by major by nutrition until developed by major by nutrition not by genes not by genes not by genes just think about that we all have some just think about that we all have some just think about that we all have some genes that could give rise to cancer we genes that could give rise to cancer we genes that could give rise to cancer we have the seeds if you will and when the have the seeds if you will and when the have the seeds if you will and when the reason reason reason for the most part not to oversimplify for the most part not to oversimplify for the most part not to oversimplify the reason we tend to get cancer the reason we tend to get cancer the reason we tend to get cancer is because we're feeding the wrong is because we're feeding the wrong is because we're feeding the wrong nutrition to those genes so nutrition to those genes so nutrition to those genes so they come up and they form cancer here's they come up and they form cancer here's they come up and they form cancer here's another way to look at this another way to look at this another way to look at this same basis i showed before i wanted to same basis i showed before i wanted to same basis i showed before i wanted to know in this particular case know in this particular case know in this particular case what happens if we change the diet from what happens if we change the diet from what happens if we change the diet from twenty to five percent or five percent twenty to five percent or five percent twenty to five percent or five percent to twenty percent if you will to twenty percent if you will to twenty percent if you will here's the results we got first three here's the results we got first three here's the results we got first three weeks these early cancer growing in weeks these early cancer growing in weeks these early cancer growing in response to 20 response to 20 response to 20 turned off for the next three weeks turned off for the next three weeks turned off for the next three weeks turned back on turned off to me that was turned back on turned off to me that was turned back on turned off to me that was really a really a really a spectacular sort of thing the idea that spectacular sort of thing the idea that spectacular sort of thing the idea that we could take nutrition we could take nutrition we could take nutrition right within normal levels of right within normal levels of right within normal levels of consumption more or less consumption more or less consumption more or less and adjust it adjust the amount being and adjust it adjust the amount being and adjust it adjust the amount being consumed and actually change the course consumed and actually change the course consumed and actually change the course of the development of the disease that of the development of the disease that of the development of the disease that was was was very exciting so in a sense we're very exciting so in a sense we're very exciting so in a sense we're turning on to turn off cancer turning on to turn off cancer turning on to turn off cancer [Music]",

he's been a long time member of the Zoe he's been a long time member of the Zoe he's been a long time member of the Zoe scientific Advisory Board and he's also scientific Advisory Board and he's also scientific Advisory Board and he's also been one of the authors of a major been one of the authors of a major been one of the authors of a major review of protein requirements for review of protein requirements for review of protein requirements for nutrition review so sort of no one nutrition review so sort of no one nutrition review so sort of no one better to talk about protein which is better to talk about protein which is better to talk about protein which is one of the topics we've had the most one of the topics we've had the most one of the topics we've had the most questions from our listeners and members questions from our listeners and members questions from our listeners and members of anything that we touched on on this of anything that we touched on on this of anything that we touched on on this podcast podcast podcast so I think it's gonna be a lot of fun uh so I think it's gonna be a lot of fun uh so I think it's gonna be a lot of fun uh thank you for for being here with us thank you for for being here with us thank you for for being here with us absolutely this is a topic that is near absolutely this is a topic that is near absolutely this is a topic that is near and dear to my heart many myths to be and dear to my heart many myths to be and dear to my heart many myths to be busted well on the topic of mythbusting busted well on the topic of mythbusting busted well on the topic of mythbusting uh why don't we start with our usual uh why don't we start with our usual uh why don't we start with our usual quick fire round of questions from our quick fire round of questions from our quick fire round of questions from our listeners and just to remind you listeners and just to remind you listeners and just to remind you Christopher you know the rules are are Christopher you know the rules are are Christopher you know the rules are are quite simple you can say yes you can say quite simple you can say yes you can say quite simple you can say yes you can say no or if you have to you're allowed a no or if you have to you're allowed a no or if you have to you're allowed a one sentence answer one sentence answer one sentence answer but no more than that and we know that but no more than that and we know that but no more than that and we know that this is the hardest thing for any this is the hardest thing for any this is the hardest thing for any Professor to do but are you willing to Professor to do but are you willing to Professor to do but are you willing to give it a go yes give it a go yes give it a go yes all right you've got the hang of it all right you've got the hang of it all right you've got the hang of it already yes already yes already yes okay Christopher will I die if I don't okay Christopher will I die if I don't okay Christopher will I die if I don't get any protein in my food yes get any protein in my food yes get any protein in my food yes do animals contain special proteins that do animals contain special proteins that do animals contain special proteins that you can't get from Plants now should we you can't get from Plants now should we you can't get from Plants now should we all be worrying about getting enough all be worrying about getting enough all be worrying about getting enough protein no protein no protein no are protein shakes and protein bars are protein shakes and protein bars are protein shakes and protein bars healthy for most people healthy for most people healthy for most people compared to a tablespoon of sugar compared to a tablespoon of sugar compared to a tablespoon of sugar healthier but I always think compared to healthier but I always think compared to healthier but I always think compared to what compared to food what compared to food what compared to food no no no I told you it was hard for a professor I told you it was hard for a professor I told you it was hard for a professor to answer these questions to answer these questions to answer these questions and the last question can eating more and the last question can eating more and the last question can eating more protein help with weight loss no okay I think a lot of people are no okay I think a lot of people are already going to be surprised and I hope already going to be surprised and I hope already going to be surprised and I hope we're now going to unpack this uh in the we're now going to unpack this uh in the we're now going to unpack this uh in the rest of the podcast maybe we can just rest of the podcast maybe we can just rest of the podcast maybe we can just start at the very beginning so I think start at the very beginning so I think start at the very beginning so I think most of our listeners will feel they most of our listeners will feel they most of our listeners will feel they know what a fat is right they're know what a fat is right they're know what a fat is right they're thinking of like an oil they cook with thinking of like an oil they cook with thinking of like an oil they cook with or butter or you know maybe the fat in a or butter or you know maybe the fat in a or butter or you know maybe the fat in a piece of meat and I think almost piece of meat and I think almost piece of meat and I think almost everybody feels sort of confident about everybody feels sort of confident about everybody feels sort of confident about a carb right it's like it's bread or a carb right it's like it's bread or a carb right it's like it's bread or potatoes or something like that I think potatoes or something like that I think potatoes or something like that I think however if a lot of people are like me however if a lot of people are like me however if a lot of people are like me they're actually quite unclear really they're actually quite unclear really they're actually quite unclear really what protein is except you know they're what protein is except you know they're what protein is except you know they're sure there's quite a lot of it and a sure there's quite a lot of it and a sure there's quite a lot of it and a piece of meat because you know their mum piece of meat because you know their mum piece of meat because you know their mum always said you know eat your meat and always said you know eat your meat and always said you know eat your meat and get your protein so could you just sort get your protein so could you just sort get your protein so could you just sort of start at the beginning what is of start at the beginning what is of start at the beginning what is protein and why do we need it protein and why do we need it protein and why do we need it sure so when it comes to fat and carb sure so when it comes to fat and carb sure so when it comes to fat and carb that's really most of our fuel that's really most of our fuel that's really most of our fuel when it comes to protein it's more of when it comes to protein it's more of when it comes to protein it's more of our structure our structure our structure so all of our cells and our organs and so all of our cells and our organs and so all of our cells and our organs and our hair and our fingernails all of that our hair and our fingernails all of that our hair and our fingernails all of that is structural protein is structural protein is structural protein all the enzymes that are in our body all the enzymes that are in our body all the enzymes that are in our body that catalyze reactions and make that catalyze reactions and make that catalyze reactions and make metabolism move forward those are all metabolism move forward those are all metabolism move forward those are all proteins many hormones proteins many hormones proteins many hormones our proteins there's actually a huge our proteins there's actually a huge our proteins there's actually a huge list of functional things list of functional things list of functional things that proteins do that proteins do that proteins do and to take it to one next level maybe and to take it to one next level maybe and to take it to one next level maybe this is helpful maybe this is not all this is helpful maybe this is not all this is helpful maybe this is not all proteins are made of 20 amino acids in proteins are made of 20 amino acids in proteins are made of 20 amino acids in the human body and I like to think of the human body and I like to think of the human body and I like to think of them like Scrabble letters in the them like Scrabble letters in the them like Scrabble letters in the Scrabble board game or the letter Scrabble board game or the letter Scrabble board game or the letter somebody would put on the Marquee of a somebody would put on the Marquee of a somebody would put on the Marquee of a movie theater and for perspective movie theater and for perspective movie theater and for perspective there's a couple of them that are only there's a couple of them that are only there's a couple of them that are only three amino acids tied together which three amino acids tied together which three amino acids tied together which would be called a tripeptide but that would be called a tripeptide but that would be called a tripeptide but that would be unusual would be unusual would be unusual the largest one I know of is something the largest one I know of is something the largest one I know of is something called maybe Tin Tin 35 called maybe Tin Tin 35 called maybe Tin Tin 35 000 amino acids strung together 000 amino acids strung together 000 amino acids strung together I was thinking about this like words and I was thinking about this like words and I was thinking about this like words and these amino acids like letters but these amino acids like letters but these amino acids like letters but you're saying these words can get really you're saying these words can get really you're saying these words can get really long and you need a lot of them but long and you need a lot of them but long and you need a lot of them but fundamentally you can make any word like fundamentally you can make any word like fundamentally you can make any word like any protein out of just this limited any protein out of just this limited any protein out of just this limited number of these uh these amino acids one number of these uh these amino acids one number of these uh these amino acids one could be a limerick you know and one could be a limerick you know and one could be a limerick you know and one could be a haiku it's just amazing how could be a haiku it's just amazing how could be a haiku it's just amazing how they differ in length and what's they differ in length and what's they differ in length and what's critical is not only that the specific critical is not only that the specific critical is not only that the specific amino acids one after another be perfect amino acids one after another be perfect amino acids one after another be perfect like if you were spell checking your like if you were spell checking your like if you were spell checking your your writing in a document and say nope your writing in a document and say nope your writing in a document and say nope that word doesn't work so it has to be that word doesn't work so it has to be that word doesn't work so it has to be perfect and then when the amino acids perfect and then when the amino acids perfect and then when the amino acids are arranged in a certain configuration are arranged in a certain configuration are arranged in a certain configuration these long strings of amino acids uh these long strings of amino acids uh these long strings of amino acids uh twirl and twist and conform they twirl and twist and conform they twirl and twist and conform they actually have to be side by side in just actually have to be side by side in just actually have to be side by side in just the right way and if you change that and the right way and if you change that and the right way and if you change that and unravel them which happens in your unravel them which happens in your unravel them which happens in your stomach with a low ph stomach with a low ph stomach with a low ph it happens with heat it happens with heat it happens with heat you inactivate the protein and if it was you inactivate the protein and if it was you inactivate the protein and if it was going to have some functional purpose going to have some functional purpose going to have some functional purpose like an enzyme or a hormone like an enzyme or a hormone like an enzyme or a hormone it no longer works and now it's kind of it no longer works and now it's kind of it no longer works and now it's kind of just like fuel now you can just break just like fuel now you can just break just like fuel now you can just break apart the single amino acids and use apart the single amino acids and use apart the single amino acids and use them but it can't function like it was them but it can't function like it was them but it can't function like it was going to and that's why protein's so going to and that's why protein's so going to and that's why protein's so tricky so many things that it does so tricky so many things that it does so tricky so many things that it does so many ways to activate and inactivate it many ways to activate and inactivate it many ways to activate and inactivate it and so Christopher to make sure that and so Christopher to make sure that and so Christopher to make sure that I've got this because that was a little I've got this because that was a little I've got this because that was a little scary what you just described you're scary what you just described you're scary what you just described you're basically saying you know we basically saying you know we basically saying you know we eat food with proteins in it we break it eat food with proteins in it we break it eat food with proteins in it we break it down there are like 20 of the potential down there are like 20 of the potential down there are like 20 of the potential like building blocks like letters which like building blocks like letters which like building blocks like letters which is what you're calling these amino acids is what you're calling these amino acids is what you're calling these amino acids and then our body makes almost and then our body makes almost and then our body makes almost everything we're made of out of those everything we're made of out of those everything we're made of out of those like 20 letters in unimaginably complex like 20 letters in unimaginably complex like 20 letters in unimaginably complex sort of combinations sort of combinations sort of combinations I like the way you said that and let me I like the way you said that and let me I like the way you said that and let me add one twist to this which is pretty add one twist to this which is pretty add one twist to this which is pretty interesting there's very few rare interesting there's very few rare interesting there's very few rare exceptions to this but when you say eat exceptions to this but when you say eat exceptions to this but when you say eat an animal protein or a plant protein and an animal protein or a plant protein and an animal protein or a plant protein and it goes into your digestive tract you it goes into your digestive tract you it goes into your digestive tract you can't absorb those amino acids into your can't absorb those amino acids into your can't absorb those amino acids into your body until you break them down to their body until you break them down to their body until you break them down to their single amino acid levels and then you single amino acid levels and then you single amino acid levels and then you absorb them travels through your body absorb them travels through your body absorb them travels through your body reassembles them can't remember where it reassembles them can't remember where it reassembles them can't remember where it came from oh did this come from a cow oh came from oh did this come from a cow oh came from oh did this come from a cow oh did this come from a pig oh does this did this come from a pig oh does this did this come from a pig oh does this come from broccoli no clue it's like ah come from broccoli no clue it's like ah come from broccoli no clue it's like ah it's just this amino acid I don't even it's just this amino acid I don't even it's just this amino acid I don't even care it came from a supplement care it came from a supplement care it came from a supplement can't even tell it's just the building can't even tell it's just the building can't even tell it's just the building block block block got it so this is like I uh I ate got it so this is like I uh I ate got it so this is like I uh I ate Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my body just breaks it down to letters that body just breaks it down to letters that body just breaks it down to letters that just makes the protein sound even more just makes the protein sound even more just makes the protein sound even more important important important um I guess um I guess um I guess follow-on natural question about this is follow-on natural question about this is follow-on natural question about this is I think one of the things that we've I think one of the things that we've I think one of the things that we've learned on this podcast is that our body learned on this podcast is that our body learned on this podcast is that our body has this amazing ability often to swap has this amazing ability often to swap has this amazing ability often to swap carbs into fat so it doesn't really carbs into fat so it doesn't really carbs into fat so it doesn't really matter what you eat always because your matter what you eat always because your matter what you eat always because your body will make what you need can't we body will make what you need can't we body will make what you need can't we just make these letters these amino just make these letters these amino just make these letters these amino acids when we need them yeah I bet you a acids when we need them yeah I bet you a acids when we need them yeah I bet you a lot of people listening have heard of lot of people listening have heard of lot of people listening have heard of essential and non-essential amino acids essential and non-essential amino acids essential and non-essential amino acids I think it's a pretty non-essential I think it's a pretty non-essential I think it's a pretty non-essential question for all of your listeners but question for all of your listeners but question for all of your listeners but I'm going to say it anyway the I the I'm going to say it anyway the I the I'm going to say it anyway the I the ideas ideas ideas um while carbohydrates and fats are um while carbohydrates and fats are um while carbohydrates and fats are circulating in your body those the basic circulating in your body those the basic circulating in your body those the basic structure of those is is built on structure of those is is built on structure of those is is built on carbons of different lengths and they carbons of different lengths and they carbons of different lengths and they have very complex metabolic pathways and have very complex metabolic pathways and have very complex metabolic pathways and at certain points in carbohydrate at certain points in carbohydrate at certain points in carbohydrate metabolism and fat metabolism you can metabolism and fat metabolism you can metabolism and fat metabolism you can borrow one of these molecules put a borrow one of these molecules put a borrow one of these molecules put a nitrogen on it in the form of an amino nitrogen on it in the form of an amino nitrogen on it in the form of an amino group which means a nitrogen with three group which means a nitrogen with three group which means a nitrogen with three hydrogens hydrogens hydrogens an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen portion you can actually make 11 of the portion you can actually make 11 of the portion you can actually make 11 of the amino acids amino acids amino acids by borrowing something from fat and carb by borrowing something from fat and carb by borrowing something from fat and carb and putting this ammonia amine group on and putting this ammonia amine group on and putting this ammonia amine group on it and likewise if you were breaking it and likewise if you were breaking it and likewise if you were breaking protein down because you had enough for protein down because you had enough for protein down because you had enough for the day which I hope we get to later the day which I hope we get to later the day which I hope we get to later because most people eat more than enough because most people eat more than enough because most people eat more than enough if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen group off you can put it right back into group off you can put it right back into group off you can put it right back into the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing chain and that works for 11 amino acids chain and that works for 11 amino acids chain and that works for 11 amino acids for nine of them there isn't a specific for nine of them there isn't a specific for nine of them there isn't a specific place you can borrow it from in your place you can borrow it from in your place you can borrow it from in your body and so you since you need all 20 body and so you since you need all 20 body and so you since you need all 20 for just about every single protein that for just about every single protein that for just about every single protein that you synthesize you also have to get the you synthesize you also have to get the you synthesize you also have to get the nine essential ones and essential simply nine essential ones and essential simply nine essential ones and essential simply means you can't assemble the whole thing means you can't assemble the whole thing means you can't assemble the whole thing yourself you got to make sure I got that yourself you got to make sure I got that yourself you got to make sure I got that Christopher because it got a bit scary Christopher because it got a bit scary Christopher because it got a bit scary in chemistry again in chemistry again in chemistry again um you're saying there are these 20 um you're saying there are these 20 um you're saying there are these 20 actually we can make some of them actually we can make some of them actually we can make some of them ourselves but actually like I think you ourselves but actually like I think you ourselves but actually like I think you would say nine of them we can't make would say nine of them we can't make would say nine of them we can't make them so you've got to eat them you have them so you've got to eat them you have them so you've got to eat them you have to get those nine in order to do you to get those nine in order to do you to get those nine in order to do you know essential things inside yourself is know essential things inside yourself is know essential things inside yourself is that that that all right so protein is really important all right so protein is really important all right so protein is really important we need to get some we need to get some we need to get some um um um let's talk about how much we therefore let's talk about how much we therefore let's talk about how much we therefore need which was the number one question need which was the number one question need which was the number one question that we had as we were preparing for that we had as we were preparing for that we had as we were preparing for this show this show this show okay uh you're gonna just have to stop okay uh you're gonna just have to stop okay uh you're gonna just have to stop me all over the place and get me to me all over the place and get me to me all over the place and get me to explain it in English because this will explain it in English because this will explain it in English because this will be harder but uh basically you I'm going be harder but uh basically you I'm going be harder but uh basically you I'm going to take one big step back and say if to take one big step back and say if to take one big step back and say if you've eaten enough calories for the day you've eaten enough calories for the day you've eaten enough calories for the day you've got enough protein you've got enough protein you've got enough protein just so stop just so stop just so stop obsessing about protein proteins and obsessing about protein proteins and obsessing about protein proteins and everything all 20 amino acids are in all everything all 20 amino acids are in all everything all 20 amino acids are in all plant Foods big myth to bust here plant Foods big myth to bust here plant Foods big myth to bust here and all animal Foods so if you're simply and all animal Foods so if you're simply and all animal Foods so if you're simply getting enough calories with a getting enough calories with a getting enough calories with a reasonable Variety in your diet like if reasonable Variety in your diet like if reasonable Variety in your diet like if you only ate rice all day you only ate rice all day you only ate rice all day you wouldn't get enough if you only ate you wouldn't get enough if you only ate you wouldn't get enough if you only ate cassava all day cassava all day cassava all day you wouldn't get enough protein but you you wouldn't get enough protein but you you wouldn't get enough protein but you also wouldn't get a lot also wouldn't get a lot also wouldn't get a lot you also wouldn't get enough of other you also wouldn't get enough of other you also wouldn't get enough of other nutrients so let me tell you how people nutrients so let me tell you how people nutrients so let me tell you how people figured out how to get enough protein figured out how to get enough protein figured out how to get enough protein this is disgusting are you ready this is disgusting are you ready this is disgusting are you ready so I got yeah we're ready so I got yeah we're ready so I got yeah we're ready I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in California California California and they were one of the sites that did and they were one of the sites that did and they were one of the sites that did some of the initial trials in the 50s some of the initial trials in the 50s some of the initial trials in the 50s 60s to establish this and the fifth 60s to establish this and the fifth 60s to establish this and the fifth floor of my building Morgan Hall in floor of my building Morgan Hall in floor of my building Morgan Hall in Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we got human subjects that were got human subjects that were got human subjects that were conscientious objectives to the Vietnam conscientious objectives to the Vietnam conscientious objectives to the Vietnam War War War and they volunteered to live up there in and they volunteered to live up there in and they volunteered to live up there in blue zoot suits and the scientists would blue zoot suits and the scientists would blue zoot suits and the scientists would sequentially lower their proteins sequentially lower their proteins sequentially lower their proteins successfully successively down to zero successfully successively down to zero successfully successively down to zero and give them just carbs and fats and and give them just carbs and fats and and give them just carbs and fats and then they would raise the protein back then they would raise the protein back then they would raise the protein back up slowly in their diet and every single up slowly in their diet and every single up slowly in their diet and every single day day day they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would vacuum it for all the hair they would vacuum it for all the hair they would vacuum it for all the hair and skin cells that sloughed off during and skin cells that sloughed off during and skin cells that sloughed off during the day they would collect all the poop the day they would collect all the poop the day they would collect all the poop all the pee all the nose blowings all the pee all the nose blowings all the pee all the nose blowings anything that left the human body anything that left the human body anything that left the human body was collected now we already talked was collected now we already talked was collected now we already talked about this nitrogen thing in protein and about this nitrogen thing in protein and about this nitrogen thing in protein and the initial studies were interestingly the initial studies were interestingly the initial studies were interestingly called called called nitrogen balance studies and instead of nitrogen balance studies and instead of nitrogen balance studies and instead of like analyzing amino acids in poop like analyzing amino acids in poop like analyzing amino acids in poop analyzing amino acids in P analyzing analyzing amino acids in P analyzing analyzing amino acids in P analyzing amino acids in hair you just burn it all amino acids in hair you just burn it all amino acids in hair you just burn it all up and analyze the nitrogen up and analyze the nitrogen up and analyze the nitrogen that's how much protein you can that's how much protein you can that's how much protein you can calculate how much protein left your calculate how much protein left your calculate how much protein left your body and then because they were body and then because they were body and then because they were nutrition scientists they were nutrition scientists they were nutrition scientists they were calculating the amount of protein or calculating the amount of protein or calculating the amount of protein or nitrogen going into the body from food nitrogen going into the body from food nitrogen going into the body from food so they knew how much is going in and so they knew how much is going in and so they knew how much is going in and how much is going out how much is going out how much is going out they raised and lowered it for each they raised and lowered it for each they raised and lowered it for each individual individual individual until they were in Balance but Jonathan until they were in Balance but Jonathan until they were in Balance but Jonathan when they did this for a bunch of people when they did this for a bunch of people when they did this for a bunch of people as you might imagine what they found out as you might imagine what they found out as you might imagine what they found out is oh my God this person in the room is oh my God this person in the room is oh my God this person in the room needed more than that person in the room needed more than that person in the room needed more than that person in the room and when they combined their data with a and when they combined their data with a and when they combined their data with a bunch of other folks who had done the bunch of other folks who had done the bunch of other folks who had done the same disgusting thing they came up with same disgusting thing they came up with same disgusting thing they came up with in math get ready for this a normal in math get ready for this a normal in math get ready for this a normal distribution curve which means ah a distribution curve which means ah a distribution curve which means ah a couple people needed very little a couple people needed very little a couple people needed very little a couple people needed a lot there's a couple people needed a lot there's a couple people needed a lot there's a bell curve so there was an average in bell curve so there was an average in bell curve so there was an average in the middle they did arrive at what would the middle they did arrive at what would the middle they did arrive at what would be the average be the average be the average okay and it's called the ear it's very okay and it's called the ear it's very okay and it's called the ear it's very specific in this huge nutrition book the specific in this huge nutrition book the specific in this huge nutrition book the estimated average requirement now here's estimated average requirement now here's estimated average requirement now here's an important question for you to think an important question for you to think an important question for you to think about when you want to come up with about when you want to come up with about when you want to come up with protein recommendations for the country protein recommendations for the country protein recommendations for the country what would you suggest recommending what would you suggest recommending what would you suggest recommending would you recommend would you recommend would you recommend the estimated average requirement the estimated average requirement the estimated average requirement because if everyone in the country got because if everyone in the country got because if everyone in the country got exactly the estimated average exactly the estimated average exactly the estimated average requirement requirement requirement by definition how many people would be by definition how many people would be by definition how many people would be deficient deficient deficient half half half because it's the average amount because it's the average amount because it's the average amount if you only get the average amount that if you only get the average amount that if you only get the average amount that half of you that are above average not half of you that are above average not half of you that are above average not just intelligently but from protein just intelligently but from protein just intelligently but from protein requirement requirement requirement would be deficient and so this happens would be deficient and so this happens would be deficient and so this happens in protein and all the vitamins and in protein and all the vitamins and in protein and all the vitamins and minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes up with recommended daily allowances for up with recommended daily allowances for up with recommended daily allowances for protein vitamins and minerals protein vitamins and minerals protein vitamins and minerals the standard approach is to take two the standard approach is to take two the standard approach is to take two standard deviations above the average standard deviations above the average standard deviations above the average and in mathematical terms that means and in mathematical terms that means and in mathematical terms that means you've picked a number you've picked a number you've picked a number that should be adequate for 97 and a that should be adequate for 97 and a that should be adequate for 97 and a half percent of the population and there half percent of the population and there half percent of the population and there might be a couple people in the tail might be a couple people in the tail might be a couple people in the tail that need even higher than that but it that need even higher than that but it that need even higher than that but it would be so few that you're pretty safe would be so few that you're pretty safe would be so few that you're pretty safe recommending that amount now not only is recommending that amount now not only is recommending that amount now not only is that mount that mount that mount adequate adequate adequate but another math thing to keep in mind but another math thing to keep in mind but another math thing to keep in mind here is if really everybody in the U.S here is if really everybody in the U.S here is if really everybody in the U.S or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 and a half percent and a half percent and a half percent two standard deviations higher how many two standard deviations higher how many two standard deviations higher how many would be exceeding their requirement would be exceeding their requirement would be exceeding their requirement oh actually like 97 percent oh actually like 97 percent oh actually like 97 percent so just just to make sure I'm with you so just just to make sure I'm with you so just just to make sure I'm with you here Christopher because you know this here Christopher because you know this here Christopher because you know this is uh you're moving at some some pace is uh you're moving at some some pace is uh you're moving at some some pace you're basically saying that when they you're basically saying that when they you're basically saying that when they came up with a recommended amount for came up with a recommended amount for came up with a recommended amount for protein they basically picked then the protein they basically picked then the protein they basically picked then the amount they make sure that almost nobody amount they make sure that almost nobody amount they make sure that almost nobody would have too little and as a result would have too little and as a result would have too little and as a result you know this recommended daily amount you know this recommended daily amount you know this recommended daily amount which I've definitely heard from which I've definitely heard from which I've definitely heard from vitamins right and supplements you hear vitamins right and supplements you hear vitamins right and supplements you hear that very often but I think anytime you that very often but I think anytime you that very often but I think anytime you look on the back of a food label again look on the back of a food label again look on the back of a food label again you know I've definitely seen that for you know I've definitely seen that for you know I've definitely seen that for almost everything almost everything almost everything it's actually the amount that means it's actually the amount that means it's actually the amount that means almost everybody needs less than that almost everybody needs less than that almost everybody needs less than that yes and so if you're getting the yes and so if you're getting the yes and so if you're getting the recommended daily amount you don't need recommended daily amount you don't need recommended daily amount you don't need to worry that you're not getting enough to worry that you're not getting enough to worry that you're not getting enough actually in a sense you might you're actually in a sense you might you're actually in a sense you might you're getting more than you need for almost getting more than you need for almost getting more than you need for almost everybody is so where does this take us everybody is so where does this take us everybody is so where does this take us okay and so what that takes us to is okay and so what that takes us to is okay and so what that takes us to is they came up with a number that said 0.8 they came up with a number that said 0.8 they came up with a number that said 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body grams of protein per kilogram of body grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should meet that and so I have a weight should meet that and so I have a weight should meet that and so I have a graph and a table that I can't show you graph and a table that I can't show you graph and a table that I can't show you because we have a podcast here but for a because we have a podcast here but for a because we have a podcast here but for a lot of people that RDA level would be lot of people that RDA level would be lot of people that RDA level would be maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of protein if if you're heavier uh so I protein if if you're heavier uh so I protein if if you're heavier uh so I have some U.S data that shows how much have some U.S data that shows how much have some U.S data that shows how much protein people eat in the U.S and it's protein people eat in the U.S and it's protein people eat in the U.S and it's pretty much double the ear or double the pretty much double the ear or double the pretty much double the ear or double the RDA RDA RDA just eating food not even trying and so just eating food not even trying and so just eating food not even trying and so to me it's sort of this American idea of to me it's sort of this American idea of to me it's sort of this American idea of god let's see that's what the RDA is but god let's see that's what the RDA is but god let's see that's what the RDA is but I know I'm above average so let me make I know I'm above average so let me make I know I'm above average so let me make sure I get some extra here it's like no sure I get some extra here it's like no sure I get some extra here it's like no you don't understand the concept it was you don't understand the concept it was you don't understand the concept it was built in to recognize that some people built in to recognize that some people built in to recognize that some people would need more would need more would need more and as a nutritionist when I teach and as a nutritionist when I teach and as a nutritionist when I teach students I have to say this is not an students I have to say this is not an students I have to say this is not an individual approach you should not look individual approach you should not look individual approach you should not look at the RDA to see if you are meeting at the RDA to see if you are meeting at the RDA to see if you are meeting your individual requirement this is a your individual requirement this is a your individual requirement this is a population health approach so that if population health approach so that if population health approach so that if everybody were to get that amount almost everybody were to get that amount almost everybody were to get that amount almost no one no one no one would be deficient and just as you were would be deficient and just as you were would be deficient and just as you were a bit surprised every time I tell that a bit surprised every time I tell that a bit surprised every time I tell that story the audience I explain it to story the audience I explain it to story the audience I explain it to is a little surprise is a little surprise is a little surprise and so Christopher you know I am and so Christopher you know I am and so Christopher you know I am surprised because I've had this surprised because I've had this surprised because I've had this experience and I suspect there's quite a experience and I suspect there's quite a experience and I suspect there's quite a lot of people who've had this experience lot of people who've had this experience lot of people who've had this experience so like the first time I ever went to uh so like the first time I ever went to uh so like the first time I ever went to uh a gym which is about 10 years ago and a gym which is about 10 years ago and a gym which is about 10 years ago and um I had a trainer say you know this is um I had a trainer say you know this is um I had a trainer say you know this is what you need to do in order to get what you need to do in order to get what you need to do in order to get healthier which is what I was interested healthier which is what I was interested healthier which is what I was interested in and fitter well the first thing you in and fitter well the first thing you in and fitter well the first thing you said is oh well you need to eat more said is oh well you need to eat more said is oh well you need to eat more protein and you need to eat at least a protein and you need to eat at least a protein and you need to eat at least a gram per kilogram of gram per kilogram of gram per kilogram of um of protein if you're going to get you um of protein if you're going to get you um of protein if you're going to get you know any benefits out of the work that know any benefits out of the work that know any benefits out of the work that you're going to do at the gym now that you're going to do at the gym now that you're going to do at the gym now that number because I think you just said it number because I think you just said it number because I think you just said it was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your recommended amount which is like the recommended amount which is like the recommended amount which is like the maximum that anyone in the world maximum that anyone in the world maximum that anyone in the world basically needs basically needs basically needs um um um how did this happen why is there there how did this happen why is there there how did this happen why is there there this controversy help me to understand this controversy help me to understand this controversy help me to understand why there's this pressure about why there's this pressure about why there's this pressure about feeling people need to eat more protein feeling people need to eat more protein feeling people need to eat more protein sure okay so let's think about that word sure okay so let's think about that word sure okay so let's think about that word so there is there are some flaws with so there is there are some flaws with so there is there are some flaws with this nitrogen balance study that I this nitrogen balance study that I this nitrogen balance study that I suggested and so what happens in at suggested and so what happens in at suggested and so what happens in at least the US from all the databases I least the US from all the databases I least the US from all the databases I have is have is have is this is this is very consistent in all this is this is very consistent in all this is this is very consistent in all research studies that I look at research studies that I look at research studies that I look at most people get about 16 17 18 of their most people get about 16 17 18 of their most people get about 16 17 18 of their calories from protein it's so consistent calories from protein it's so consistent calories from protein it's so consistent it's just amazing it's just amazing it's just amazing and then you look at how many calories and then you look at how many calories and then you look at how many calories you eat to maintain your weight and you eat to maintain your weight and you eat to maintain your weight and let's not go down this rabbit hole but let's not go down this rabbit hole but let's not go down this rabbit hole but most people underestimate how many most people underestimate how many most people underestimate how many calories they eat the data I have says calories they eat the data I have says calories they eat the data I have says women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men eat three thousand and I know a lot of eat three thousand and I know a lot of eat three thousand and I know a lot of your listeners are going to say not me I your listeners are going to say not me I your listeners are going to say not me I only eat 1500 calories a day we've done only eat 1500 calories a day we've done only eat 1500 calories a day we've done feeding studies where we gave people a feeding studies where we gave people a feeding studies where we gave people a certain amount of calories certain amount of calories certain amount of calories and it's really two thousand twenty five and it's really two thousand twenty five and it's really two thousand twenty five hundred or three thousand if you take 16 hundred or three thousand if you take 16 hundred or three thousand if you take 16 17 18 percent 17 18 percent 17 18 percent of those numbers of those numbers of those numbers people tend to get about 1.5 grams of people tend to get about 1.5 grams of people tend to get about 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram body weight without protein per kilogram body weight without protein per kilogram body weight without trying trying trying they're they're pretty much getting they're they're pretty much getting they're they're pretty much getting double the RDA so now here's what double the RDA so now here's what double the RDA so now here's what happens if you're in the gym getting happens if you're in the gym getting happens if you're in the gym getting that double the RDA right okay so it's that double the RDA right okay so it's that double the RDA right okay so it's probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met your need for enzymes hormones your need for enzymes hormones your need for enzymes hormones fingernails and hair fingernails and hair fingernails and hair you went to the gym to lift weights and you went to the gym to lift weights and you went to the gym to lift weights and gain muscle so you probably want more gain muscle so you probably want more gain muscle so you probably want more than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day so you can put muscle on so you can put muscle on so you can put muscle on okay so let me tell you let me tell you okay so let me tell you let me tell you okay so let me tell you let me tell you how many extra grams of protein you need how many extra grams of protein you need how many extra grams of protein you need so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure muscle in one year would that be pretty muscle in one year would that be pretty muscle in one year would that be pretty good that that I have to say it sounds good that that I have to say it sounds good that that I have to say it sounds quite ambitious I think if anybody saw quite ambitious I think if anybody saw quite ambitious I think if anybody saw me they would say totally ridiculous and me they would say totally ridiculous and me they would say totally ridiculous and impossible but let's go with ambitious impossible but let's go with ambitious impossible but let's go with ambitious shall we shall we shall we okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually 70 of your muscle is water 70 of your muscle is water 70 of your muscle is water so if you were going to do that in a so if you were going to do that in a so if you were going to do that in a year all you'd actually have to year all you'd actually have to year all you'd actually have to accumulate is three kilos of extra amino accumulate is three kilos of extra amino accumulate is three kilos of extra amino acids or 3 000 grams acids or 3 000 grams acids or 3 000 grams of extra amino acids divide that into of extra amino acids divide that into of extra amino acids divide that into 365 days of the year and just roughly 365 days of the year and just roughly 365 days of the year and just roughly that means you would need an extra 10 that means you would need an extra 10 that means you would need an extra 10 grams of protein a day to keep retain in grams of protein a day to keep retain in grams of protein a day to keep retain in addition to meeting your maintenance addition to meeting your maintenance addition to meeting your maintenance needs to put this on now it's not quite needs to put this on now it's not quite needs to put this on now it's not quite a fair number because when you're in the a fair number because when you're in the a fair number because when you're in the gym lifting and working out if you're gym lifting and working out if you're gym lifting and working out if you're working out really hard you're actually working out really hard you're actually working out really hard you're actually breaking down some muscle using those breaking down some muscle using those breaking down some muscle using those amino acids and you have to replace them amino acids and you have to replace them amino acids and you have to replace them so put another 10 grams on that say you so put another 10 grams on that say you so put another 10 grams on that say you needed an extra 20 grams a day every day needed an extra 20 grams a day every day needed an extra 20 grams a day every day for a year for a year for a year to put this on in the U.S people are to put this on in the U.S people are to put this on in the U.S people are eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every day just eating food and one more tidbit day just eating food and one more tidbit day just eating food and one more tidbit I have here is when you're working out I have here is when you're working out I have here is when you're working out hard every day don't you eat more hard every day don't you eat more hard every day don't you eat more you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories I have a Stanford football player who's I have a Stanford football player who's I have a Stanford football player who's in one of the Rose Bowl games in one of the Rose Bowl games in one of the Rose Bowl games he was eating 5 000 calories a day he was eating 5 000 calories a day he was eating 5 000 calories a day because they work him so hard because they work him so hard because they work him so hard he was getting 260 grams of protein he was getting 260 grams of protein he was getting 260 grams of protein every day without trying he wasn't every day without trying he wasn't every day without trying he wasn't having shakes he was just having food having shakes he was just having food having shakes he was just having food so we we should go to like which foods so we we should go to like which foods so we we should go to like which foods have that protein but if we could go have that protein but if we could go have that protein but if we could go here I have one more place to go is well here I have one more place to go is well here I have one more place to go is well wait is that bad what if you actually wait is that bad what if you actually wait is that bad what if you actually got more protein got more protein got more protein then you need it what what would happen then you need it what what would happen then you need it what what would happen to all that extra will it kill you to to all that extra will it kill you to to all that extra will it kill you to have more protein what happens have more protein what happens have more protein what happens okay so but I want to go down a rabbit okay so but I want to go down a rabbit okay so but I want to go down a rabbit hole just for a minute for a fun hole just for a minute for a fun hole just for a minute for a fun exercise so think on an average day you exercise so think on an average day you exercise so think on an average day you probably eat more carbohydrates than you probably eat more carbohydrates than you probably eat more carbohydrates than you need and so once you've eaten some need and so once you've eaten some need and so once you've eaten some carbohydrate the first thing it says oh carbohydrate the first thing it says oh carbohydrate the first thing it says oh my God does my brain need it right now my God does my brain need it right now my God does my brain need it right now nope my brain's okay nope my brain's okay nope my brain's okay um do I does my do I my muscles need it um do I does my do I my muscles need it um do I does my do I my muscles need it now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan I'm just sitting here I don't really I'm just sitting here I don't really I'm just sitting here I don't really need my muscles okay well I have a need my muscles okay well I have a need my muscles okay well I have a storage Depot for my carbohydrate and storage Depot for my carbohydrate and storage Depot for my carbohydrate and it's called glycogen and there's some in it's called glycogen and there's some in it's called glycogen and there's some in my muscles and there's some in my liver my muscles and there's some in my liver my muscles and there's some in my liver so I will try to fill up my storage so I will try to fill up my storage so I will try to fill up my storage capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate so that I can have some later in the day so that I can have some later in the day so that I can have some later in the day and do you know how long it would take and do you know how long it would take and do you know how long it would take you to deplete all the storage you to deplete all the storage you to deplete all the storage carbohydrate in your body any idea do carbohydrate in your body any idea do carbohydrate in your body any idea do you are you a runner Jonathan actually I you are you a runner Jonathan actually I you are you a runner Jonathan actually I don't know this if you're a runner no don't know this if you're a runner no don't know this if you're a runner no I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair doing podcasts but tell me how long does doing podcasts but tell me how long does doing podcasts but tell me how long does it last for it last for it last for so I bet you've heard that marathon so I bet you've heard that marathon so I bet you've heard that marathon runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't have enough carbohydrate that basically have enough carbohydrate that basically have enough carbohydrate that basically means you've used up all the glycogen means you've used up all the glycogen means you've used up all the glycogen that you stored in your body it's only that you stored in your body it's only that you stored in your body it's only about a kilo about a kilo about a kilo okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so let's say you ate more fat calories for let's say you ate more fat calories for let's say you ate more fat calories for the day and you used it for various the day and you used it for various the day and you used it for various things and mostly you burned it for

in your jowls in the pads in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your fingers endless capacity to store fat fingers endless capacity to store fat fingers endless capacity to store fat would take you an incredibly long time would take you an incredibly long time would take you an incredibly long time to use up all the storage of fat that to use up all the storage of fat that to use up all the storage of fat that you have in your body so unlimited you have in your body so unlimited you have in your body so unlimited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store carbohydrate where capacity to store carbohydrate where capacity to store carbohydrate where could the extra protein go so your your could the extra protein go so your your could the extra protein go so your your trainer told you to do this trainer told you to do this trainer told you to do this you ate all that extra protein you ate all that extra protein you ate all that extra protein a few major enzymes you made your a few major enzymes you made your a few major enzymes you made your hormones you lifted your weights and it hormones you lifted your weights and it hormones you lifted your weights and it was a little more than you needed or was a little more than you needed or was a little more than you needed or maybe a lot more and you're going to bed maybe a lot more and you're going to bed maybe a lot more and you're going to bed tonight so where do you think you put it tonight so where do you think you put it tonight so where do you think you put it in your body is it in your spleen in in your body is it in your spleen in in your body is it in your spleen in your

storage where is my protein storage none every where is my protein storage none every where is my protein storage none every bit of it at the end of the day has the bit of it at the end of the day has the bit of it at the end of the day has the nitrogen taken off and it gets turned nitrogen taken off and it gets turned nitrogen taken off and it gets turned into carbs and fat you can't store into carbs and fat you can't store into carbs and fat you can't store protein in your body so the muscle heads protein in your body so the muscle heads protein in your body so the muscle heads who are having who are having who are having a lot of meat and regular meals and a a lot of meat and regular meals and a a lot of meat and regular meals and a protein shake and a protein bar protein shake and a protein bar protein shake and a protein bar are turning all that into carbs and fats are turning all that into carbs and fats are turning all that into carbs and fats at the end of the day and I'm just going at the end of the day and I'm just going at the end of the day and I'm just going to turn it into basically fat that I lay to turn it into basically fat that I lay to turn it into basically fat that I lay down on my body is that what you're down on my body is that what you're down on my body is that what you're telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be taken off your liver will turn it into taken off your liver will turn it into taken off your liver will turn it into ammonia and your kidney will excrete it ammonia and your kidney will excrete it ammonia and your kidney will excrete it and get it out of your body and so you and get it out of your body and so you and get it out of your body and so you actually could suck out some calcium as actually could suck out some calcium as actually could suck out some calcium as it goes and so some people say don't eat it goes and so some people say don't eat it goes and so some people say don't eat too much protein it'll suck the calcium too much protein it'll suck the calcium too much protein it'll suck the calcium out of your bones let's not go down that out of your bones let's not go down that out of your bones let's not go down that rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen most people with a healthy kidney can most people with a healthy kidney can most people with a healthy kidney can eliminate this just fine you you might eliminate this just fine you you might eliminate this just fine you you might know that if someone has an impaired know that if someone has an impaired know that if someone has an impaired kidney one of the first things they do kidney one of the first things they do kidney one of the first things they do from a dietary perspective is they ask from a dietary perspective is they ask from a dietary perspective is they ask them to limit their protein them to limit their protein them to limit their protein because they don't want their their because they don't want their their because they don't want their their impaired kidney to face the challenge of impaired kidney to face the challenge of impaired kidney to face the challenge of clearing more of this excess ammonia clearing more of this excess ammonia clearing more of this excess ammonia from the excess protein from the excess protein from the excess protein that most people get in a day but to be that most people get in a day but to be that most people get in a day but to be honest most people's bodies are set up honest most people's bodies are set up honest most people's bodies are set up to handle this to handle this to handle this turn it into carbon fat and get rid of turn it into carbon fat and get rid of turn it into carbon fat and get rid of the ammonia for so for most people the ammonia for so for most people the ammonia for so for most people eating that protein eating that protein eating that protein isn't necessarily bad for you unless you isn't necessarily bad for you unless you isn't necessarily bad for you unless you consider consider consider what came with it so if this is what I what came with it so if this is what I what came with it so if this is what I was supposed to say isn't this like a I was supposed to say isn't this like a I was supposed to say isn't this like a I feel like this is a huge scam so feel like this is a huge scam so feel like this is a huge scam so basically there are all these products basically there are all these products basically there are all these products that are on sale that say you know no that are on sale that say you know no that are on sale that say you know no carbs 10 grams of protein or you know carbs 10 grams of protein or you know carbs 10 grams of protein or you know like no sugar 10 grams of protein and like no sugar 10 grams of protein and like no sugar 10 grams of protein and then you're telling me I eat it I then you're telling me I eat it I then you're telling me I eat it I haven't I'm already eating more protein haven't I'm already eating more protein haven't I'm already eating more protein than I need so my body is just going to than I need so my body is just going to than I need so my body is just going to turn that turn that turn that into carbs and fat and since I we know I into carbs and fat and since I we know I into carbs and fat and since I we know I already am eating as much food as I need already am eating as much food as I need already am eating as much food as I need like if I'm having that on top I'm just like if I'm having that on top I'm just like if I'm having that on top I'm just basically going to turn it into body fat basically going to turn it into body fat basically going to turn it into body fat is that have I got that right and so in is that have I got that right and so in is that have I got that right and so in the end it all comes down to calories so the end it all comes down to calories so the end it all comes down to calories so Jonathan we just finished a fun little Jonathan we just finished a

sent me saying the month that someone sent me saying the month that someone sent me saying the same thing and Stu Phillips who's a same thing and Stu Phillips who's a same thing and Stu Phillips who's a fantastic exercise guy from McMaster fantastic exercise guy from McMaster fantastic exercise guy from McMaster University he and I did a podcast University he and I did a podcast University he and I did a podcast together together together and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per kilogram number isn't right it should be kilogram number isn't right it should be kilogram number isn't right it should be higher than that it it may need to be as higher than that it it may need to be as higher than that it it may need to be as high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that what people eat anyway he said well yeah what people eat anyway he said well yeah what people eat anyway he said well yeah that's actually what they get anyway so that's actually what they get anyway so that's actually what they get anyway so if you weren't getting that much it's if you weren't getting that much it's if you weren't getting that much it's possible you could be impaired and you possible you could be impaired and you possible you could be impaired and you would benefit from this but if you were would benefit from this but if you were would benefit from this but if you were tracking your calories right tracking your calories right tracking your

take any extra effort to get that amount of any extra effort to get that amount of any extra effort to get that amount of protein protein protein Christopher I think that's yeah it's Christopher I think that's yeah it's Christopher I think that's yeah it's very clear it's sort of amazing I do very clear it's sort of amazing I do very clear it's sort of amazing I do want however to spend a little bit of want however to spend a little bit of want however to spend a little bit of time talking through sort of the the time talking through sort of the the time talking through sort of the the different ages of people because we had different ages of people because we had different ages of people because we had so many questions on social from our so many questions on social from our so many questions on social from our listeners about concerns about protein listeners about concerns about protein listeners about concerns about protein requirements at different ages so I requirements at different ages so I requirements at different ages so I would love to start actually maybe with would love to start actually maybe with would love to start actually maybe with children children children um and I just have this sort of personal um and I just have this sort of personal um and I just have this sort of personal experience right now so I have a 15 year experience right now so I have a 15 year experience right now so I have a 15 year old and his friends have started old and his friends have started old and his friends have started drinking these new energy drinks that drinking these new energy drinks that drinking these new energy drinks that say they have added protein which is a say they have added protein which is a say they have added protein which is a new thing for me that wasn't what I you new thing for me that wasn't what I you new thing for me that wasn't what I you know I wasn't even aware that that was know I wasn't even aware that that was know I wasn't even aware that that was the that that was a a thing they've gone the that that was a a thing they've gone the that that was a a thing they've gone past caffeine is there any evidence that past caffeine is there any evidence that past caffeine is there any evidence that at this point when you're growing really at this point when you're growing really at this point when you're growing really fast that actually kids might not be fast that actually kids might not be fast that actually kids might not be getting enough protein and we need to getting enough protein and we need to getting enough protein and we need to really worry about that really worry about that really worry about that yep so for kids if you go back to all yep so for kids if you go back to all yep so for kids if you go back to all those old RDA calculations those old RDA calculations those old RDA calculations kids need not 0.8 grams but at different kids need not 0.8 grams but at different kids need not 0.8 grams but at different ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 because they're growing because they're growing because they're growing similarly for a pregnant woman that's similarly for a pregnant woman that's similarly for a pregnant woman that's growing a fetus inside of her she's not growing a fetus inside of her she's not growing a fetus inside of her she's not just maintaining she's growing just maintaining she's growing just maintaining she's growing and so those needs are higher than 0.8 and so those needs are higher than 0.8 and so those needs are higher than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day the question grams per kilogram per day the question grams per kilogram per day the question is can you get that just eating food or is can you get that just eating food or is can you get that just eating food or do you need to get these extra sources do you need to get these extra sources do you need to get these extra sources and as as I'm suggesting the food supply and as as I'm suggesting the food supply and as as I'm suggesting the food supply as long as you get a reasonable variety as long as you get a reasonable variety as long as you get a reasonable variety and we should get into plant food versus and we should get into plant food versus and we should get into plant food versus animal food but you would have to work animal food but you would have to work animal food but you would have to work really hard not to get that much protein really hard not to get that much protein really hard not to get that much protein Jonathan I attended the job talk of a Jonathan I attended the job talk of a Jonathan I attended the job talk of a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nutrition person said God you know I'm nutrition person said God you know I'm nutrition person said God you know I'm trying to work with these people with trying to work with these people with trying to work with these people with impaired kidneys and I've been trying to impaired kidneys and I've been trying to impaired kidneys and I've been trying to get them on this really severely get them on this really severely get them on this really severely restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per kilogram body weight and I I can't get kilogram body weight and I I can't get kilogram body weight and I I can't get them there them there them there and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per kilogram it's severely restricted kilogram it's severely restricted kilogram it's severely restricted protein protein protein that's practically the RDA he said yeah that's practically the RDA he said yeah that's practically the RDA he said yeah I can't get them that low I get them to I can't get them that low I get them to I can't get them that low I get them to try to eat this and that and then I try to eat this and that and then I try to eat this and that and then I can't get them that low can't get them that low can't get them that low it's hard not to get it and so does that it's hard not to get it and so does that it's hard not to get it and so does that mean you know as a parent you know you mean you know as a parent you know you mean you know as a parent you know you don't really need to worry about it don't really need to worry about it don't really need to worry about it um but isn't your

very patient so Christopher you'd be very patient about not talking about where the about not talking about where the about not talking about where the protein comes from so thank you let's protein comes from so thank you let's protein comes from so thank you let's um do that and we had lots of people um do that and we had lots of people um do that and we had lots of people asking us basically you know sort of asking us basically you know sort of asking us basically you know sort of versions of the same question is animal versions of the same question is animal versions of the same question is animal protein better than plant protein and protein better than plant protein and protein better than plant protein and um you know how are they different you um you know how are they different you um you know how are they different you know and why is it that one might be know and why is it that one might be know and why is it that one might be better than the other better than the other better than the other yeah so you're killing me this is a yeah so you're killing me this is a yeah so you're killing me this is a podcast because I can't tell you how podcast because I can't tell you how podcast because I can't tell you how many hours I spent making slides showing many hours I spent making slides showing many hours I spent making slides showing different amino acids at this point different amino acids at this point different amino acids at this point really have to get down to that amino really have to get down to that amino really have to get down to that amino acid level and so I'm gonna do my best acid level and so I'm gonna do my best acid level and so I'm gonna do my best to describe some of these slides I made to describe some of these slides I made to describe some of these slides I made Jonathan so if you look at the estimated Jonathan so if you look at the estimated Jonathan so if you look at the estimated average requirement of protein for a lot average requirement of protein for a lot average requirement of protein for a lot of people it could be close to 40 grams of people it could be close to 40 grams of people it could be close to 40 grams of protein which is pretty low and I I of protein which is pretty low and I I of protein which is pretty low and I I like to use that number just for fun to like to use that number just for fun to like to use that number just for fun to make this one point there are 20 amino make this one point there are 20 amino make this one point there are 20 amino acids acids acids if you need 40 grams of protein if you need 40 grams of protein if you need 40 grams of protein simplistically that sounds like it would simplistically that sounds like it would simplistically that sounds like it would be good to have two grams of each one 2 be good to have two grams of each one 2 be good to have two grams of each one 2 times 20 is 40. times 20 is 40. times 20 is 40. not even close not even close not even close so you need tons of glutamate glutamine so you need tons of glutamate glutamine so you need tons of glutamate glutamine aspartate asparaging you need hardly any aspartate asparaging you need hardly any aspartate asparaging you need hardly any tryptophan methionine cysteine tryptophan methionine cysteine tryptophan methionine cysteine and the best way I've found to describe and the best way I've found to describe and the best way I've found to describe this is the game of Scrabble this is the game of Scrabble this is the game of Scrabble so Scrabble which my wife beats me at so Scrabble which my wife beats me at so Scrabble which my wife beats me at regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag and I don't know if you know this from and I don't know if you know this from and I don't know if you know this from one country to the other the one country to the other the one country to the other the distribution of letters is a little bit distribution of letters is a little bit distribution of letters is a little bit different depending on how often those different depending on how often those different depending on how often those letters are used in the language of that letters are used in the language of that letters are used in the language of that I'm learning about Scrabble and protein I'm learning about Scrabble and protein I'm learning about Scrabble and protein now Christopher said it's great so think now Christopher said it's great so think now Christopher said it's great so think 26 letters in the alphabet there's a 26 letters in the alphabet there's a 26 letters in the alphabet there's a hundred tiles aren't there four of each hundred tiles aren't there four of each hundred tiles aren't there four of each letter in the Scrabble bag to make your letter in the Scrabble bag to make your letter in the Scrabble bag to make your words no there's only one Z there's one words no there's only one Z there's one words no there's only one Z there's one X One J and there are a whole lot of E's X One J and there are a whole lot of E's X One J and there are a whole lot of E's and A's and n's and ours amino acids are and A's and n's and ours amino acids are and A's and n's and ours amino acids are just like that just like that just like that so what I did is I sort of made a graph so what I did is I sort of made a graph so what I did is I sort of made a graph and I showed ah here's the distribution and I showed ah here's the distribution and I showed ah here's the distribution of 40 grams of protein in eggs in of 40 grams of protein in eggs in of 40 grams of protein in eggs in chicken in pork in fish in beef and chicken in pork in fish in beef and chicken in pork in fish in beef and they're stun the distribution is they're stun the distribution is they're stun the distribution is stunningly stunningly stunningly similar they say wow that's that's similar they say wow that's that's similar they say wow that's that's pretty interesting all the animals have pretty interesting all the animals have pretty interesting all the animals have a lot of the same ones and a few of the a lot of the same ones and a few of the a lot of the same ones and a few of the same ones and then I say okay so you've same ones and then I say okay so you've same ones and then I say okay so you've all heard plants are missing amino acids all heard plants are missing amino acids all heard plants are missing amino acids which ones do you think they're missing which ones do you think they're missing which ones do you think they're missing are different plants missing different are different plants missing different are different plants missing different amino acids and I put up some fake data amino acids and I put up some fake data amino acids and I put up some fake data and I say which one do you think is rice and I say which one do you think is rice and I say which one do you think is rice and beans and broccoli and I I don't let and beans and broccoli and I I don't let and beans and broccoli and I I don't let them think for long and then I put up them think for long and then I put up them think for long and then I put up the actual amino acid distribution and the actual amino acid distribution and the actual amino acid distribution and their jaws drop their jaws drop their jaws drop all of the plants have all 20 amino all of the plants have all 20 amino all of the plants have all 20 amino acids the distribution of the amino acids the distribution of the amino acids the distribution of the amino acids is almost identical in the plants acids is almost identical in the plants acids is almost identical in the plants as the animal and they say what have as the animal and they say what have as the animal and they say what have been people telling me Professor Gardner been people telling me Professor Gardner been people telling me Professor Gardner are you lying did you like make this up are you lying did you like make this up are you lying did you like make this up because this this is not the reality because this this is not the reality because this this is not the reality that I've been told and it's a very that I've been told and it's a very that I've been told and it's a very simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so rice and other grains in general tend to rice and other grains in general tend to rice and other grains in general tend to be low in the proportion of Lysine that be low in the proportion of Lysine that be low in the proportion of Lysine that they have relative to the optimal they have relative to the optimal they have relative to the optimal proportion proportion proportion and likewise beans tend to be low in and likewise beans tend to be low in and likewise beans tend to be low in methionine and cysteine methionine and cysteine methionine and cysteine in proportion in proportion in proportion to what they need and so I like this to what they need and so I like this to what they need and so I like this Scrabble analogy so picture that you've Scrabble analogy so picture that you've Scrabble analogy so picture that you've had the Scrabble game for a really long had the Scrabble game for a really long had the Scrabble game for a really long time and you lost the L for lysine and time and you lost the L for lysine and time and you lost the L for lysine and the M for methionine the M for methionine the M for methionine are you missing all valves and all the are you missing all valves and all the are you missing all valves and all the M's no no actually you only lost a M's no no actually you only lost a M's no no actually you only lost a couple of the letters so if you were couple of the letters so if you were couple of the letters so if you were using your board and trying to make using your board and trying to make using your board and trying to make words you would run out of words you words you would run out of words you words you would run out of words you could make with l and m sooner could make with l and m sooner could make with l and m sooner what if you had a neighbor who also what if you had a neighbor who also what if you had a neighbor who also hadn't played Scrabble in a long time hadn't played Scrabble in a long time hadn't played Scrabble in a long time and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're missing those letters you can have my missing those letters you can have my missing those letters you can have my Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also missing an l and an M I'm sorry you missing an l and an M I'm sorry you missing an l and an M I'm sorry you could still fill up the L and the M that could still fill up the L and the M that could still fill up the L and the M that you were missing because your neighbor you were missing because your neighbor you were missing because your neighbor has extra L's and M's and I think has extra L's and M's and I think has extra L's and M's and I think Americans eat at least 80 grams of Americans eat at least 80 grams of Americans eat at least 80 grams of protein a day not 40 that they need protein a day not 40 that they need protein a day not 40 that they need and so I'm thinking what if you had two and so I'm thinking what if you had two and so I'm thinking what if you had two bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like what Americans eat in protein every day what Americans eat in protein every day what Americans eat in protein every day two bags of Scrabble letters and if two bags of Scrabble letters and if two bags of Scrabble letters and if they're eating plant proteins they are they're eating plant proteins they are they're eating plant proteins they are lower in lysine and methionine lower in lysine and methionine lower in lysine and methionine then would be optimal but that's only a then would be optimal but that's only a then would be optimal but that's only a concern if they only get 40 grams of concern if they only get 40 grams of concern if they only get 40 grams of protein and they need every amino acid protein and they need every amino acid protein and they need every amino acid to count but they get 80 grams of to count but they get 80 grams of to count but they get 80 grams of protein even the vegetarians and the protein even the vegetarians and the protein even the vegetarians and the vegans and Christopher just one vegans and Christopher just one vegans and Christopher just one clarifications I think that it sounds clarifications I think that it sounds clarifications I think that it sounds like a general saying don't worry about like a general saying don't worry about like a general saying don't worry about this are you saying because you're this are you saying because you're this are you saying because you're mentioning two particular amino acids mentioning two particular amino acids mentioning two particular amino acids that I can't pronounce that I can't pronounce that I can't pronounce um um um are you saying that in all plants the are you saying that in all plants the are you saying that in all plants the relative amount of that is lower than it relative amount of that is lower than it relative amount of that is lower than it is in animals is in animals is in animals um so even if you're having a variety of um so even if you're having a variety of um so even if you're having a variety of plants so it's not just that like one plants so it's not just that like one plants so it's not just that like one plant is low in the L and the other one plant is low in the L and the other one plant is low in the L and the other one is low and yeah I'm actually on average is low and yeah I'm actually on average is low and yeah I'm actually on average like all plants are lower in that like all plants are lower in that like all plants are lower in that relative to animals and therefore if you relative to animals and therefore if you relative to animals and therefore if you were eating a plant-only diet then if were eating a plant-only diet then if were eating a plant-only diet then if you were going to eat the 40 grams of you were going to eat the 40 grams of you were going to eat the 40 grams of protein you're going to have potentially protein you're going to have potentially protein you're going to have potentially a low level of those two particular a low level of those two particular a low level of those two particular amino acids I just want to make sure amino acids I just want to make sure amino acids I just want to make sure that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not really it's you need 40. you need 40 in really it's you need 40. you need 40 in really it's you need 40. you need 40 in the right distribution the right distribution the right distribution if you only ate rice all day that's how if you only ate rice all day that's how if you only ate rice all day that's how you got your 40 grams of protein you you got your 40 grams of protein you you got your 40 grams of protein you wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 total grams of protein you run out of total grams of protein you run out of total grams of protein you run out of Lysine too soon if you only ate beans Lysine too soon if you only ate beans Lysine too soon if you only ate beans you'd run out of methionine you'd run out of methionine you'd run out of methionine before you got enough so you could before you got enough so you could before you got enough so you could supplement with just those individual supplement with just those individual supplement with just those individual amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of protein a day protein a day protein a day and you would end up getting the things and you would end up getting the things and you would end up getting the things that you're missing now here's what that you're missing now here's what that you're missing now here's what happens is you really only needed 40 and happens is you really only needed 40 and happens is you really only needed 40 and you 880 you 880 you 880 what do you do with the extra 40 you what do you do with the extra 40 you what do you do with the extra 40 you break 40 down and turn it into break 40 down and turn it into break 40 down and turn it into carbohydrate and fat but that's carbohydrate and fat but that's carbohydrate and fat but that's typically what's happening typically what's happening typically what's happening is that people eat more than the total is that people eat more than the total is that people eat more than the total amount they need amount they need amount they need and so given that plants don't have the and so given that plants don't have the and so given that plants don't have the ideal distribution of the amino acids ideal distribution of the amino acids ideal distribution of the amino acids they're almost always covered they're almost always covered they're almost always covered and you just break down the other ones and you just break down the other ones and you just break down the other ones so there is Jonathan an old concept that so there is Jonathan an old concept that so there is Jonathan an old concept that was written up in Francis Moore Lopez was written up in Francis Moore Lopez was written up in Francis Moore Lopez died for a small planet about died for a small planet about died for a small planet about complementing your proteins because complementing your proteins because complementing your proteins because the grains that are a little low in the grains that are a little low in the grains that are a little low in lysine are a little high in methionine lysine are a little high in methionine lysine are a little high in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine but they're a little high in lysine I'm but they're a little high in lysine I'm but they're a little high in lysine I'm gonna say ah this is sort of a gonna say ah this is sort of a gonna say ah this is sort of a no-brainer that's why some populations no-brainer that's why some populations no-brainer that's why some populations ate grains and beans together ate grains and beans together ate grains and beans together because they complemented the because they complemented the because they complemented the deficiencies with the excesses and it's deficiencies with the excesses and it's deficiencies with the excesses and it's still never quite as good as meat it's still never quite as good as meat it's still never quite as good as meat it's still not the optimal distribution still not the optimal distribution still not the optimal distribution but it's closer to Optimal so you can but it's closer to Optimal so you can but it's closer to Optimal so you can either try to complement them or you either try to complement them or you either try to complement them or you cannot worry about it because you're cannot worry about it because you're cannot worry about it because you're probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't

quality and in the definition of protein quality and in the definition of protein quality and in it we said okay so there's this one it we said okay so there's this one it we said okay so there's this one issue of the distribution of amino acids issue of the distribution of amino acids issue of the distribution of amino acids perfect in animal Foods less than perfect in animal Foods less than perfect in animal Foods less than perfect in plant Foods there's actually perfect in plant Foods there's actually perfect in plant Foods there's actually an issue of digestion and availability an issue of digestion and availability an issue of digestion and availability bioavailability and it is a little bioavailability and it is a little bioavailability and it is a little higher for meat meat protein than plant higher for meat meat protein than plant higher for meat meat protein than plant protein but when people are eating Meats protein but when people are eating Meats protein but when people are eating Meats they're getting a lot of saturated fat they're getting a lot of saturated fat they're getting a lot of saturated fat and they're sometimes getting hormones and they're sometimes getting hormones and they're sometimes getting hormones and antibiotics were used to grow that and antibiotics were used to grow that and antibiotics were used to grow that meat and there's no fiber in there if meat and there's no fiber in there if meat and there's no fiber in there if you were eating beans and tofu and you were eating beans and tofu and you were eating beans and tofu and tempeh and plant Foods you'd be getting tempeh and plant Foods you'd be getting tempeh and plant Foods you'd be getting much less saturated fat you'd be getting much less saturated fat you'd be

lots of fiber for your getting lots of fiber for your microbiome you guys at Zoe might have microbiome you guys at Zoe might have microbiome you guys at Zoe might have heard about the microbiome that's pretty heard about the microbiome that's pretty heard about the microbiome that's pretty cool thing and so this idea of should cool thing and so this idea of should cool thing and so this idea of should the the protein quality definition in the the protein quality definition in the the protein quality definition in the U.S is based on amino acid the U.S is based on amino acid the U.S is based on amino acid distribution and digestion and distribution and digestion and distribution and digestion and availability and we propose that it availability and we propose that it availability and we propose that it should also include the nutrients that should also include the nutrients that should also include the nutrients that come with those foods rich in protein come with those foods rich in protein come with those foods rich in protein which in your bar with sugar which in your bar with sugar which in your bar with sugar and that meat with saturated fat and no and that meat with

yeah yeah yeah wonderful Christopher this has been an wonderful Christopher this has been an wonderful Christopher this has been an amazing tour uh I would love to try and amazing tour uh I would love to try and amazing tour uh I would love to try and do a little summary and then please keep do a little summary and then please keep do a little summary and then please keep me honest if I uh if I got anything me honest if I uh if I got anything me honest if I uh if I got anything wrong is that all right ready wrong is that all right ready wrong is that all right ready absolutely well absolutely well absolutely well um I think first you explained what is um I think first you explained what is um I think first you explained what is protein and what I took away from this protein and what I took away from this protein and what I took away from this is like fat and carbs are like the fuel is like fat and carbs are like the fuel is like fat and carbs are like the fuel that power us through the day but that power us through the day but that power us through the day but protein actually creates the structure protein actually creates the structure protein actually creates the structure so like everything we're made of so like everything we're made of so like everything we're made of basically comes from these these basically comes from these these basically comes from these these proteins and that they come from these proteins and that they come from these proteins and that they come from these 20 amino acids which I'd never 20 amino acids which I'd never 20 amino acids which I'd never understood what that was before but now understood what that was before but now understood what that was before but now I've got in mind they're sort of like I've got in mind they're sort of like I've got in mind they're sort of like the letters in the alphabet and then I'm the letters in the alphabet and then I'm the letters in the alphabet and then I'm like all these words that get created like all these words that get created like all these words that get created out of these these letters out of these these letters out of these these letters um um um in terms of how much protein we need the in terms of how much protein we need the in terms of how much protein we need the answer is far less than any of us answer is far less than any of us answer is far less than any of us realized or have been led to believe uh realized or have been led to believe uh realized or have been led to believe uh your colleagues at Stanford you know a your colleagues at Stanford you know a your colleagues at Stanford you know a long time ago did these crazy studies of long time ago did these crazy studies of long time ago did these crazy studies of of people sort of wrapped up in suits to of people sort of wrapped up in suits to of people sort of wrapped up in suits to understand exactly how much uh they understand exactly how much uh they understand exactly how much uh they needed and it turns out there's a lot of needed and it turns out there's a lot of needed and it turns out there's a lot of variation between people variation between people variation between people um and I'd love to figure out how we um and I'd love to figure out how we um and I'd love to figure out how we might be able to measure that at home might be able to measure that at home might be able to measure that at home somehow in the future but at the moment somehow in the future but at the moment somehow in the future but at the moment we can't Christopher's shaking his head we can't Christopher's shaking his head we can't Christopher's shaking his head there's always some new technology I there's always some new technology I there's always some new technology I feel but maybe that will make it happen feel but maybe that will make it happen feel but maybe that will make it happen but at the moment you can't measure that but at the moment you can't measure that but at the moment you can't measure that for yourself but what they did is they for yourself but what they did is they for yourself but what they did is they figured out sort of what's the maximum figured out sort of what's the maximum figured out sort of what's the maximum that almost anybody needs and that was that almost anybody needs and that was that almost anybody needs and that was actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and on average in the US people are eating on average in the US people are eating on average in the US people are eating double that double that double that um uh already which means that they're um uh already which means that they're um uh already which means that they're eating you know far far more in fact eating you know far far more in fact eating you know far far more in fact than they need so they don't need to than they need so they don't need to than they need so they don't need to worry about it and then we talked about worry about it and then we talked about worry about it and then we talked about well what about if you're not eating well what about if you're not eating well what about if you're not eating lots and lots of animal protein you know lots and lots of animal protein you know lots and lots of animal protein you know is that a problem and the answer was is that a problem and the answer was is that a problem and the answer was really not that actually there are all really not that actually there are all really not that actually there are all the amino acids in Plants there are a the amino acids in Plants there are a the amino acids in Plants there are a couple of these amino acids which have couple of these amino acids which have couple of these amino acids which have lower amounts relatively but since we're lower amounts relatively but since we're lower amounts relatively but since we're all eating so much of it it's not really all eating so much of it it's not really all eating so much of it it's not really a problem and I think the final point a problem and I think the final point a problem and I think the final point was almost anything that says like extra was almost anything that says like extra was almost anything that says like extra high protein on it or you know a bar or high protein on it or you know a bar or high protein on it or you know a bar or a shake or any of these things are just a shake or any of these things are just a shake or any of these things are just really bad for you don't eat them and I really bad for you don't eat them and I really bad for you don't eat them and I think Christopher your messages eat think Christopher your messages eat think Christopher your messages eat beans instead beans instead beans instead yep perfect I don't know why it took me yep perfect I don't know why it took me yep perfect I don't know why it took me an hour to say all that when you just an hour to say all that when you just an hour to say all that when you just said it in three minutes which is pretty said it in three minutes which is pretty said it in three minutes which is pretty good well there one critical mistake so good well there one critical mistake so good well there one critical mistake so those those old studies in the blue those those old studies in the blue those those old studies in the blue suits were Berkeley my alma mater not suits were Berkeley my alma mater not suits were Berkeley my alma mater not Stanford my current place and you know Stanford my current place and you know Stanford my current

the consumption of plants not animals of plants not animals of plants not animals now as you keep in mind evidently when now as you keep in mind evidently when now as you keep in mind evidently when we see data especially observational we see data especially observational we see data especially observational data in human populations comparing the data in human populations comparing the data in human populations comparing the consumption of animal food with some consumption of animal food with some consumption of animal food with some kind of disease outcome we should keep kind of disease outcome we should keep kind of disease outcome we should keep in mind that as animal food consumption in mind that as animal food consumption in mind that as animal food consumption increases are the percentage of the diet increases are the percentage of the diet increases are the percentage of the diet plant food goes down so when we see a plant food goes down so when we see a plant food goes down so when we see a relationship with animal protein also relationship with animal protein also relationship with animal protein also showing it in a little bit showing it in a little bit showing it in a little bit that tends to reflect also a decrease in that tends to reflect also a decrease in that tends to reflect also a decrease in consumption of plant foods which have a consumption of plant foods which have a consumption of plant foods which have a lot of wonderful antioxidants and other lot of wonderful antioxidants and other lot of wonderful antioxidants and other substances to prevent disease substances to prevent disease substances to prevent disease you know this is uh when I was going up you know this is uh when I was going up you know this is uh when I was going up on the farm this is what I sort of on the farm this is what I sort of on the farm this is what I sort of learned and most people sort of accepted learned and most people sort of accepted learned and most people sort of accepted this is almost the ideal of North and this is almost the ideal of North and this is almost the ideal of North and diet diet diet quite frankly though we consume this quite frankly though we consume this quite frankly though we consume this food was without knowing it it's almost food was without knowing it it's almost food was without knowing it it's almost unconscious if you will we consume it unconscious if you will we consume it unconscious if you will we consume it because we want to make sure we get because we want to make sure we get because we want to make sure we get enough protein enough protein enough protein I'm going to argue that the protein in I'm going to argue that the protein in I'm going to argue that the protein in animal food animal food animal food uh basically is is so prominent we don't uh basically is is so prominent we don't uh basically is is so prominent we don't even hardly thinking we just take it for even hardly thinking we just

going on that as conversation that's now going on that as conversation that's now going on that as I see it uh primarily is how are we I see it uh primarily is how are we I see it uh primarily is how are we going to meet the demand for production going to meet the demand for production going to meet the demand for production of more animal food presumably because of more animal food presumably because of more animal food presumably because it's so important that's our state it's so important that's our state it's so important that's our state repairs today repairs today repairs today now

because they weren't getting enough because they weren't getting enough because they weren't getting enough protein so I'm schooled in this idea protein so I'm schooled in this idea protein so I'm schooled in this idea that the more protein the better that the more protein the better that the more protein the better however I saw something in the children however I saw something in the children however I saw something in the children that didn't exactly square with that that didn't exactly square with that that didn't exactly square with that presumption that bias I should say presumption that bias I should say presumption that bias I should say namely I was told by my medical namely I was told by my medical namely I was told by my medical colleagues one day in the Philippines colleagues one day in the Philippines colleagues one day in the Philippines when we were there when we were there when we were there that they were operating some children that they were operating some children that they were operating some children four years of age and younger for liver four years of age and younger for liver four years of age and younger for liver cancer that is really odd I went back to cancer that is really odd I went back to cancer that is really odd I went back to look at some of the nutritional data we look at some of the nutritional data we look at some of the nutritional data we had got the impression that the children had got the impression that the children had got the impression that the children were likely to get the liver cancer were were likely to get the liver cancer were were likely to get the liver cancer were the ones consuming the what were the the ones consuming the what were the the ones consuming the what were the ones from the families consuming the ones from the families consuming the ones from the families consuming the most protein pretty odd more protein most protein pretty odd more protein most protein pretty odd more protein more calcium same makes sense to me but more calcium same makes sense to me but more calcium same makes sense to me but in any case this study then came out in any case this study then came out in any case this study then came out from India now 54 years ago from India now 54 years ago from India now 54 years ago where they were also suggesting that if where they were also suggesting that if where they were also suggesting that if these children were to consume more these children were to consume more these children were to consume more protein they would have less liver protein they would have less liver protein they would have less liver cancer liver cancer is a big problem in cancer liver cancer is a big problem in cancer liver cancer is a big problem in Asia by the way Asia by the way Asia by the way so they did a little study with animals so they did a little study with animals so they did a little study with animals and they got these results animals given and they got these results animals given and they got these results animals given the higher levels of protein 20 percent the higher levels of protein 20 percent the higher levels of protein 20 percent are tall calories are tall calories are tall calories um compared to animals given the lower um compared to animals given the lower um compared to animals given the lower levels of five percent levels of five percent levels of five percent uh both of them both groups were uh both of them both groups were uh both of them both groups were initiated with a carcinogen so as we say initiated with a carcinogen so as we say initiated with a carcinogen so as we say in any case the animals given higher in any case the animals given higher in any case the animals given higher levels of protein they were the ones who levels of protein they were the ones who levels of protein they were the ones who got the cancer got the cancer got the cancer [Music] [Music] [Music] once given lower those did not exactly once given lower those did not exactly once given lower those did not exactly at this what they thought at this what they thought at this what they thought this coincided with some of the this coincided with some of the this coincided with some of the Impressions that I was getting with the Impressions that I was getting with the Impressions that I was getting with the children children children so led to this a really striking so led to this a really striking so led to this a really striking notion increasing protein increasing notion increasing protein increasing notion increasing protein increasing cancer sound crazy cancer sound crazy cancer sound crazy so I came back home to my laboratory at so I came back home to my laboratory at so I came back home to my laboratory at the Virginia Tech and got some money the Virginia Tech and got some money the Virginia Tech and got some money from the NIH a grant that continued to from the NIH a grant that continued to from the NIH a grant that continued to the next 27 years ago well we had a the next 27 years ago well we had a the next 27 years ago well we had a chance to really ask that question chance to really ask that question chance to really ask that question is it possible that animal protein could is it possible that animal protein could is it possible that animal protein could increase cancer and I could just show increase cancer and I could just show increase cancer and I could just show you a ton of studies but I'm going to you a ton of studies but I'm going to you a ton of studies but I'm going to just focus on one for to to because it just focus on one for to to because it just focus on one for to to because it really really really convinced me that there's something here convinced me that there's something here convinced me that there's something here I mean I was inclined to really doubt I mean I was inclined to really doubt I mean I was inclined to really doubt this but we did this I want to show you this but we did this I want to show you this but we did this I want to show you what we did what we did what we did this is the growth of in animals this is the growth of in animals this is the growth of in animals experimental rats this is the growth of experimental rats this is the growth of experimental rats this is the growth of cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 weeks weeks weeks animals fed 20 protein with the Indian animals fed 20 protein with the Indian animals fed 20 protein with the Indian workers did and you can see it's one workers did and you can see it's one workers did and you can see it's one brother well animals give it five brother well animals give it five brother well animals give it five percent did not let me write there is it percent did not let me write there is it percent did not let me write there is it was affirmation and as I said what the was affirmation and as I said what the was affirmation and as I said what the Indian workers have done if you will but Indian workers have done if you will but Indian workers have done if you will but then we did something more that was then we did something more that was then we did something more that was really striking really striking really striking I wanted to see what would happen if we I wanted to see what would happen if we I wanted to see what would happen if we switched the dice during that 12-week switched the dice during that 12-week switched the dice during that 12-week period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and vice versa this is just one vice versa this is just one vice versa this is just one representation of that representation of that representation of that and what results breaking we could and what results breaking we could and what results breaking we could control cancer development simply by control cancer development simply by control cancer development simply by adjusting this nutrient intake adjusting this nutrient intake adjusting this nutrient intake suggesting that nutrition might be suggesting that nutrition might be suggesting that nutrition might be important in controlling whether or not important in controlling whether or not important in controlling whether or not cancer works or not was really quite cancer works or not was really quite cancer works or not was really quite dramatic we did this kind of study in dramatic we did this kind of study in dramatic we did this kind of study in many different ways and I can tell you many different ways and I can tell you many different ways and I can tell you it's there it's true it's there it's true it's there it's true so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh at that time Now supported I think by at that time Now supported I think by at that time Now supported I think by more information namely a nutrition more information namely a nutrition more information namely a nutrition rather than genes controls cancer rather than genes controls cancer rather than genes controls cancer development uh what a revelation that development uh what a revelation that development uh what a revelation that was was was turned out is that not only that the turned out is that not only that the turned out is that not only that the protein we were using was animal-based protein we were using was animal-based protein we were using was animal-based it was small things it was protein of it was small things it was protein of it was small things it was protein of cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cows and and here casein was the one cows and and here casein was the one cows and and here casein was the one that was turning the cancer on that was turning the cancer on that was turning the cancer on a little bit later we tried to see what a little bit later we tried to see what a little bit later we tried to see what not so plant proteins like soy and we not so plant proteins like soy and we not so plant proteins like soy and we could do that didn't Infuse experiments could do that didn't Infuse experiments could do that didn't Infuse experiments on that different students were involved on that different students were involved on that different students were involved in it and sodium protein does not in it and sodium protein does not in it and sodium protein does not increase cancer development even when increase cancer development even when increase cancer development even when fed at the 20 level fed at the 20 level fed at the 20 level so it really puts a finger pointer at so it really puts a finger pointer at so it really puts a finger pointer at the finger right at animal protein as the finger right at animal protein as the finger right at animal protein as being the problem turning into cancer being the problem turning into cancer being the problem turning into cancer that being said it also seemed to apply that being said it also seemed to apply that being said it also seemed to apply to other animal proteins in general you to other animal proteins in general you to other animal proteins in general you know getting more into that in my second know getting more into that in my second know getting more into that in my second commentary but in any case if animal commentary but in any case if animal commentary but in any case if animal proteins cause cancer proteins cause cancer proteins cause cancer the notion occurred to me this is back the notion occurred to me this is back the notion occurred to me this is back in the 1980s in the 1980s in the 1980s the notion occurred to me that maybe the notion occurred to me that maybe the notion occurred to me that maybe this might apply to other diseases as this might apply to other diseases as this might apply to other diseases as well and similarly Betty plant Foods well and similarly Betty plant Foods well and similarly Betty plant Foods particular fruits is in this case that particular fruits is in this case that particular fruits is in this case that might tend to prevent that might tend to prevent that might tend to prevent that so with that in mind uh still not so with that in mind uh still not so with that in mind uh still not totally convinced that this animal totally convinced that this animal totally convinced that this animal protein affects what's Real uh I wanted protein affects what's Real uh I wanted protein affects what's Real uh I wanted to know what the mechanism was I spent to know what the mechanism was I spent to know what the mechanism was I spent the first 10 12 years of my career the first 10 12 years of my career the first 10 12 years of my career actually formally in as a professional actually formally in as a professional actually formally in as a professional in the pharmacology community in the pharmacology community in the pharmacology community uh you know all about drugs and how to uh you know all about drugs and how to uh you know all about drugs and how to use drugs and stuff like that so I'm use drugs and stuff like that so I'm use drugs and stuff like that so I'm very conscious was at that time of what very conscious was at that time of what very conscious was at that time of what drugs can do and here's here's the drugs can do and here's here's the drugs can do and here's here's the thought we tend to have in research of thought we tend to have in research of thought we tend to have in research of this kind this kind this kind if we see something we don't like animal if we see something we don't like animal if we see something we don't like animal protein causes cancer maybe we could protein causes cancer maybe we could protein causes cancer maybe we could find a mechanism for that effect that find a mechanism for that effect that find a mechanism for that effect that would lend itself to the development of would lend itself to the development of would lend itself to the development of a drug to block it there's something a drug to block it there's something a drug to block it there's something like statins being used about you know like statins being used about you know like statins being used about you know the the enzyme mechanism that is the the enzyme mechanism that is the the enzyme mechanism that is associated with heart disease so that associated with heart disease so that associated with heart disease so that was the thought maybe we could find the was the thought maybe we could find the was the thought maybe we could find the mechanism so we set about looking for mechanism so we set about looking for mechanism so we set about looking for mechanisms these studies went over a mechanisms these studies went over a mechanisms these studies went over a period went on over a period at least period went on over a period at least period went on over a period at least got 10 12 years or so got 10 12 years or so got 10 12 years or so and I kept looking for the mechanism and I kept looking for the mechanism and I kept looking for the mechanism they Mack Henderson that might account they Mack Henderson that might account they Mack Henderson that might account for this and and making those kind of for this and and making those kind of for this and and making those kind of studies we tended to in experimental studies we tended to in experimental studies we tended to in experimental cancer research we tended to think of cancer research we tended to think of cancer research we tended to think of cancerous then composed of three stages cancerous then composed of three stages cancerous then composed of three stages the first date is initiation that's when the first date is initiation that's when the first date is initiation that's when the cancer is forming from a mutation of the cancer is forming from a mutation of the cancer is forming from a mutation of mutated genes secondly we talk about a mutated genes secondly we talk about a mutated genes secondly we talk about a stage that takes a much longer period of stage that takes a much longer period of stage that takes a much longer period of time for promotion that's when the new time for promotion that's when the new time for promotion that's when the new cancer cells was formed then are divided cancer cells was formed then are divided cancer cells was formed then are divided and divided dividing and growing into and divided dividing and growing into and divided dividing and growing into tumors well and then the third stage is tumors well and then the third stage is tumors well and then the third stage is when the cancer is breaking away from when the cancer is breaking away from when the cancer is breaking away from this tissue of origin and going this tissue of origin and going this tissue of origin and going someplace else we call it metastasis and someplace else we call it metastasis and someplace else we call it metastasis and that is called progression so with that that is called progression so with that that is called progression so with that in mind in mind in mind I wanted to say you know what is the I wanted to say you know what is the I wanted to say you know what is the mechanism so we started out early in the mechanism so we started out early in the mechanism so we started out early in the simplest level looking for a mechanism simplest level looking for a mechanism simplest level looking for a mechanism in the first stage in the first stage in the first stage um and that and then we started finding um and that and then we started finding um and that and then we started finding Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism multiplied the entire doctoral multiplied the entire doctoral multiplied the entire doctoral dissertation of the student because dissertation of the student because dissertation of the student because there's a lot of work doing these kind there's a lot of work doing these kind there's a lot of work doing these kind of things of things of things in any case without a number of in any case without a number of in any case without a number of mechanisms that seem to be involved in mechanisms that seem to be involved in mechanisms that seem to be involved in initiation initiating the cancer initiation initiating the cancer initiation initiating the cancer the high protein diet could increase the the high protein diet could increase the the high protein diet could increase the rate of entry into of the car citizens rate of entry into of the car citizens rate of entry into of the car citizens into the cell oh that's pretty important into the cell oh that's pretty important into the cell oh that's pretty important when a course sentences get inside when a course sentences get inside when a course sentences get inside themselves they are metabolized by a themselves they are metabolized by a themselves they are metabolized by a mixed function oxidase enzyme system and mixed function oxidase enzyme system and mixed function oxidase enzyme system and methyl methyl methyl and what we found there was that and by and what we found there was that and by and what we found there was that and by the way it's metabolized to produce a the way it's metabolized to produce a the way it's metabolized to produce a product that's very reactive that then product that's very reactive that then product that's very reactive that then binds to the DNA of genes that's what binds to the DNA of genes that's what binds to the DNA of genes that's what indications occur what we found was that indications occur what we found was that indications occur what we found was that the high animal protein consumption the high animal protein consumption the high animal protein consumption increased the amount of enzyme being increased the amount of enzyme being increased the amount of enzyme being synthesized it increases rearrassed the synthesized it increases rearrassed the synthesized it increases rearrassed the structure so it became more accurate and structure so it became more accurate and structure so it became more accurate and then in turn it increased The Binding of then in turn it increased The Binding of then in turn it increased The Binding of the product that really reactive product the product that really reactive product the product that really reactive product of the imitation it increased the of the imitation it increased the of the imitation it increased the product to the DNA which was the product to the DNA which was the product to the DNA which was the beginning of limitation beginning of limitation beginning of limitation but then we have a incidentally a repair but then we have a incidentally a repair but then we have a incidentally a repair mechanism that keeps that under control mechanism that keeps that under control mechanism that keeps that under control if you will it's working all the time in if you will it's working all the time in if you will it's working all the time in our bodies it's called DNA repair what our bodies it's called DNA repair what our bodies it's called DNA repair what we found there was that high protein we found there was that high protein we found there was that high protein diet actually turned it off I mean the diet actually turned it off I mean the diet actually turned it off I mean the thing that's been protecting us the high thing that's been protecting us the high thing that's been protecting us the high protein does turn it off so there's a protein does turn it off so there's a protein does turn it off so there's a bunch of mechanisms in that first stage bunch of mechanisms in that first stage bunch of mechanisms in that first stage I'm getting a little bit frustrated I'm getting a little bit frustrated I'm getting a little bit frustrated maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're looking at here by this time looking at here by this time looking at here by this time so we turned her attention to the second so we turned her attention to the second so we turned her attention to the second stage now the second stage you'll notice stage now the second stage you'll notice stage now the second stage you'll notice I put arrows reversible arrows as a I put arrows reversible arrows as a I put arrows reversible arrows as a result of the research that we were result of the research that we were result of the research that we were doing turning cancer involved doing turning cancer involved doing turning cancer involved um and so in the second stage we started um and so in the second stage we started um and so in the second stage we started looking for mechanisms again we found a looking for mechanisms again we found a looking for mechanisms again we found a bunch of mechanisms uh one here in bunch of mechanisms uh one here in bunch of mechanisms uh one here in yellow that was a good one that's called yellow that was a good one that's called yellow that was a good one that's called natural killer cell activity no these natural killer cell activity no these natural killer cell activity no these are done by the way it's about 25 30 are done by the way it's about 25 30 are done by the way it's about 25 30 years ago natural killer cells now are years ago natural killer cells now are years ago natural killer cells now are the topic of discussion these days for the topic of discussion these days for the topic of discussion these days for trying to figure out a drug that enhance trying to figure out a drug that enhance trying to figure out a drug that enhance their activity but in any case their activity but in any case their activity but in any case we found that the high protein diet we found that the high protein diet we found that the high protein diet decreased decreased decreased natural killer cells the good stuff and natural killer cells the good stuff and natural killer cells the good stuff and increase the rate at which cells divide increase the rate at which cells divide increase the rate at which cells divide it increased the ability of the of the it increased the ability of the of the it increased the ability of the of the uh the protein increased the ability to uh the protein increased the ability to uh the protein increased the ability to approaching the form very reactive approaching the form very reactive approaching the form very reactive compounds called ocean radicals compounds called ocean radicals compounds called ocean radicals caution caution caution pre-reactive oxygen species something I pre-reactive oxygen species something I pre-reactive oxygen species something I can say it also did some of the can say it also did some of the can say it also did some of the increased the production of hormone and increased the production of hormone and increased the production of hormone and altered calories so we here we had all altered calories so we here we had all altered calories so we here we had all these mechanisms just kept popping up these mechanisms just kept popping up these mechanisms just kept popping up every time that and I said this was every time that and I said this was every time that and I said this was going over a period at least 10 12 even going over a period at least 10 12 even going over a period at least 10 12 even even longer I guess for doing this kind even longer I guess for doing this kind even longer I guess for doing this kind of research so in a summary we found of research so in a summary we found of research so in a summary we found that eight of these mechanisms uh that eight of these mechanisms uh that eight of these mechanisms uh increased cancer uh and two of them that increased cancer uh and two of them that increased cancer uh and two of them that were good and they were turned off so we were good and they were turned off so we were good and they were turned off so we got 10 mechanisms wow got 10 mechanisms wow got 10 mechanisms wow all 10 worked in the unison all 10 worked in the unison all 10 worked in the unison to increase cancer that was the thought to increase cancer that was the thought to increase cancer that was the thought that I found really quite remarkable that I found really quite remarkable that I found really quite remarkable it's not about one mechanism all of a it's not about one mechanism all of a it's not about one mechanism all of a sudden I started losing my interest in sudden I started losing my interest in sudden I started losing my interest in the idea that there was one mechanism the idea that there was one mechanism the idea that there was one mechanism that might lend itself to let's say that might lend itself to let's say that might lend itself to let's say pharmacologic treatment pharmacologic treatment pharmacologic treatment instead there's nutrition was just instead there's nutrition was just instead there's nutrition was just everything was just going wrong at the everything was just going wrong at the everything was just going wrong at the same time we we've worked on 10 I could same time we we've worked on 10 I could same time we we've worked on 10 I could probably put up another couple here that probably put up another couple here that probably put up another couple here that we had information on I'm sure now is we had information on I'm sure now is we had information on I'm sure now is far more than that far more than that far more than that but the point is the high protein diet but the point is the high protein diet but the point is the high protein diet just changed all these mechanisms almost just changed all these mechanisms almost just changed all these mechanisms almost simultaneously to do the same thing simultaneously to do the same thing simultaneously to do the same thing in unison in unison in unison so as far as drug intervention is so as far as drug intervention is so as far as drug intervention is concerned forget it that's not the way concerned forget it that's not the way concerned forget it that's not the way to solve the problem to solve the problem to solve the problem it'll bring to your attention the use of it'll bring to your attention the use of it'll bring to your attention the use of statins for example that's been invented statins for example that's been invented statins for example that's been invented created billions of dollars of profit created billions of dollars of profit created billions of dollars of profit that are being used supposedly to that are being used supposedly to that are being used supposedly to control heart disease control heart disease control heart disease doesn't work that way not like that does doesn't work that way not like that does doesn't work that way not like that does so which mechanism which drug that was a so which mechanism

story in this just tell you one more story in this just tell you one more story in this first presentation that kind of fit in first presentation that kind of fit in first presentation that kind of fit in pretty well with what I was learning pretty well with what I was learning pretty well with what I was learning about all these mechanisms of working about all these mechanisms of working about all these mechanisms of working together as animal protein that was together as animal protein that was together as animal protein that was doing it not plant protein doing it not plant protein doing it not plant protein recently I had a chance to go back into recently I had a chance to go back into recently I had a chance to go back into the literature and look at let's say the literature and look at let's say the literature and look at let's say some researchers that may have compared some researchers that may have compared some researchers that may have compared animal protein intake against some animal protein intake against some animal protein intake against some disease disease disease and found quite a few cure or something and found quite a few cure or something and found quite a few cure or something here's a plot of a researcher some years here's a plot of a researcher some years here's a plot of a researcher some years ago ago ago who found that increasing among you know who found that increasing among you know who found that increasing among you know these are different countries okay these are different countries okay these are different countries okay United States is right there you can see United States is right there you can see United States is right there you can see among different countries you can see as among different countries you can see as among different countries you can see as daily animal protein consumption goes up daily animal protein consumption goes up daily animal protein consumption goes up renal cancer goes up real cancer renal cancer goes up real cancer renal cancer goes up real cancer incidence that's kidney cancer incidence that's kidney cancer incidence that's kidney cancer uh I drew that line there myself uh I drew that line there myself uh I drew that line there myself um and it turns out that it was a um and it turns out that it was a um and it turns out that it was a according to an algorithm according to an algorithm according to an algorithm characteristics or conditions if you characteristics or conditions if you characteristics or conditions if you will will will um in any case what we see here is is um in any case what we see here is is um in any case what we see here is is almost a straight-line relationship almost a straight-line relationship almost a straight-line relationship really impressive really impressive really impressive in other words decrease in animal in other words decrease in animal in other words decrease in animal protection consumption brings to kidney protection consumption brings to kidney protection consumption brings to kidney cancer risk down to just above zero cancer risk down to just above zero cancer risk down to just above zero here's another one here's a paper here's another one here's a paper here's another one here's a paper published in 1959 by a member of a published in 1959 by a member of a published in 1959 by a member of a jolliff an older man at the time when I jolliff an older man at the time when I jolliff an older man at the time when I was a registered I I actually met him was a registered I I actually met him was a registered I I actually met him and he what he showed was that and he what he showed was that and he what he showed was that increasing protein consumption for increasing protein consumption for increasing protein consumption for different countries so just by numbers different countries so just by numbers different countries so just by numbers here increasing protein increased here increasing protein increased here increasing protein increased heart disease deaths again I draw the heart disease deaths again I draw the heart disease deaths again I draw the line through there and what I get is line through there and what I get is line through there and what I get is this just like that this just like that this just like that here's another one it's more recent here's another one it's more recent here's another one it's more recent times here's a relationship between times here's a relationship between times here's a relationship between non-fat milk consumption and prostate non-fat milk consumption and prostate non-fat milk consumption and prostate cancer wow that line just come right cancer wow that line just come right cancer wow that line just come right down closer to the zero there you have down closer to the zero there you have down closer to the zero there you have it right there and so it looks like not it right there and so it looks like not it right there and so it looks like not that milk skim milk if you will is that milk skim milk if you will is that milk skim milk if you will is better than whole milk that's what that better than whole milk that's what that better than whole milk that's what that suggests suggests suggests we did that on the farm by the way uh we did that on the farm by the way uh we did that on the farm by the way uh when it first came out about fat we were when it first came out about fat we were when it first came out about fat we were basically Central Fusion or melting basically Central Fusion or melting basically Central Fusion or melting making skim milk but that's set that making skim milk but that's set that making skim milk but that's set that aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat skim milk the good stuff a lot of people skim milk the good stuff a lot of people skim milk the good stuff a lot of people thought It's associated with prostate thought It's associated with prostate thought It's associated with prostate cancer wow cancer wow cancer wow here's one my good friend from the here's one my good friend from the here's one my good friend from the University of Western Ontario in Canada University of Western Ontario in Canada University of Western Ontario in Canada Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of countries and he was looking at the risk countries and he was looking at the risk countries and he was looking at the risk to the dietary infection on the breast to the dietary infection on the breast to the dietary infection on the breast cancer or mortality for a different cancer or mortality for a different cancer or mortality for a different watches of countries watches of countries watches of countries and he concluded that as total fat and he concluded that as total fat and he concluded that as total fat increases I've come to that ammonia the increases I've come to that ammonia the increases I've come to that ammonia the the risk of drug breast cancer went up the risk of drug breast cancer went up the risk of drug breast cancer went up but more particularly it was a saturated but more particularly it was a saturated but more particularly it was a saturated fat common in animal Foods that's where fat common in animal Foods that's where fat common in animal Foods that's where the line really occurred very impressive the line really occurred very impressive the line really occurred very impressive once again the lines from weight down once again the lines from weight down once again the lines from weight down through almost there if you will through almost there if you will through almost there if you will there's another one there's another one there's another one this is reversing the axis the the this is reversing the axis the the this is reversing the axis the the cholesterol the dietary things on the cholesterol the dietary things on the cholesterol the dietary things on the y-axis in this case but what it shows is y-axis in this case but what it shows is y-axis in this case but what it shows is that again heart disease risk is that again heart disease risk is that again heart disease risk is increased for these different countries increased for these different countries increased for these different countries there's the U.S way up here any priest there's the U.S way up here any priest there's the U.S way up here any priest with all these countries has cholesterol with all these countries has cholesterol with all these countries has cholesterol intake goes up now cholesterol comes intake goes up now cholesterol comes intake goes up now cholesterol comes from animal food only right from animal food only right from animal food only right so we've got now cholesterol calcium so we've got now cholesterol calcium so we've got now cholesterol calcium heart disease it looks like heart disease it looks like heart disease it looks like um here's one for meat consumption and um here's one for meat consumption and um here's one for meat consumption and colon cancer still another research colon cancer still another research colon cancer still another research group group group here's one for uterine cancer and total here's one for uterine cancer and total here's one for uterine cancer and total fat it's like total fat then it tend to fat it's like total fat then it tend to fat it's like total fat then it tend to reflects uh animal food consumption by reflects uh animal food consumption by reflects uh animal food consumption by the way for different countries the way for different countries the way for different countries and finally and finally and finally this impression appearance namely all this impression appearance namely all this impression appearance namely all these different things whether it's meat these different things whether it's meat these different things whether it's meat intake or whether it's total fat intake intake or whether it's total fat intake intake or whether it's total fat intake or stem milk or cholesterol whatever or stem milk or cholesterol whatever or stem milk or cholesterol whatever these are animal protein circuits now these are animal protein circuits now these are animal protein circuits now that's a really important part to make that's a really important part to make that's a really important part to make because the researchers who focus on because the researchers who focus on because the researchers who focus on each one of these individual things that each one of these individual things that each one of these individual things that in turn tended to generate a lot of in turn tended to generate a lot of in turn tended to generate a lot of interest in that one thing interest in that one thing interest in that one thing and a lot of researchers done you know and a lot of researchers done you know and a lot of researchers done you know something's wrong with let's say something's wrong with let's say something's wrong with let's say saturated fat something's wrong with saturated fat something's wrong with saturated fat something's wrong with some names what's kind of meat you know some names what's kind of meat you know some names what's kind of meat you know or I mean that focus on one thing at a or I mean that focus on one thing at a or I mean that focus on one thing at a time just just export it into time just just export it into time just just export it into further questions as to what's special further questions as to what's special further questions as to what's special about that particular kind of flu or about that particular kind of flu or about that particular kind of flu or Newton Newton Newton so I call them animal protein surgery so I call them animal protein surgery so I call them animal protein surgery it's all shown the same thing it's all shown the same thing it's all shown the same thing so what's common to them what's Karma so what's common to them what's Karma so what's common to them what's Karma job is the protein job is the protein job is the protein is animal protein so on that question by is animal protein so on that question by is animal protein so on that question by the way uh my friend tantaro was he was the way uh my friend tantaro was he was the way uh my friend tantaro was he was looking at the saturated fat versus looking at the saturated fat versus looking at the saturated fat versus breast cancer thing he also had breast cancer thing he also had breast cancer thing he also had information on the conceptual plant information on the conceptual plant information on the conceptual plant protein he didn't call it plant protein protein he didn't call it plant protein protein he didn't call it plant protein to call it unsaturated fat to call it unsaturated fat to call it unsaturated fat but there's no relationship no but there's no relationship no but there's no relationship no relationship so this team this these relationship so this team this these relationship so this team this these linear regressions seem to be uh linear regressions seem to be uh linear regressions seem to be uh basically four animal food not plant for basically four animal food not plant for basically four animal food not plant for animal protein in particular animal protein in particular animal protein in particular so let me leave that with you for the so let me leave that with you for the so let me leave that with you for the moment moment moment um and uh just remind us that what what um and uh just remind us that what what um and uh just remind us that what what an attempted

wanted to and those big problems I wanted to suggest really come back to suggest really come back to suggest really come back to and we'll talk about this in the next and we'll talk about this in the next and we'll talk about this in the next presentation come back to the food we presentation come back to the food we presentation come back to the food we eat eat eat and the food we eat it causes the and the food we eat it causes the and the food we eat it causes the problems is characterized by the problems is characterized by the problems is characterized by the fascination that we have for animal fascination that we have for animal fascination that we have for animal protein thank you okay back again uh for the second half okay back again uh for the second half of this commentary uh and before getting of this commentary uh and before getting of this commentary uh and before getting into the comments here uh let me just into the comments here uh let me just into the comments here uh let me just briefly just highlight a couple of briefly just highlight a couple of briefly just highlight a couple of points I was tempted to make in the points I was tempted to make in the points I was tempted to make in the first part a few a few points that we first part a few a few points that we first part a few a few points that we might consider so far might consider so far might consider so far um first um first um first um as I mentioned I'm really addressing um as I mentioned I'm really addressing um as I mentioned I'm really addressing a an issue having to do with multiple a an issue having to do with multiple a an issue having to do with multiple problems having to do with human health problems having to do with human health problems having to do with human health or human and planetary health and or human and planetary health and or human and planetary health and suggesting in fact to working toward the suggesting in fact to working toward the suggesting in fact to working toward the idea that there's one main cause the idea that there's one main cause the idea that there's one main cause the possible one main solution to solving is possible one main solution to solving is possible one main solution to solving is very complicated set of problems very complicated set of problems very complicated set of problems and I'm suggesting too as she already and I'm suggesting too as she already and I'm suggesting too as she already heard from the first commentary I'm heard from the first commentary I'm heard from the first commentary I'm suggesting that it's our fascination suggesting that it's our fascination suggesting that it's our fascination or long-time fascination with high or long-time fascination with high or long-time fascination with high quality animal protein quality animal protein quality animal protein you know a lot of people think protein you know a lot of people think protein you know a lot of people think protein is just in animals it's not quite but at is just in animals it's not quite but at is just in animals it's not quite but at least it's high quality fascination with least it's high quality fascination with least it's high quality fascination with high quality animal protein and I'm high quality animal protein and I'm high quality animal protein and I'm going to say that this is the main going to say that this is the main going to say that this is the main driver driver driver of food production of food production of food production and food shorts and food shorts and food shorts for well over a century for well over a century for well over a century and I want to talk about that the and I want to talk about that the and I want to talk about that the consequences of that Fascination example consequences of that Fascination example consequences of that Fascination example of protein if the world of protein if the world of protein if the world I want to talk a little bit about the I want to talk a little bit about the I want to talk a little bit about the origin the consequences of this origin the consequences of this origin the consequences of this fascination fascination fascination On the Origin I want to go back to On the Origin I want to go back to On the Origin I want to go back to Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who discovered protein well he was he had uh discovered protein well he was he had uh discovered protein well he was he had uh he was doing a dog experiment actually he was doing a dog experiment actually he was doing a dog experiment actually and the dog was eating meat and he and the dog was eating meat and he and the dog was eating meat and he realized that the dog had to have some realized that the dog had to have some realized that the dog had to have some meat or would die or suffer problems and meat or would die or suffer problems and meat or would die or suffer problems and so he said he's a chemist he set out to so he said he's a chemist he set out to so he said he's a chemist he set out to try to find in there or something in try to find in there or something in try to find in there or something in there they might be able to isolate he there they might be able to isolate he there they might be able to isolate he found a compound a material had to give found a compound a material had to give found a compound a material had to give it a name it a name it a name he gave it a name after the Greek word he gave it a name after the Greek word he gave it a name after the Greek word proteos proteos proteos which means our Prime importance so in a which means our Prime importance so in a which means our Prime importance so in a sense the word

that in turn relates to a concept we and that in turn relates to a concept we call biological value that actually is call biological value that actually is call biological value that actually is what I really redid on myself in my what I really redid on myself in my what I really redid on myself in my inductive dissertation in years ago this inductive dissertation in years ago this inductive dissertation in years ago this whole concept of you know trying to find whole concept of you know trying to find whole concept of you know trying to find a protein that has the highest a protein that has the highest a protein that has the highest biological value or equality biological value or equality biological value or equality animal proteins by the way and I can't animal proteins by the way and I can't animal proteins by the way and I can't get into all the details here but it's get into all the details here but it's get into all the details here but it's convincingly I'll show you this animal convincingly I'll show you this animal convincingly I'll show you this animal proteins retain more of the protein they proteins retain more of the protein they proteins retain more of the protein they consume okay that's referred to as high consume okay that's referred to as high consume okay that's referred to as high quality plant proteins no reason as much quality plant proteins no reason as much quality plant proteins no reason as much they're low quality so animal proteins they're low quality so animal proteins they're low quality so animal proteins are high quality plant proteins are for are high quality plant proteins are for are high quality plant proteins are for low carbons everybody was quality right low carbons everybody was quality right low carbons everybody was quality right well that kind of equipment or well that kind of equipment or well that kind of equipment or Consciousness and uh so if you really Consciousness and uh so if you really Consciousness and uh so if you really want to get real protein eat animal want to get real protein eat animal want to get real protein eat animal protein uh if you don't want to do that protein uh if you don't want to do that protein uh if you don't want to do that then create the plant proteins in such a then create the plant proteins in such a then create the plant proteins in such a way that you get high quality okay way that you get high quality okay way that you get high quality okay that's been with us forever that's been with us forever that's been with us forever so this origin of the concept of high so this origin of the concept of high so this origin of the concept of high quality uh actually arose formally from quality uh actually arose formally from quality uh actually arose formally from a professor at the University of a professor at the University of a professor at the University of Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 and uh he is titled a message for and uh he is titled a message for and uh he is titled a message for determine the biological value of determine the biological value of determine the biological value of protein high quality well protein high quality well protein high quality well so it means more protein being retained so it means more protein being retained so it means more protein being retained well for what purpose well well for what purpose well well for what purpose well it actually related more protein is it actually related more protein is it actually related more protein is being retained by a given amount of being retained by a given amount of being retained by a given amount of protein The Bachelor rate of body weight protein The Bachelor rate of body weight

speeding up growths obviously you know speeding up growths obviously you know speeding up growths obviously means more profit for the means more profit for the means more profit for the livestock-based agriculture good deal so livestock-based agriculture good deal so livestock-based agriculture good deal so you want to stick to protein as high you want to stick to protein as high you want to stick to protein as high quality whoops but there's a problem with that whoops but there's a problem with that thought it's been around for ever it's thought it's been around for ever it's thought it's been around for ever it's in our Consciousness we don't think in our Consciousness we don't think in our Consciousness we don't think about it the public never thinks about about it the public never thinks about about it the public never thinks about it quite frankly that way but they just it quite frankly that way but they just it quite frankly that way but they just know whose protein know whose protein know whose protein it turns out in a more recent times and it turns out in a more recent times and it turns out in a more recent times and not so just reasons there's a couple of not so just reasons there's a couple of not so just reasons there's a couple of cases here quite a long time ago it cases here quite a long time ago it cases here quite a long time ago it turns out that the more protein being turns out that the more protein being turns out that the more protein being retained also does some other things retained also does some other things retained also does some other things look look look the higher the retention it increases the higher the retention it increases the higher the retention it increases growth hormone growth hormone growth hormone we showed that no rats it increases we showed that no rats it increases we showed that no rats it increases blood cholesterol blood estrogen levels blood cholesterol blood estrogen levels blood cholesterol blood estrogen levels that's a female hormone circulating that's a female hormone circulating that's a female hormone circulating hormone that relation turned to breast hormone that relation turned to breast hormone that relation turned to breast cancer earlier Asian men are more more cancer earlier Asian men are more more cancer earlier Asian men are more more urine tests and so forth so higher urine tests and so forth so higher urine tests and so forth so higher protein than retained means more growth protein than retained means more growth protein than retained means more growth hormone hormone hormone more estrogen it also turns on the more estrogen it also turns on the more estrogen it also turns on the production of so-called free radicals production of so-called free radicals production of so-called free radicals those are dangerous little things they those are dangerous little things they those are dangerous little things they can be useful they said your body the can be useful they said your body the can be useful they said your body the body has a way of using those things but body has a way of using those things but body has a way of using those things but when we increase the production free when we increase the production free when we increase the production free radicals filter Skelter they actually radicals filter Skelter they actually

1940s the minimum amount of protein we 1940s the minimum amount of protein we 1940s the minimum amount of protein we need is about five to six percent of need is about five to six percent of need is about five to six percent of tenants that's all tenants that's all tenants that's all but that uh experimental result uh was but that uh experimental result uh was but that uh experimental result uh was then increased by a couple of standard then increased by a couple of standard then increased by a couple of standard deviations to make sure everybody in the deviations to make sure everybody in

right time it's the right time we do not there's no basis no basis for consuming there's no basis no basis for consuming there's no basis no basis for consuming animal food in order to get that animal food in order to get that animal food in order to get that so-called high quality protein that's so-called high quality protein that's so-called high quality protein that's nonsense nonsense nonsense uh and by the way hopefully plant-baside uh and by the way hopefully plant-baside uh and by the way hopefully plant-baside stage yes stage yes stage yes they they're as low as eight by ten they they're as low as eight by ten they they're as low as eight by ten percent protein maybe in some cases if percent protein maybe in some cases if percent protein maybe in some cases if you just eat potatoes so for example you just eat potatoes so for example you just eat potatoes so for example but in reality these are plant-based but in reality these are plant-based but in reality these are plant-based diets can go up to 15 even close 20 diets can go up to 15 even close 20 diets can go up to 15 even close 20 percent get a lot of views and things percent get a lot of views and things percent get a lot of views and things like that no problem like that no problem like that no problem because now you consuming Whole Food the because now you consuming Whole Food the because now you consuming Whole Food the protein is going to perform it don't do protein is going to perform it don't do protein is going to perform it don't do the same thing you're going to do all the same thing you're going to do all the same thing you're going to do all these things working too and that's just these things working too and that's just these things working too and that's just subject for another time but in any case subject for another time but in any case subject for another time but in any case Whole Food plant-based protein is enough Whole Food plant-based protein is enough Whole Food plant-based protein is enough and so what happened and so what happened and so what happened in 2002. by the way dietary guidelines in 2002. by the way dietary guidelines in 2002. by the way dietary guidelines uh in the United States are updated uh in the United States are updated uh in the United States are updated every five years with the committee every five years with the committee every five years with the committee uh usually it's the amount of protein uh usually it's the amount of protein uh usually it's the amount of protein needed in other nutrients needed are needed in other nutrients needed are needed in other nutrients needed are framed by the national academic science framed by the national academic science framed by the national academic science and then that's passed off to the doctor and then that's passed off to the doctor and then that's passed off to the doctor to the usaid doctor guidelines and so to the usaid doctor guidelines and so to the usaid doctor guidelines and so this what I'm showing you here right now this what I'm showing you here right now this what I'm showing you here right now in in 2002 a decision was made by the in in 2002 a decision was made by the in in 2002 a decision was made by the committee that determines how much committee that determines how much committee that determines how much nutrients you should have they want to nutrients you should have they want to nutrients you should have they want to sit an upper limit for nutrient intake sit an upper limit for nutrient intake sit an upper limit for nutrient intake upper safe limit for protein they said upper safe limit for protein they said upper safe limit for protein they said that's 35 percent that's 35 percent that's 35 percent we can't even get up to that here's we can't even get up to that here's we can't even get up to that here's where I see that line right there we where I see that line right there we where I see that line right there we can't even get it to 35 quite frankly can't even get it to 35 quite frankly can't even get it to 35 quite frankly it's very very difficult it's very very difficult it's very very difficult what this this was an invitation to what this this was an invitation to what this this was an invitation to consume as much high quality protein consume as much high quality protein consume as much high quality protein animal-based as you can stuff in animal-based as you can stuff in animal-based as you can stuff in yourself yourself yourself really that that this was an insane really that that this was an insane really that that this was an insane recommendation but it made it into the recommendation but it made it into the recommendation but it made it into the Press Press Press it was adopted you know for school lunch it was adopted you know for school lunch it was adopted you know for school lunch programs and everything else you don't programs and everything else you don't programs and everything else you don't eat as much protein it's all good for eat as much protein it's all good for eat as much protein it's all good for you and so you and so you and so I call that the the activity of the mob I call that the the activity of the mob I call that the the activity of the mob power I know there's a couple of power I know there's a couple of power I know there's a couple of

they were the ones consuming animal food they were the ones consuming animal food they were the ones with the active virus they got infected with the active virus they got infected with the active virus they got infected the virus the virus called the cancer the virus the virus called the cancer the virus the virus called the cancer highly correlated with those two highly correlated with those two highly correlated with those two also at the same time we learned from also at the same time we learned from also at the same time we learned from laboratory studies that the people laboratory studies that the people laboratory studies that the people consuming a little more animal food consuming a little more animal food consuming a little more animal food uh they likely saw a decrease in their uh they likely saw a decrease in their uh they likely saw a decrease in their natural killer cells and I say likely natural killer cells and I say likely natural killer cells and I say likely because we we did a study in some because we we did a study in some because we we did a study in some companion experimental animal studies in companion experimental animal studies in companion experimental animal studies in the lab painting animals that actually the lab painting animals that actually the lab painting animals that actually right in this case mice did give rise to right in

x-ray here to remind myself remind myself remind myself do you know when that when uh the the do you know when that when uh the the do you know when that when uh the the the the the coronavirus first was being told to the coronavirus first was being told to the coronavirus first was being told to the Americans objectives as I say around Americans objectives as I say around Americans objectives as I say around January February so of 2020 two years January February so of 2020 two years January February so of 2020 two years ago ago ago but when I was first being told but when I was first being told but when I was first being told all they kept talking about was the all they kept talking about was the all they kept talking about was the number of cases as if they mean death number of cases as if they mean death number of cases as if they mean death they don't by the way but they call it they don't by the way but they call it they don't by the way but they call it it was almost like

And sure enough, some of get exposed to. And sure enough, some of get exposed to. And sure enough, some of them can in fact sort of initiate them can in fact sort of initiate them can in fact sort of initiate cancer. That's not the issue. But in any cancer. That's not the issue. But in any cancer. That's not the issue. But in any case, that's one way that we tend to case, that's one way that we tend to case, that's one way that we tend to think about the causes of cancer. The think about the causes of cancer. The think about the causes of cancer. The other way to some extent we know of other way to some extent we know of other way to some extent we know of certain viruses that might lead to certain viruses that might lead to certain viruses that might lead to cancer. Things like hepatitis B virus or cancer. Things like hepatitis B virus or cancer. Things like hepatitis B virus or papilloma virus. Maybe you've heard papilloma virus. Maybe you've heard papilloma virus. Maybe you've heard about these causing particular kinds of about these causing particular kinds of about these causing particular kinds of cancers. So those are a couple of kinds cancers. So those are a couple of kinds cancers. So those are a couple of kinds of causes of of causes of of causes of cancer. Thirdly, we tend to think that cancer. Thirdly, we tend to think that cancer. Thirdly, we tend to think that genes cause genes cause genes cause cancer. What that really means in a cancer. What that really means in a cancer. What that really means in a practical sense is that cancer runs in practical sense is that cancer runs in practical sense is that cancer runs in certain families and we have a genetic certain families and we have a genetic certain families and we have a genetic predisposition some of us if you will predisposition some of us if you will predisposition some of us if you will for getting cancer. Those are the three for getting cancer. Those are the three for getting cancer. Those are the three big ticket kind of ideas that most big ticket kind of ideas that most big ticket kind of ideas that most people talked about in science and to people talked about in science and to people talked about in science and to some extent in the public about what some extent in the public about what some extent in the public about what causes cancer. What we were seeing here causes cancer. What we were seeing here causes cancer. What we were seeing here and this I want to go through this and this I want to go through this and this I want to go through this because what we were seeing here was because what we were seeing here was because what we were seeing here was really substantially really substantially really substantially different. What I was seeing I thought different. What I was seeing I thought different. What I was seeing I thought was the idea that simply nutrition the was the idea that simply nutrition the was the idea that simply nutrition the stuff that we regard as important to our stuff that we regard as important to our stuff that we regard as important to our health when done in the wrong way that health when done in the wrong way that health when done in the wrong way that could cause cancer. So that was an could cause cancer. So that was an could cause cancer. So that was an exciting proposition. So you have a exciting proposition. So you have a exciting proposition. So you have a first principle nutrition could turn on first principle nutrition could turn on first principle nutrition could turn on and turn off cancer. You might wonder and turn off cancer. You might wonder and turn off cancer. You might wonder where I'm going with this. where I'm going with this. where I'm going with this. But at the end of the presentation, I But at the end of the presentation, I But at the end of the presentation, I want to I'm going to end up with about want to I'm going to end up with about want to I'm going to end up with about eight principles and it's going to sort eight principles and it's going to sort eight principles and it's going to sort of like be the pillar post of how we of like be the pillar post of how we of like be the pillar post of how we tend to think about science and how that tend to think about science and how that tend to think about science and how that in turn tends to think and shape our way in turn tends to think and shape our way in turn tends to think and shape our way of thinking about nutrition and health. of thinking about nutrition and health. of thinking about nutrition and health. In any case, here's the second one. Uh In any case, here's the second one. Uh In any case, here's the second one. Uh this is a little schematic. This is this is a little schematic. This is this is a little schematic. This is schematic uh simply to illustrate let's schematic uh simply to illustrate let's schematic uh simply to illustrate let's say in this particular case how genes say in this particular case how genes say in this particular case how genes become involved in causing cancer become involved in causing cancer become involved in causing cancer information. what I'm showing here and information. what I'm showing here and information. what I'm showing here and this is just a schematic in this this is just a schematic in this this is just a schematic in this particular case here we've got some particular case here we've got some particular case here we've got some normal cells let's normal cells let's normal cells let's say on one hand if we let's say mutate say on one hand if we let's say mutate say on one hand if we let's say mutate some of these cells to create more some of these cells to create more some of these cells to create more cancer cancer cancer genes as you can see here with a red genes as you can see here with a red genes as you can see here with a red sort of little cells over here we'll sort of little cells over here we'll sort of little cells over here we'll take we'll do for comparison another take we'll do for comparison another take we'll do for comparison another sort of experiment where we create less sort of experiment where we create less sort of experiment where we create less cancer genes so we get two sort of cancer genes so we get two sort of cancer genes so we get two sort of situations here one situation with a lot situations here one situation with a lot situations here one situation with a lot of cancer genes the other with much of cancer genes the other with much of cancer genes the other with much less. Now from that point onwards in less. Now from that point onwards in less. Now from that point onwards in theory and to some extent in practice if theory and to some extent in practice if theory and to some extent in practice if the nutrition stays the the nutrition stays the the nutrition stays the same obviously the animals starting out same obviously the animals starting out same obviously the animals starting out or the or the or the people if if those of us who have more people if if those of us who have more people if if those of us who have more cancer genes and we do the same kind cancer genes and we do the same kind cancer genes and we do the same kind let's say in theory do the same kind of let's say in theory do the same kind of let's say in theory do the same kind of nutrition we get more tumors that is nutrition we get more tumors that is nutrition we get more tumors that is fair enough to say that genes cause fair enough to say that genes cause fair enough to say that genes cause cancer more cancer over here less over cancer more cancer over here less over cancer more cancer over here less over here so genes cause cancer here so genes cause cancer here so genes cause cancer That's a popular idea. We think genes That's a popular idea. We think genes That's a popular idea. We think genes cause cancer. I must tell you everything cause cancer. I must tell you everything cause cancer. I must tell you everything actually whether it's cancer or other actually whether it's cancer or other actually whether it's cancer or other diseases or good things, good health. diseases or good things, good health. diseases or good things, good health. Everything starts from a genetic basis. Everything starts from a genetic basis. Everything starts from a genetic basis. That's the first step. So we get all That's the first step. So we get all That's the first step. So we get all kinds of genes to do all kinds of kinds of genes to do all kinds of kinds of genes to do all kinds of things, good things, bad things if you things, good things, bad things if you things, good things, bad things if you will. So genes are the starting place will. So genes are the starting place will. So genes are the starting place and it's reasonable to assume therefore and it's reasonable to assume therefore and it's reasonable to assume therefore they are a cause. However, look at this. they are a cause. However, look at this. they are a cause. However, look at this. when in this particular kind of scheme when in this particular kind of scheme when in this particular kind of scheme and this is what we basically did. Uh in and this is what we basically did. Uh in and this is what we basically did. Uh in any case here in this particular case any case here in this particular case any case here in this particular case here these animals are destined to get here these animals are destined to get here these animals are destined to get more tumors these over here less but in more tumors these over here less but in more tumors these over here less but in fact if these in this particular case fact if these in this particular case fact if these in this particular case here are given low protein they get the here are given low protein they get the here are given low protein they get the less. So in other words whereas we may less. So in other words whereas we may less. So in other words whereas we may have assumed that genes are so important have assumed that genes are so important have assumed that genes are so important and how much you know altered genes we and how much you know altered genes we and how much you know altered genes we may have in the beginning what really may have in the beginning what really may have in the beginning what really matters is what we subsequently do with matters is what we subsequently do with matters is what we subsequently do with those genes. And so nutrition controls those genes. And so nutrition controls those genes. And so nutrition controls how genes behave. Very important how genes behave. Very important how genes behave. Very important principle. A very important principle principle. A very important principle principle. A very important principle has major implications for thinking has major implications for thinking has major implications for thinking about all kinds of things. So principle about all kinds of things. So principle about all kinds of things. So principle number two, nutrition cults genes which number two, nutrition cults genes which number two, nutrition cults genes which in turn control cancer. In cancer. In addition, then we I began to ask the addition, then we I began to ask the addition, then we I began to ask the question, I didn't pay a lot of question, I didn't pay a lot of question, I didn't pay a lot of attention to this in the beginning to attention to this in the beginning to attention to this in the beginning to start to ask the question, what about start to ask the question, what about start to ask the question, what about this protein that actually is this protein that actually is this protein that actually is controlling cancer growth? What is this controlling cancer growth? What is this controlling cancer growth? What is this protein we're using? Well, it turns out protein we're using? Well, it turns out protein we're using? Well, it turns out we were just simply using the protein we were just simply using the protein we were just simply using the protein that was available in the marketplace at that was available in the marketplace at that was available in the marketplace at the time that researchers tend to use, the time that researchers tend to use, the time that researchers tend to use, one readily available. It actually turns one readily available. It actually turns one readily available. It actually turns out to be cow's milk protein. out to be cow's milk protein. out to be cow's milk protein. So um that's basically casein So um that's basically casein So um that's basically casein representing 87% approximately of total representing 87% approximately of total representing 87% approximately of total protein in cow's milk. That's what was protein in cow's milk. That's what was protein in cow's milk. That's what was turning on in fact the cancer. So we turning on in fact the cancer. So we turning on in fact the cancer. So we said okay what happens if we try a said okay what happens if we try a said okay what happens if we try a couple of plant proteins in this model. couple of plant proteins in this model. couple of plant proteins in this model. It turned out when we tried soy protein It turned out when we tried soy protein It turned out when we tried soy protein and wheat protein even when fed at the and wheat protein even when fed at the and wheat protein even when fed at the high levels the 20% of total high levels the 20% of total high levels the 20% of total incidentally that 20% of protein in the incidentally that 20% of protein in the incidentally that 20% of protein in the diet was the amount more or less diet was the amount more or less diet was the amount more or less recommended.

But too but for for just for the moment. But too but for for just for the moment. But in any case soy protein we protein even in any case soy protein we protein even in any case soy protein we protein even when fed at the higher levels did not in when fed at the higher levels did not in when fed at the higher levels did not in fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was all of a sudden an idea that was all of a sudden an idea that was all of a sudden an idea that was beginning to arise. Not enough beginning to arise. Not enough beginning to arise.

        "content": "•••   DAIRY MYTH   •••\nA long-standing, prevalent belief champions dairy as the perfect food. While it may indeed be ideal for calves it is not the case for humans. The perfect food for humans is human milk, and that too only during infancy. Humans are unique in two respects: (1) they continue milk consumption beyond infancy and (2) they consume the milk of another species. The origins of this practice are murky but it may have begun thousands of years ago during a famine. In desperate times consumption of cow’s milk, which led to survival, may have sparked the widespread domestication of cows.\nThis topic presents a personal conflict for me. Numerous doctors in the Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement advise against dairy, supported by a plethora of studies. However Ayurveda, an ancient Indian wisdom, endorses it, albeit sparingly. Most PBWF recommendations align with Ayurveda except for dairy products like milk and ghee.\nAll mammals nurse their young with milk specifically formulated for their offspring's growth rate. For instance, a calf grows tenfold in six months, necessitating a milk composition rich in proteins, fats, and growth hormones like IGF-1. These components, while beneficial for calves, can potentially fuel cancer cell growth in humans without affecting normal cells, akin to how fertilizers promote lawn growth but also enable weeds to flourish unchecked.\nINDIAN STUDY ON DAIRY PROTEIN\nA groundbreaking study in 1967 by Dr. Gopalan and Madhvan at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad (India) examined the effects of dietary protein levels on cancer development. Mice, injected with a carcinogen and fed diets of varying protein levels, showed a direct correlation between high dairy protein intake and cancer growth. This study, which initially perplexed many, including Dr. Colin Campbell, laid the groundwork for a significant shift in understanding the relationship between animal protein and cancer.\nDr. Campbell's subsequent research, including the comprehensive China Study, underscored the detrimental effects of animal proteins, particularly from dairy, on our health. These findings advocate for minimizing dairy and animal protein consumption in diets exceeding 8% total protein, especially in affluent societies with abundant food choices.\nIt's important to recognize that dairy products do not cause cancer - they only contribute to its progression. The initiation of cancer is primarily due to gene mutations, which can result from a variety of factors such as radiation and toxic chemicals present in our environment. This suggests that cancer-causing agents were less prevalent in ancient times.\nIn scenarios of food scarcity, dairy protein can be considered a viable nutritional option. Historically milk likely played a crucial role during times of famine, potentially saving many communities from extinction. It is also worth noting that gene mutations caused by toxic chemicals and radiation were presumably less common in the past due to the limited presence of these harmful agents.\nIn 1967, the per capita milk consumption in India was 107 ml per person- today it has quadrupled to 427 ml per person. This increase occurred despite widespread knowledge of milk's potential role in promoting health issues, including cancer. While the Government of India recognized Dr. Gopalan's contributions with the Padma Bhushan award, his advice on this matter was not heeded.\nWhy Milk Today is Harmful Compared to The Past\nToday's dairy products differ significantly from those our ancestors consumed and we face different health challenges. Factors contributing to the harm caused by modern dairy include industrial farming practices, the genetic composition of dairy cows and the increased presence of environmental carcinogens. Additionally, lifestyle changes and increased life expectancy call for a reevaluation of dairy's role in our diet. Here are some examples:\n* Dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination.\n* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.\n* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield.\n* They are injected with high-dose antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions.\nAll these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk cows produce and are very harmful to human health.\nLife expectancy in the olden days was low and an age of 70-80 was considered a life long lived. Very few lived beyond that. Today we are talking about increasing human life expectancy to 100+ years like in Blue Zones.\nI have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Michael Gregor. They all are against consuming dairy products. Dr. Collin Campbell did concede that if the total protein in a diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay to consume as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows.\nWhy Dairy Is Unhealthy?\nNumerous studies and expert opinions highlight dairy's potential health risks including its ineffectiveness in bone health, its link to cancer, and its contribution to various diseases and conditions. Widespread lactose intolerance further underscores dairy's unsuitability for many. Here are some specific examples:\n(1) There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries in Africa which have the lowest rate of milk consumption also have the lowest rate of osteoporosis. Conversely, countries consuming the most milk have the  highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers.\n(2) Dairy consumption increases the body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks.\n(3) According to a 2006 study by Harvard researchers, conducted with 10,000 women aged 26-46, the women who consumed the most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy product consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer.\n(4) Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body.\n(5) Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body.\n(6) Milk and cheese can cause acne.\n(7) Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases.\n(8) Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome.\n(9) Dairy is a cause of autoimmune diseases like arthritis.\n(10) Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant.\n(11) Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes.\n(12) Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation.\n(13) Other problems associated with dairy include allergies and sinus issues.\n(14) Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet.\nCalcium Myth\nContrary to popular belief, the calcium in dairy is not efficiently absorbed due to its unfavorable phosphorus to calcium ratio. In order to absorb calcium one needs a calcium product that is conducive to absorption. The presence of phosphorus binds calcium to make calcium phosphate and biphosphate and diphosphate and makes it unavailable for absorption. To absorb calcium it must be available without phosphorus and milk does not provide that. So, for the most part, the calcium in the milk is in nonabsorbable. This is the reason why milk does not help people with osteoporosis. It even hurts them.\nGiving calcium pills as supplement also doesn’t help people with osteoporosis. Calcium just goes through the body and is excreted. Even vitamin D supplementation does not help.\nOne has to do something to the bones to get calcium inside the bones. All the trials of supplementing calcium with vitamin D have failed.\nDr. Lustig of UCSF recommends giving calcium to phosphorus in ratio of 4:1 whereas in milk it is 1:2.\nTo achieve satisfactory calcium absorption other forms of calcium are required like calcium chloride or citrate.\nHere are some additional comments that support PBWF doctors' view against dairy.\n* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and even headaches after giving up dairy.\n* Dr. Neil Bernard filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order.\n* The US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in its dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health was one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and had called them “utterly ridiculous”.\n* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia.\nConclusion\nDespite its historical role in human nutrition, the evidence against dairy consumption's health benefits is compelling. Alternatives to dairy, including plant-based milks and yogurts, offer nutritious and safe options for those seeking to avoid dairy's pitfalls. Acknowledging both the scientific findings and the cultural practices surrounding dairy consumption can guide us towards healthier dietary choices.

        "content": "•Myth: A CALORIE IS A CALORIE\nThe belief that all calories are equal is a widespread myth, even among the well-educated segments of our society. This notion is heavily promoted by the processed food industry to justify the increasing presence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. The argument posits that the source of calories—whether from protein, fat, carbohydrates, or whether the food is whole or refined, cooked or raw—is irrelevant. What matters, according to this myth, is the balance between calories consumed and expended, with any excess supposedly stored as fat in our bodies.\nThis perspective simplifies the issue to a matter of energy balance: consume more than you expend, and you'll gain weight. Consequently, the narrative absolves processed foods of blame, placing the onus on individual discipline to \"eat less and exercise more.\" It reduces dietary advice to avoiding gluttony and laziness, suggesting that any calorie can fit into a balanced diet.\nHowever, Dr. Robert Lustig from UCSF—one of the few remaining independent medical schools in the U.S.—has extensively researched this topic. He points out and I quote “This is the biggest lie in the history of medicine.\" The food industry's vested interest in perpetuating this myth has misled many into believing it's an incontrovertible truth. For instance, the sugar industry once advertised that three teaspoons of sugar were less fattening than an apple, diverting criticism from sugar to other foods.\nThe Fallacy of Portion Control\nThe \"A Calorie is a Calorie\" mantra suggests that a daily deficit of 500 calories should lead to losing one pound per week. However, many people find their weight loss stalls after initial success, leading to frustration. This phenomenon occurs because the human body, intelligent and adaptable, reduces its metabolic rate when it senses a food shortage—a survival mechanism honed over millennia. Our basal metabolic rate can drop, conserving energy during periods of scarcity, similar to how some animals hibernate.\nNot All Consumed Food is Absorbed\nThe first thing to understand is that it is not the calories consumed that matter, it is the calories absorbed that matter. How many calories get absorbed in the body is a function of many factors. Firstly the speed at which the digested food travels through the small intestine and secondly the absorption rate while this food is traveling through the small intestine. Both of these are a function of fiber content of the food. Plant based whole food (PBWF) is full of fiber and as a result it has high motility and travels through the small intestine, where most of the absorption takes place, quite fast. PBWF also has nutrients embedded inside fibers that take time to be extracted. As a result the PBWF gets absorbed only partially and the balance reaches the colon where it feeds the microbes which in turn make essential nutrients for the body. A good example of this is resistant starch present in beans.  When beans are consumed, a significant portion of calories don’t get absorbed in small intestines (hence the title resistant) and move on to colon where our microbes feed on them.  This is also called the second meal effect.\nAnother good example is that of almonds. There are 165 calories in an ounce of almonds but when we eat them, only 135 get absorbed. Where do the other 30 calories go? The fiber in the almonds\nIs both soluble and insoluble. The insoluble fiber forms a mesh like a fishnet and soluble fiber forms a gel which is filling the wholes in the net. Together they create a barrier in the upper part of small intestine which restricts the absorption of starch and glucose into liver. The liver therefore does not get overloaded and new fat is not formed from the fructose which in the absence of fiber does get formed in a process  called de novo lipogenesis (DNL)\nDNL is a complex and highly regulated process in which carbohydrates from circulation are converted into fatty acids that are then used for synthesizing either triglycerides or other lipid molecules. DNL helps keep the sugar and insulin levels down. High insulin level is very harmful as it drives abnormal growth. It drives vascular muscle growth that leads to coronary artery disease. It also causes prostate growth. The 30 calories that did not get absorbed go to the colon where our microbes feed on them.\nAs you can see from two examples above, the calories eaten are not necessarily calories absorbed. This explains why a calorie is not a calorie.\nFood Processing and Its Impact\nThe way food is processed before consumption also affects its health impact. The same 100 calories from sugarcane can vary greatly in their effect on health depending on whether they're consumed as fruit, juice, jaggery, or white sugar.\nPBWF vs. Refined Food\nRefined foods are devoid of fiber as a result they (1) move slower through small intestines taking longer to reach colon and (2) they get absorbed readily as the intestines don’t have to work as hard to extract nutrients from the mesh of fibers. This dual effect makes most of the calories get absorbed in small intestines only, leaving nothing or little for the microbes waiting in the colon. The microbes in colon, when regularly deprived of fibers and starch, start to feed on mucosal layers creating a breach exposing intact protein in food to colon lining made of tight junction epithelial cells. A leak through this layer causes various auto immune diseases.\nCircadian Rhythm\nThe timing of calorie consumption  also matters due to our body's circadian rhythms, affecting how food is processed at different times of the day. Recent (2017) Nobel Prize-winning research has shed light on these mechanisms, highlighting the importance of synchronizing. Dr. Satchin Panda’s research at the Salk Institute in SanDiego has shown that carbohydrates consumed during daytime are handled differently than during night. During daytime they are kept as readily available glucose in the blood and during night they are quickly converted into triglycerides and stored away as fat.\nMacronutrient as a Sources of Calories\nThe source of calories—whether from proteins, fats, or carbohydrates—significantly influences health outcomes. Calories from proteins, for example, affect the body differently than those from fats or carbohydrates. Even within a single macronutrient category like carbohydrates, the impact varies based on the type, such as starch, glucose, or fructose.\nCalories From Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates, which include starches, glucose, and fructose, are metabolized differently in the liver. Starches are converted into glucose by the liver and distributed throughout the body. Table sugar, comprises equally of glucose and fructose and they are processed differently by the liver. Glucose circulates in the blood, while fructose can be converted into glucose for energy or into fat for storage, depending on need which is judged by insulin levels. High insulin levels signifies the sufficiency of glucose in the blood and prompts the liver to convert fructose into fat, which can be stored in subcutaneous fat cells or, if the process is overwhelmed, lead to ectopic fat deposits. This can contribute to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), visceral fat accumulation, and insulin resistance, the main cause of type 2 diabetes.\nSo once again you can see that a calorie is not a calorie. Glucose calorie is kept as readily usable glucose but fructose calorie may be stored as fat.\nCalories from  Protein\nHuman body is very efficient in recycling protein as a result the protein requirement by the body is rather minimal. So liver converts all extra protein into fat or carbohydrates by a process called deamination. Deamination is the opposite of amination and it is a type of post-translational modification (PTM) in which an amine group is removed from a protein. This process creates organic acids which provide energy (ATP) to cells.\nThis process costs energy, in fact twice as much energy as what it takes to burn carbohydrates. So the net result is that protein provides less calories than carbohydrates, by some estimates as much as 30% less. This explains the popularity of keto diets but this extra burden on liver and kidneys leads to problems in those organs as we age.\nCalories from Fat\nAll fats are 9 calories per gram but it is wrong to think that all fats are equal. Omega-3 fats are very healthy fats but trans-fats are very unhealthy. Trans-fats cannot be broken down by our body cells into energy (ATP).\nWhen we run out of glucose stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, the body can use fat to provide energy. Theoretically it is correct however in practice the body first sends hunger pangs as a signal to consume more sugar or starch (which provide glucose more readily) before digging into it’s reservoir of fat which is kept for rainy day when food may not be available. So this is another reason a calorie is not a calorie.\nMyth: Exercising Alone Will Take Care of My Health\nOne common myth many young people, who exercise regularly, have is that “Nothing wrong can happen to them because they physically work out regularly”. As a result they become lax in dietary discipline. The data shows that about half of the people, who die after their first heart attack, have no signs of cardiovascular disease. Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF points this out clearly in his book Metabolical suggesting that of the 8 mechanisms for a healthy body, exercise helps only 4. Food is most important for good health and must not be neglected.\nConclusion\nAs you can see from explanations given above, it is not only what food you eat that matters, it is also what is done to the food and what your body’s metabolic response is to the food that matters. This underscores the principle that not all calories are equivalent, highlighting the importance of considering the source and type of macronutrients in dietary choices.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

Unlike handling excess nutrients, our bodies struggle with deficiencies. Relying on inorganic or organic supplements to address these deficiencies can disrupt our body’s balance.\nFood Supplements Industry\nIn the United States alone the food supplements industry boasts a revenue exceeding $160 billion and is expected to reach $265 billion by 2030. This industry thrives on confusion and doubt, funding studies to make you question your nutrient intake and promote supplement use.\nDepletion of Soil\nIt is an acknowledged fact that today’s plant foods are not as nutrient-rich due to factors like river damming for hydropower, monoculture farming and inorganic fertilizers. These practices deplete essential trace minerals in the soil. When we use inorganic fertilizers, the focus is only on a few key nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium etcetera. This depletes the trace minerals in the soil and the food it produces. When we use compost made of human and animal waste these trace minerals are recycled back into soil.\nThe arguments presented by the food supplements industry to point out nutrition depletion in modern plant produce are valid arguments. What is not valid is why should one take supplements instead of eating another carrot or apple to make up for mineral depletion. People are eating fewer fruits and vegetables compared to our grandparents generation. They actually should be eating more to make up for deficiency in nutrients. Eating refined and ultra processed foods further reduce the nutrients in our diet. Our diets are becoming calorie rich and nutrient poor. This is one of the reasons why organic food is richer in trace minerals (besides of course the absence of pesticides). This is also the reason why food grown in the wild, like wild berries, is much healthier.\nWhat About Not-Yet-Known (NYKnown) Nutrients?\nA major problem with supplements is that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about. But there are likely to be many more nutrients in food which have not yet been discovered. So when we take supplements, it creates imbalances in the not-yet-known nutrients.\nBeta Carotene Study\nTo make my point I like to give the example of Beta Carotene, which is from a family of carotenoids. Beta Carotene was discovered almost two centuries ago and has since been believed to be an important nutrient, just like vitamin C, for heart health. Many cardiologists have been prescribing Beta Carotene supplementation for heart health. However a major study recently revealed that the groups of patients who received Beta Carotene supplementation were dying early compared to the groups that did not. This was quite perplexing and further analysis showed that there are actually 750 types of carotenoids and the human body needs about fifty of them. Our body cells have limited receptors to receive these carotenoids. When we supplement only one carotenoid like Beta Carotene, the receptors get flooded with this carotenoid, not leaving enough room to receive other 49 carotenoids. This created deficiency in these other carotenoids among those groups who received supplementation and led to earlier deaths.\nSymphony of Nutrients\nNutrients behave in complex ways with other nutrients. Reducing them to a single nutrient at a time and consuming does not replicate those processes. As elaborated by Dr Colin Campbell in the documentary “Forks over Knives”, all nutrients work in a synergism, like various instruments in a symphony. Often you don’t even hear the individual instruments, but the symphony is very pleasing and sounds beautiful. To isolate one instrument and enhance it can spoil the symphony. Each of our bodies is like a symphony played out with various nutrients. We know now, after the discovery of Epigenetics, that each one of us has a very different microbiome composition. So it is like each one of us has a body playing out our individual symphony.\nThere are many other examples of nutrient imbalances. Here are few more:\n1. Taking Calcium supplements depletes Magnesium because Magnesium is required by the body to absorb Calcium.\n2. Taking Zinc supplements reduces Copper absorbability and taking Copper supplement creates imbalance in Zinc.\n3. Presence of Phosphorus reduces calcium absorbability as in dairy milk.\nImpact on Liver & Kidney\nAfter food is absorbed in the small intestines all supplements consumed first go to liver, which is the chemical factory in our body. The supplements get metabolized there and filtered through the kidneys. This increases the load on these vital organs, reducing their healthy lifespan. This impact is only noticeable once we reach an old age.\nHow trace minerals and many micro nutrients affect our body is a science that is not fully understood yet, and lot more research has to be done. So the safest approach is to avoid all supplements. Vitamin B12 is the only exception because the municipal water supply that we consume is all chlorinated and kills the bacteria that produces vitamin B12.\nFalse Sense of Security\nTaking supplements can also create a false sense of security and makes us pay less attention to our diet. All nutrient deficiencies should be compensated by consuming balanced meals. We must add foods to our diet that we have been missing. My recommendation is to eat multiple varieties in each food group and specially green leafy vegetables, berries, flaxseeds and walnuts.\nReductionist Approach\nAs the science of nutrition evolved a century ago our focus was on understanding the roles of various nutrients in our body’s functioning.\nThe human mind has limitations and it works better in understanding linear correlations. As a result we tended towards a reductionist approach to nutrition. The role of Vitamin C became clear based on research on sailors who were deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for extended periods and developed scurvy. The food industry was quick to provide solutions by isolating vitamins to make up for the deficiencies. Creating and propagating this reductionist and deficiency mindset serves the purpose of the Processed Food and Supplements industry well. Nutrition science has focused on these two approaches for the past century and, in spite of the wealth of academic knowledge on nutrition and chronic diseases, one does not see any dent in the growth of such diseases. It begs the question \"Why is that so?\" One explanation is that the field of nutrition has become more about marketing profitable products than educating people about the fundamentals of health and wellness.\nThere is a tendency on many people’s part, who are health conscientious, to look for ways to supplement their diet with healthy supplements. How does one define healthy supplements? Some think plant-based supplements are healthy and others think Ayurvedic or homeopathic supplements are healthy.\nTypical Indian Meal Plan\nA cursory analysis of a typical Indian diet plan shows that we Indians consume over half of our calories from refined and processed foods which are empty calories. Replacing these empty calories with nutrient rich calories from plant based whole foods can easily take care of any nutritional deficiencies and should be the way to go.\nAmerican Gut Project\nA recent study known as the American Gut project (2013-2018) which involved participants from 45 countries showed some interesting results. It concluded that people who consumed a wide variety of plant based foods (over 30 varieties each week) were much healthier than those who consumed few (less than 10 varieties each week). Their immunity from infections diseases was also the highest in the first group. It is for this reason, I recommend that we should try to consume at least seven varieties in each of the five food group each week. The five food groups being Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Beans & Legumes and Nuts & Seeds. Besides this, one should also eat as many spices as one can each week.\nConclusion\nNutrition is about the synergy of a diverse diet, not just supplementing with isolated nutrients. Embrace variety, focus on whole foods, and question the necessity of supplements for a balanced and healthy lifestyle.\nDr. Colin Campbell, who is considered the top nutritionist in the world today, emphasizes that one must unlearn everything one has come to know about nutrients and only remember that:\n“FOOD, NOT NUTRIENTS, IS THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT IN NUTRITION.”\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "BASICS OF PHYSIOLOGY\nAfter exploring various myths about diet and lifestyle, we will now delve into the fundamentals of human physiology and nutrition. Every living organism, from single cells to primates, has two primary objectives: (1) survival and (2) propagation. For survival, two elements are crucial, which in Vedanta are termed PRANA and APANA. Prana represents the life-giving force, including food and air (oxygen) for energy, while Apana refers to the elimination of waste produced by metabolism, driven by Prana. In this and the next three blog posts, we will examine the four basic systems of human physiology:\n1. Gastrointestinal Tract: It ingests and processes food.\n2. Respiratory System: It inhales fresh air and exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide.\n3. Blood Circulatory System: It distributes nutrients and oxygen to every cell in the body.\n4. Lymphatic System: It acts like a janitorial system, removing waste from all body parts due to metabolic processes.\nGASTROINTESTINAL TRACT\nThis tract is the path from our mouth to the anus, through which food passes, is consumed, digested, absorbed, and eventually, waste is excreted.\nAs depicted in the pictures below, food enters our mouth where it is mixed with saliva and chewed into a fine slurry before moving through the esophagus to the stomach via a sphincter valve. In the stomach, food mixes with acids and digests over a period that can range from two to six hours. The total transit time of food, from ingestion to defecation, can vary from 10 to 72 hours, primarily depending on the type of food and gut health. Here's a breakdown:\n- Gastric emptying: 2-6 hrs.\n- Small Intestine transit: 2-6 hrs.\n- Colonic transit: 6-60 hrs.\n- Total Gut transit: 10 to 72 hrs.\nThis transit time largely depends on how nutrients are embedded within the food's fibers. Food lacking fiber moves slowly but is quickly absorbed. In contrast, plant-based whole foods move quickly due to the motility created by undigested fibers but are absorbed slowly, as extracting nutrients like sugars and starches from fibers takes time. This dynamic results in a significant challenge for animal and processed foods, as they are quickly and completely absorbed, leading to liver overload and potential weight gain, with little left for the colon's microbial inhabitants.\nWhen this pattern repeats, our microbial guests become starved and agitated, starting to consume the mucosal layer they inhabit, eventually leading to inflammation and conditions like \"Leaky Gut Syndrome\" or \"Irritable Bowel Disorder.\"\nEPITHELIAL CELL LINING\nThe human gastrointestinal tract is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells with tight junctions, protected by an inner mucus layer containing goblet cells that produce mucus. Adjacent to this inner layer is an outer mucus layer, home to various microbes.\nThe importance and roles of these colon microbes are becoming increasingly clear, giving rise to a new field called epigenetics. Surprisingly, our bodies host more foreign cells (38 trillion microbes) than our own cells (37 trillion). These microbes play a significant role in our health, overshadowing our genetic makeup. This was highlighted in the January 14, 2010, issue of TIME magazine.\n\"Microbiota\" refers to the collective microbes (sometimes called a microbial garden), with \"Microbiome\" denoting their genetic makeup. These terms are often used interchangeably. An analogy to understand the human microbiome versus genome is comparing computer hardware and software: despite similar hardware, the software dictates the functionality, akin to how our epigenome, the body's software, influences gene expression.\nTo make my point clear I like to give an example of cell phones.\nAll cell phones in use today are very similar in terms of hardware however, how this hardware expresses itself visually on the screen or audibly on the speaker depends upon what software is being used. For example Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram all express very differently on the same phone. So our epigenome is our body’s software and it determines how our genes are expressing at any given moment.\nThis understanding is revolutionizing medical science, leading to groundbreaking practices like fecal transplantation which was not even in the realm of our wildest imagination. An overweight woman, who has tried everything in her life to lose weight, loses weight simply upon receipt of a fecal transplantation from a slim woman. Some of the lessons we have learned with this new science suggest:\n1. Same cause can manifest as different symptoms in different people.\n2. Same symptoms can be due to different causes in different people therefore diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science distraught with many hits and misses.\n4. A different diet for different diseases doesn’t make sense but a different diet for different individuals could make sense. It is conceivable that soon in future, we may create meal plans based on one’s fecal sample analysis.\nRefined vs. Whole Food\nConsider the example of identical twins T1 and T2, consuming the same ingredients (wheat, peanuts, and apples) in different forms for breakfast. T1 opts for porridge in peanut milk with fresh apples, while T2 consumes refined flour kachori fried in peanut oil with apple juice. T1 maintains health, but T2 may gain weight and risk developing diabetes, liver, and kidney issues. This disparity arises because T1's body might leave some calories for the microbiome, keeping them happy and satisfied, whereas T2's body absorbs all calories in the small intestine, leaving nothing for microbial digestion. This causes microbes to consume the mucosal layer in which they reside. Over time, this can lead to leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\nSugar spikes due to Apple juice and refined flour would result in new fat formation in liver (de novo lipogenesis) causing non alcoholic fatty liver disease and visceral fat and insulin resistance (Diabetes type-2). Ultimately both the kidney and liver will be affected shortening his lifespan.\nThe impact of diet on health is profound, yet often overlooked, with many attributing health issues to bad luck. However, chronic diseases are less about luck and more about the consequences of dietary choices, particularly the consumption of refined and highly processed foods.\nConclusion\nThe transition from whole foods to refined and processed options during the past century is a primary contributor to lifestyle-related diseases. These diseases affect our body on a daily basis in small ways that are rarely noticeable until it is often too late. They are not impervious as we often like to believe. Taking medications to suppress symptoms is not the solution. The diet has to be modified.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Basics of Physiology (2)\nRESPIRATORY SYSTEM\nYesterday we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract, which provides the essential nutrients our bodies need to sustain themselves. These nutrients require oxygen to metabolize and produce energy. The respiratory system is crucial in delivering fresh oxygen to the body and expelling carbon dioxide. While the respiratory system is also involved in sound production and the sense of smell, our focus here will be on the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nWhen we inhale through our nose or mouth, the air travels down the trachea into the lungs, where it divides into multiple branches called bronchioles, eventually reaching tiny sacs known as alveoli. The human lung contains over 600 million alveoli, with their combined surface area roughly equivalent to a tennis court.\nSurrounding the alveoli are blood capillaries that carry blood from various body parts. This blood is rich in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs across the alveolar membrane and the capillary walls through diffusion. The picture below shows how an alveolar capillary exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen.\nDiminished Surface Area\nAt birth, the surfaces of the alveoli and capillaries are pristine, maximizing gas exchange efficiency. However, over time, two significant changes occur. First, dust and pollutant particles accumulate on the alveolar lining, reducing the area available for gas exchange. Second, the capillaries' inner linings develop plaque due to the consumption of inflammatory foods, further diminishing the available surface area. As we age, the reduction in surface area becomes more pronounced, leading to breathing difficulties, a condition known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\nIt is important to understand that obstruction is happening on both sides of that one tennis court size surface of all 600 million plus alveoli of the lung.\nThe obstruction on the capillary wall is due to atherosclerosis which is classified as a cardiovascular disease.\nThe discomfort one experiences in breathing is due to the combination of these two phenomenons working together.\nHistorically, main pollutants like dust and coal particles from wood and charcoal burning prompted people to seek cleaner air in sanatoriums as they aged.\nDiminished Breathing Capacity\nBreathing capacity is another crucial factor. The average lung holds about 6 liters of air, but only a fraction is used during normal breathing. This capacity, which varies among individuals and even within the same person over time, increases with physical activity. Enhancing respiratory capacity through active lifestyles can improve conditions like COPD, as physical activity can help revive some collapsed alveoli.\nSymptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, wheezing, and a chronic cough. The cough is a mechanism by which body clears obstructions, but when these consist of fine particles, the condition becomes persistent. That is why it is called chronic.\nNitric Oxide Gas to Rescue\nConsuming green leafy vegetables and beetroots, which are high in nitrates, release nitric oxide in the blood vessels, aiding in the removal of atherosclerotic damage and improving gas exchange. These vegetables can be consumed as salad or green juice. Additionally, Pranayama breathing exercises like Bhastrika and Kapalbhati can help alleviate respiratory obstructions, offering benefits for those with respiratory conditions.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Basics of Physiology (3)\nBLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\nIn our past two sessions, we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract and the Respiratory System, which provide the nutrients and oxygen necessary for survival.\nOnce absorbed, these nutrients need to be transported to every part of the human body, a task accomplished by the blood circulatory system.\nThis system is comprised of a heart that acts as a pump and approximately 70,000 miles of blood vessels, evenly split between arteries (which carry blood from the heart to all body parts) and veins (which return the blood to the heart). At the site where the blood is delivered, these vessels narrow into thin capillaries.\nThe blood vessels' internal lining consists of a single layer of endothelial cells. This network is so extensive that the total surface area of this lining equals about 6-8 tennis courts. Collectively, this surface is known as the endothelium, arguably the largest organ in the human body. When the heart pumps blood, it causes the blood vessels to expand slightly due to pressure, which then drops, causing the vessels to shrink. These fluctuations are known as systolic and diastolic blood pressures.\nNitric Oxide Gas\nA unique feature of the endothelial lining is its ability to release nitric oxide (NO) gas, facilitating smooth blood flow. When blood vessels develop plaque, the effective opening narrows, increasing the friction and, consequently, the blood pressure needed to maintain blood flow.\nEvolution Time Line\nOur bodies have evolved over billions of years. In a hypothetical 500-page book about human evolution, the domestication of animals and the advent of agriculture would appear only in the last paragraph of the final page. I mention this to address common arguments advocating animal-based foods, despite the facts.\nWhat is Inflammation?\nInflammation is the body's reaction to perceived threats, which may not always be genuine. For instance, consider everyday activities that pose no danger because they are familiar. When we rise early in the morning, there are numerous routines we follow that do not alarm us because they are habitual, and we recognize the individuals involved. For instance, a sweeper cleans the street, a newspaper delivery person brings the newspaper, and the regular housekeeper rings the doorbell, to which we respond by letting her in.\nImagine a scenario where the doorbell rings again, and through the peephole, you see a tall, unfamiliar figure. This might trigger a sense of alarm or perceived threat. You might whisper to your spouse to stay silent, pretending no one is home, in hopes the stranger will leave. Alternatively, if your spouse is a retired military officer, he might retrieve a firearm from a safe and loudly inquire who's at the door. There could be various responses to this situation. The individual outside may pose no actual threat and could be a new neighbor seeking directions to the university. Nonetheless, the critical point here is the perception of threat and the consequent reaction, which is analogous to inflammation. In this metaphor, the situation is inflammatory, prompting an 'inflamed' response, which represents inflammation.\nInflammatory Foods\nConsuming plant-based whole foods, which have been part of our diet for millions of years, does not alarm the body. However, introducing animal products, refined, or ultra-processed foods, which are relatively new to our diet, triggers an inflammatory response. Such foods can compromise the integrity of the endothelial lining, leading to the formation of plaques as a repair mechanism.\nATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThis process is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis starts early, as soon as children transition from breast milk to solid foods. Continuous consumption of inflammatory foods promotes plaque buildup, narrowing blood vessels and leading to increased blood pressure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and likely worldwide.\nGreen Leafy Vegetables To The Rescue\nGreen leafy vegetables are very rich in nitrates. When we consume them as salads or green juice, they release nitric oxide in the blood, helping unclog the blood vessels. This effect has been demonstrated by Dr. Caldwell Esselystyn of the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Dean Ornish of UCSF, showing potential in reversing cardiovascular diseases and reducing dependency on medications.\nOne must understand that lifestyle diseases are not random phenomena and they do not develop all of a sudden. They exist on a continuum and the markers like BP are body’s way of compensating for them. Lowering the markers with medication whether Allopathic, Homeopathic, Unani or Ayurvedic is not the solution. One must address the cause which is almost always our diet and lifestyle.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "(4) LYMPHATIC SYSTEM\nSo far we have discussed how nutrients, essential for life, are consumed and distributed throughout the body. With the help of these nutrients every cell performs its metabolic function and in the process creates waste. The gaseous waste carbon dioxide is removed by the respiratory system but other waste is excreted as sweat, urine and feces. The system that collects this waste and takes it to the organs that excrete it (kidney, colon and skin) is called the Lymphatic System. It consists of a large network of lymphatic vessels throughout the body which merge into lymph nodes, lymphoid organs, lymphoid tissues and lymph.\nThe lymphatic system is also part of the immune system. It keeps body fluid levels in balance and defends the body against infections. The way the lymphatic system functions is by removing fluids (other than blood) from body tissues and cleaning it and recycling it.\nMany of the lymph nodes reside in our underarms and where our legs join the body. Interestingly the lymphatic system does not have a pump and relies heavily on the body’s movement specially the hands and the legs.\nThis is one reason why the regular movement of hands and legs is very important. The important function of walking is often neglected by most writers while criticizing the 10,000 steps recommendation. Ideally these steps should be spread throughout the day as much as possible.\nWith this discussion, we've covered four critical systems of human physiology. Next week, we'll delve into the basics of nutrition.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•BASICS OF NUTRITION•\nHaving discussed the basics of physiology, describing how nutrients are ingested and distributed throughout the body and waste is collected and excreted, we will now delve into the types of nutrients and their role in bodily functions. Nutrients are categorized into three groups:\n1. Macronutrients: Provide energy.\n2. Micronutrients: Provide essential nutrients without energy.\n3. Other Nutrients\n1.0 MACRO NUTRIENTS\nMacronutrients are energy-providing nutrients, measured in kilocalories but often referred to as calories. The three macronutrients are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.\n1.1 Proteins\nWe previously discussed proteins in the context of nutrition myths. To recap, proteins, providing 4 calories per gram, are vital for every cell. They consist of chains of twenty different amino acids in various permutations and combinations. Out of these, nine are essential, meaning our body cannot synthesize them, so they must be ingested through food. A typical human body utilizes approximately 200 grams of protein daily, recycling about 85% of it, leaving a deficit of about 30 grams. The body lacks a storage system for proteins; excess intake is converted into fat and nitrogen in the liver. The fat is stored subcutaneously, while nitrogen is transformed into ammonia, then uric acid, and finally excreted as urine. Excessive protein intake can strain the liver and kidneys, shortening their productive life. This is the reason why dialysis is becoming so common among the baby boomer generation.\n1.2 Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, providing four calories per gram. They include starch, glucose, fructose, lactose, and glycerols. Starch is converted into glucose in the liver, which is then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream. The liver can convert fructose into glucose or fat, depending upon the need of the body. This key difference plays an important role in\ninfluencing metabolism significantly.\n1.3 Fats\nFats, offering nine calories per gram, are a dense energy source and the preferred storage form for excess calories. Fats are categorized by saturation level or chain length:\n• Saturated Fats: Each carbon atom is bonded to hydrogen, predominantly found in animal products and considered unhealthy in excess.\n• Monounsaturated Fats: Contain one double bond and are found in plant foods like nuts, seeds and avocados, beneficial for health.\n• Polyunsaturated Fats: Contain multiple double bonds. These include essential omega-3 and omega-6 fats. Of the two, Omega-6 is found in plenty in nature but Omega-3 is scarcer so special attention needs to be paid. Our body needs both omega-3 and omega-6 in equal amounts.\nMany vegetable oils are too rich in omega-6 and have hardly any omega-3.  Any ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 higher than 3 is problematic and should be avoided. The richest plant based sources of Omega-3 are Flaxseeds, Chia seeds, Hempseeds, Mustard seeds and walnuts. Mustard which is found in abundance has an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 3:1 which is very healthy. That is why mustard seeds should be consumed regularly and mustard oil is the least harmful of all oils.\n• Trans Fats: When oils undergo hydrogenation, they transform into a solid form at room temperature. These hydrogenated oils are known as trans fats and are highly detrimental to health. They gained popularity at the turn of the 19th century when saturated animal fats were discouraged due to heart health concerns. Trans fats are commonly found in products like vegetable shortening and margarine. Owing to their adverse health effects many countries, including the U.S., have banned them. However, they are still permitted in India. Dalda, introduced in India about a century ago, is a prominent example of trans fats; in the U.S., Crisco is a well-known equivalent.\nFats can also be classified by the length of the fatty acid chains, which can be short, medium, long, or extra-long. When we consume whole plant-based foods fiber is digested by bacteria in the lining of our colon, producing short and medium-chain fatty acids that are beneficial to our health.\n(2) MICRONUTRIENTS\nMicronutrients are crucial for health but they do not provide any energy. They include following:\n2.1 Vitamins\nVitamins are essential organic compounds that the body requires in small amounts for nutrition. There is a variety of vitamins readily available in plant-based foods. However, two vitamins that warrant particular attention are B12 and D3. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria found in soil, which can enter our bodies through groundwater or direct contact with the soil, such as when farming barehanded and barefoot. In modern times, we often avoid direct contact with soil, and our water, sourced from municipal tanks, is chlorinated, killing all bacteria. Consequently, B12 deficiency is quite common among vegans. Although B12 is present in green water plants, commonly known as seaweeds, which make a regular part of diets in Japan, Korea and China, they are not consumed in India and the rest of the world. These seaweeds can also be good sources of vitamin D3 and Iodine.\n2.2 Minerals\nMinerals are found in air, water, and soil and plants absorb them effectively. These minerals enter our bodies through plant-based foods. However, the use of inorganic fertilizers and practices like monoculture farming can deplete the soil of these vital nutrients and seeds leading to deficiencies in our diet. To counteract this, it is crucial to consume organically grown produce and utilize rock salts, which are abundant in trace minerals. Among these, iodine deserves special attention. It is advisable to incorporate iodine-enriched salts into your diet to ensure adequate intake.\n2.3 Antioxidants\nWhen various metabolic reactions occur in our body, they often release a single atom of oxygen. These oxygen atoms are highly reactive and can cause oxidation of other molecules nearby, leading to a phenomenon known as oxidative stress. Certain chemical compounds, known as antioxidants, are effective in neutralizing these single oxygen atoms. Many plant foods are abundant in antioxidants and consuming them can help reduce oxidative stress. While all fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, berries, leafy greens, herbs, and spices are particularly rich sources and should be included in one's daily diet.\n2.4 Phytonutrients\nPhytonutrients are phytochemical compounds produced by plants to protect themselves against attacks from fungi, bacteria and plant viruses, as well as from insects and other small animals. In large concentrations, some of these compounds can also be poisonous. Approximately 10,000 different phytochemicals have been identified, but discussing them all is beyond the scope of this blog. However, I would like to highlight two of them: carotenoids and polyphenols. The most well-known carotenoid is beta-carotene, discovered nearly two centuries ago and linked to eye and heart health. It is found in carrots, hence the name carotene. Today, we understand that there are 750 different carotenoids, and the human body requires about 50 of them. Supplementing with beta-carotene was a common practice until recently, but it can lead to imbalances in the absorption of other carotenoids and should therefore be avoided.\nPolyphenols are phytonutrients that help protect body tissues against oxidative stress and associated pathologies, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, and inflammation.\n(3) WATER\nWater is an essential nutrient and must be consumed regularly. The human body does produce some water when it burns fat, but not enough to sustain itself. It is challenging to survive beyond a week or two without water. I recommend consuming two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, even before brushing your teeth. This practice is beneficial because our body produces saliva overnight, which is good for our health. We should swallow this saliva with water. Additionally, one should drink a glass of water an hour after every meal and another glass before going to bed. Except for the water consumed in the morning and at night, which should be drunk as is, it is a good habit to obtain most of your water intake from eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are primarily water anyway. Hence the saying \"eat your water.\"\n(4) FIBER\nFiber is an essential nutrient that is often misunderstood and neglected. Here are some key benefits of fiber:\n- Fiber aids in the motility of our intestines.\n- It slows down nutrient absorption in our small intestines, allowing certain foods, such as resistant starch, to reach the colon where they serve as nourishment for bacteria.\n- Fiber moderates the absorption of sugar in our liver, preventing its overload. An overloaded liver can lead to several issues, including (1) fatty liver, potentially progressing to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, (2) the accumulation of visceral fat, and (3) the formation of intramyocellular lipid, which can cause insulin resistance, leading to Type 2 diabetes.\n- Fiber supports the beneficial bacteria in our gut, helping them produce short- and medium-chain fatty acids, which are vital for our health.\nConclusion\nAll nutrients play a crucial role in our health, functioning in a complementary manner akin to a symphony performed by an orchestra. We should obtain these nutrients from plant-based foods, which are their primary sources. It is advisable to avoid secondary sources and supplements.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "FIVE PILLARS OF HEALTH\nWe have so far delved into numerous diet and lifestyle myths that often lead us astray. We've also touched on the essentials of human physiology and nutrition. Today, we embark on a series about what I term the \"five pillars of health,\" key components that bolster our well-being and aid in preventing and reversing many lifestyle-related diseases.\nThe advent of the light bulb and the discovery of antibiotics a century ago marked a societal shift, leading us to normalize disease as an inevitable aspect of aging. The light bulb disrupted our circadian rhythms, spawning numerous chronic health issues, while the triumph of penicillin over infectious diseases fostered a belief that a pill could be the panacea for all ailments.\nPost-World War II affluence ushered in an era of lifestyle diseases like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. When pills fell short, the medical and pharmaceutical sectors proposed a new narrative: chronic diseases were incurable, pinned on overindulgence and inactivity. Their solution was to manage these conditions by keeping their markers in check with ongoing medication and check-ups.\nMeanwhile, the rise of the processed food industry post-WWII, driven by shareholder profits, led to less nutritious, irresistible food options, contributing to a surge in health issues. This convergence of interests among the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, overlooked by government and media, has escalated chronic diseases to unprecedented levels, quietly normalizing this unhealthy status quo to a point where we have more sick people than healthy people in the civilized world.\nAcknowledging that diet and lifestyle are at the core of many chronic conditions begs the question: Why not change them?\nThe human body has an innate ability to heal, but relying on medications to mask symptoms interrupts this process, often leading to a cascade of further health complications. The spiral of illness thus created continues untill death.\nStudies of centenarians in \"Blue Zones\" debunk the myth that chronic diseases are a given in old age. These populations live well into their 90s and beyond, largely disease-free.\nThere is overpowering evidence that suggests that there are five pillars of health which contribute to prevention and reversal of most chronic diseases if not all.\n(1) Food\nOur 37 trillion cells require nourishment, which is compromised by modern food processing techniques. Removing fiber and adding harmful ingredients which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) disrupt our satiety signals and contribute to chronic illnesses.\nNotably, research indicates that a diet with more than 8% protein, particularly from animal sources, can promote cancer. Key dietary rules include avoiding animal products, refined foods, and ultra-processed items.\n(2) Detoxification\nThe food consumed is metabolized by cells throughout the body, producing waste that needs to be collected and excreted. The lymphatic system, nearly as extensive as the circulatory system, facilitates this process. The human brain can only eliminate metabolic waste during the deep sleep cycle at night. In addition to metabolic waste, our bodies also accumulate dead and damaged cells that can harm adjacent healthy cells. The Nobel Prize-winning research from 2016 demonstrated that fasting for over 22 hours induces a process called autophagy, where the body recycles such waste. Thus, it is highly recommended to fast every two weeks, aligning with the Indian tradition of Ekadashi fasts. Furthermore, another Nobel Prize-winning study in 2018 showed that prolonged fasting for 10 days, with only a small, especially low-protein meal each day, enhances immunity against serious diseases like cancer. This practice is strikingly similar to the Indian Navratri fasting tradition. Other yoga practices, such as Shatkarma, are also beneficial for detoxifying the body.\n(3) Circadian Rhythm\nAll species of plants and animals on Earth have evolved within a 24-hour day-night cycle and are well adapted to this rhythm. Many glands in our body release hormones in sync with these cycles, regulating various bodily functions. However, with the advent of electricity, our lifestyles have shifted away from the natural day-night rhythm, disrupting our body's synchronization with nature's clock. Notably, the 2017 Nobel Prize was awarded for research demonstrating how our body's master clock aligns with the day-night cycle. Dr. Satchin Panda's work at UC San Diego and the Salk Institute over the past decade has shed light on this topic. For optimal health, consider the following recommendations:\nSun Gazing: Rise before sunrise and, within half an hour of sunrise and sunset, gaze around the sun, moving your eyes in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. Avoid direct sun gazing.\nEating Patterns: Refrain from eating for at least an hour after sunrise and aim to finish dinner before sunset, or at least before it gets dark outside.\nPhysical Activity: Avoid strenuous workouts when it's dark outside.\nScreen Time: Minimize exposure to blue light-emitting screens, such as TVs, computer monitors, and cell phones at night, or use a blue light filter on these devices.\nSleep: Aim for a minimum of 8 hours of sleep per night. Avoid using an alarm to wake up, and compensate for any sleep deficit within the same week.\n(4) Physical Activity\nThe human body has evolved to accommodate a physically active lifestyle. The lymphatic system, which serves as our body's janitorial service, collects metabolic waste. However, unlike the blood circulatory system, it lacks a pump and depends on bodily movement to operate effectively. Therefore, it's essential to move regularly throughout the day. It is advised to engage in movement for 5 minutes every hour while awake. One method to monitor this is by counting your steps, aiming to reach at least 10,000 steps daily.\n(5)  Emotional & Spiritual Health\nHuman emotions trigger the release of hormones that benefit not only our emotional well-being but also our physical health. We commonly hear that laughter is the best medicine because it helps alleviate stress. Similarly, giving unconditional love and surrounding oneself with recipients of such love, like young children and pets, significantly impacts our health. Additionally, prayers filled with gratitude saturate our bodies with hormones that promote happiness and contentment. The act of praying is crucial, regardless of the deity or entity being addressed.\nThese five pillars of health, when consistently practiced and integrated into one's lifestyle, can help reverse many chronic diseases, if not all, and extend one's lifespan. This is similar to the patterns observed in various Blue Zones around the world, where people live over 100 years without diseases. Over next few weeks we will focus on these five pillars of health one at a time.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•First Pillar of Health•\nFOOD.\nThe most important of the five pillars of health is food. However, it's not just about what we eat; it also matters when we eat, how we eat, and what we do to our food before eating. My experience with 200,000 members has shown that a plant-based whole-food (PBWF) diet is optimal for humans. As we discuss the diet and lifestyle changes needed to treat chronic diseases, we must prioritize the bigger picture. Our goal is to significantly improve one’s health from its current state and to ideally eliminate the need for medications related to lifestyle diseases. My focus is on providing instructions that are simple and easy to remember. Here are my dietary recommendations:\n(1) Avoid Animal Foods\nNo meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or dairy-based products such as yogurt, cheese, and ghee. Here are the reasons for this recommendation:\n- Animal foods are rich in protein. As discussed in my earlier blog (February 11), excess protein must be converted into fat and nitrogen by the liver, then into ammonia and uric acid, causing the liver and kidneys to work harder, potentially leading to the need for dialysis and transplants in later years.\n- Animal protein includes IGF-1, a hormone that promotes rapid cell growth. For example, a newborn calf weighing 50 pounds can grow tenfold to become a 500-pound bull. While human cells cannot grow that fast due to genetic modulation, cancer cells can thrive in the presence of IGF-1.\nA metaphor I use is that while a lawn fed with potent fertilizer cannot grow faster, the weeds within it can. Similarly, tiny cancer cells in our body, common in most civilized populations, can grow rapidly due to IGF-1, thereby promoting cancer.\n- Animal foods lack fiber, which is essential for feeding the microbes in our colon, potentially leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\n- Animal foods are inflammatory and can cause atherosclerosis in our blood vessels, leading to various heart diseases.\n- The fat in animal food is mostly saturated fat, which is detrimental to cardiac health.\n(2) Avoid Refined Foods\n- Refined foods such as oils, sugar, and white flour are devoid of fiber, moving slowly through the intestines, leading to full absorption of macronutrients and leaving little for the microbes residing in the colon. This can cause the microbes to consume the mucosal layer that protects the internal lining of the colon, leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\n- Refined foods are quickly absorbed, overburdening our liver. This can lead to the formation of unwanted fat in the liver (causing fatty liver and NAFLD), visceral organs (visceral fat), and between muscle cells (intramyocellular lipids). Intramyocellular lipids block insulin receptors in our muscle cells, causing insulin resistance, a precursor to type-2 diabetes.\n(3) Avoid Ultra Processed Foods\nUltra-processed foods, like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), used as a sweetener in many processed foods, are devoid of fiber and contribute to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, they contain many chemicals labeled as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), yet they are not truly safe and cause numerous health issues. For instance, hydrogenated vegetable shortenings sold as margarine, and other products like Dalda and Crisco, have been found to be harmful and banned in many countries.\n(4)  Eat from all five food groups\nThe five food groups are fruits, vegetables, beans & legumes, grains, and nuts & seeds. Regular consumption of herbs & spices is also highly recommended. Aim to consume one-fifth of your daily caloric intake from each food group, though this can vary daily. To accelerate weight loss, consume only the minimum recommended amount from the Nuts & Seeds group. Aim to eat at least 1% of your body weight in fruits (including berries) and vegetables (half from green leafy vegetables) daily.\n(5) Five Nutrients Require  Special Attention\nMonitor these key nutrients closely: Omega-3, vitamins D-3, B-12, and K-2, and iodine. To ensure adequate Omega-3 intake, consume one tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia seeds, along with a few walnuts each day. Include a variety of seeds and nuts; try to eat one Brazil nut each week as it is rich in selenium and also include pumpkin seeds. Take a vitamin B-12 supplement—either 50-100 mcg daily or 2,000 mcg weekly. Vitamin D-3 is best obtained from sun exposure. Only take a D-3 supplement if you are deficient and do not get much sun exposure. For vitamin K2 consume some fermented foods and also sauerkraut. It also helps to consume some sea greens like seaweed and algae as they are rich in iodine, Omega-3 and can provide some vitamin D and B12. Some examples are wakame salad, nori and kelp flakes.\n(6) Keep Your Body Hydrated\nDrink a minimum of half a liter of warm water first thing in the morning before brushing your teeth, a glass an hour after dinner, and another glass before going to bed. Rest of the day, \"eat\" your water by consuming fresh fruits and vegetables rich in water content.\nThe first six of my Daily Dozen recommendations for diet and lifestyle include:\nNo other restrictions are there. Enjoy a variety of foods, including those you like and some you may not. Eat as much as you like but never beyond the point of liking. No portion control is necessary. After a year on the PBWF/IF/10K program (PBWF diet with 16:8 Intermittent Fasting and 10,000 steps daily), you should be able to rely on your body’s instincts to choose food and portion sizes.\nAnother rule of thumb is that at least half of your caloric intake should come from uncooked foods. Following these guidelines should naturally lead to this balance. Consider including sprouted beans to increase your intake of raw foods.\nHow To Cook Without Oil?\nMany Indians feel at a loss because they aren't sure how to cook vegetables without using ghee or oil. Here are a few tips:\n1. Sauté onions in a few tablespoons of water or vegetable stock.\n2. Use spices that have been dry-roasted separately.\n3. Incorporate nut butters like peanut or cashew butter.\n4. Continue with your normal cooking process.\n5. Use air fryers instead of deep frying, or opt for baking.\n6. Add avocados to dough for making rotis or stuffed parathas. Avocados contain 80% fat.\nPlease note that in my recommendations, you are permitted to use nut or seed butters (pastes). This ensures that all dishes, including Pulao and Khichri, turn out perfectly. The only exceptions are deep-fried dishes, but you can use air fryers for those.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Pillar-1 Food: Meal Plans\nMany people request daily meal plans due to confusion about what to eat. As outlined in my guidelines from last week, our diet program offers complete freedom in choosing foods, provided they are plant-based whole foods (PBWF) and consumed within a narrow daytime eating window of 8-10 hours. Starting your day with green juice, fruits, nuts, and seeds for breakfast covers three of the five essential food groups, giving you flexibility for lunch and dinner. Here are some guidelines for a daily PBWF meal plan, assuming your eating window is from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Adjustments can be made for different eating windows.\nBREAKFAST\n10:00 AM: A glass of green juice\n10:20 AM: A large bowl of fresh fruits and berries\n10:30 AM: Oatmeal or porridge made with nut milk and dates as a sweetener. Idli, Poha, Upma or similar PBWF items. This meal can also be combined with lunch, the choice is yours.\nLUNCH\n12:40 PM: A glass of green juice\n1:00 PM: Choose any PBWF dish made with grains, beans, legumes, or starchy vegetables. Examples include Daal/Roti, Daal/Rice, Khichri, Peas Pulao, Bisibhili Bhat, Idli, Dosa, Uttapam, Upma etc.\nSNACK (Optional)\n4:00 PM: Tea or coffee and/or fruits and/or dry fruits\nDINNER\n5:10 PM: A glass of green juice or  salad.\n5:30 to 6:00 PM: Any PBWF dish of your choice.\nNote: The third glass of juice can be eliminated once you are off all medications, and the second glass can also be stopped after a year of no medications. Ensure you meet your daily intake of one tablespoon of Flax/Chia seeds and a few walnuts, although those watching their weight may limit this amount. Also, take a Vitamin B-12 supplement, with any meal. Remember, there is total flexibility with the meal menu.Any grains, beans, legumes, and starchy vegetables are acceptable.\nYou can make anything out of dosa batter; it takes care of two food groups:\nDaal\nRice\nIn the long run your body will guide you, by making you feel like eating one thing or the other. After 12 months on PBWF diet, you cannot go wrong, if you listen to your body.\nIt would not be possible today,because there might be some unhealthy habits that need to be overcome first. It is a good idea to include a salad in your meal or have a salad as a meal.\nMeal Plan Suggestions\nMany people ask me as to what I eat for meals and what can be made with zero oil and zero sugar. Here is a list of foods regularly consumed at our home.\nA. 100% Compliant Selections\nSuitable for those trying to reverse chronic diseases and wean off medications:\n1. Salads with Avocado, fruits, nuts, seeds and boiled beans and  toasted croutons.\n2. Blended Vegetable Soups\n3. Rajma, Rice\n4. Chole, Aloo Chaat\n5. Dhania Aloo Chaat\n6. Imli Sonth Aloo Chaat\n7.

For example I have watched the younger hip crowds paying a lot of money for extra virgin olive oil and boasting about it. Why can’t you just have olives. Olives are healthy, olive oil is not.\nFew Additional Comments\nStop looking for vegan alternatives to foods like fake meat hamburgers etc. Please remember your goal is to avoid processed foods also. Processed, prepackaged foods are full of additive which are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) but truly aren’t.\nLearn to make various chutney’s, and keep them ready in your refrigerator. They can add taste to any otherwise bland food. Tamarind chutney (Sonth) makes any food finger licking good. I find making chaats very easy for a quick meal and chaats have zero oil.\nIt is important to note that oil free food doesn’t mean spice free.

        "content": "••• GREEN JUICING •••\nBased on my experience in various health groups, I'd like to share four key insights:\n1. Ease of Adoption:\nSome health advice is easier said than done. For example, consuming green leafy vegetables without using oil or ghee is challenging in Indian cuisine, where saag is a common preparation requiring these fats.\n2. Dietary Changes:\nIt is often hard to give up our favorite foods even when we know they are unhealthy. However, introducing tasty, healthy options can naturally displace less healthy choices.\n3. Impact of Changes:\nGradual changes often yield less noticeable improvements which can lead to a loss of confidence. Making a few dramatic changes can keep these efforts top of mind and encourage persistence.\n4.Ripple Effects:\nA single conscious change can lead to multiple subconscious improvements and accrue significant benefits. For example, starting a daily walking routine led me to naturally reject calorie-dense snacks like cookies and donuts, mindful of the effort I'd put into walking.\nWhy Green Juice?\nGreen leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which help release Nitric Oxide in the bloodstream, unclogging blood vessels and reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues.\nWhen I discussed dietary guidelines I mentioned that we need to consume a minimum 1% of our body weight in vegetables and half of that should be in green leafy vegetables. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn suggests six daily servings of green leafy vegetables for heart patients, including notable individuals like Bill Clinton. Given the culinary habits in India where salads are uncommon, I recommend juicing as a practical alternative, although it's second to consuming greens raw or blanched.\nI recommend watching the documentaries “Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead\" available on Netflix, and \"Super Juice Me\" on YouTube. These showcase dramatic health transformations through extended juice fasts. Inspired by these, I started with a five-day juice fast 11 years ago that transformed my life.\nOne should start with a 3-5 day juice fast, consuming 8-12 ounces of juice four to five times a day. After that continue with three glasses daily 15-20 minutes before meals to maximize health benefits until you can reduce or eliminate chronic medications.\nThe main goal here is to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetables (fruits should be eaten as a whole or to just make vegetable juice tastier). Juicing makes it easy.\nSelecting A Juicer\nAs green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed, especially for people who are on medications or want to lose weight.\nConsider hydraulic, double helical screw, and single augur juicers based on your budget and needs. Avoid high-speed centrifugal juicers as they can degrade nutrients and are less effective with leafy greens.\nFor patients who are critically ill, it is advisable to consume juice with minimum pulp. It is light on their stomach and for the same amount of fullness, they can consume more nutrients. (Not sure you need the last line re: cancer here since you mention critically ill above).\nDo You Lose Fiber?\nA question often asked is “aren’t you removing fiber in juicing?”\nThe answer is that there are two types of fiber- soluble and insoluble. Juicing retains soluble fiber and some of the insoluble fiber as well. One should eat fruits as a whole and juice only vegetables. You can add some fruit to enhance the taste and yes Granny Smith apples because they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables.\nThere is a saying: First thing in the morning, if you poop before you finish peeing; you are in good health. You soon will experience that.\nGreen Juice Recipe\nBefore diving into the recipe, it's important to note that there isn't a strict chemical composition required for making juice. Unlike the precise formulations often found in Ayurveda, the primary aim of juicing is to enjoy consuming green leafy vegetables in a tasty beverage, rather than enduring a bitter concoction solely for health benefits. Since everyone's taste preferences vary, feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your liking. The goal is to create a juice that's so delicious, your guests will ask for a second glass.\nConsider the recipe as consisting of three main groups of vegetables, along with some seeds:\n1. Apples and Spice Group: This includes four Granny Smith apples (or any other suitable juicing apples), two lemons, and two thumb-sized pieces of ginger.\n2. Hydration Group: Comprising one bunch of celery, one large English cucumber (or two medium regular cucumbers), and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the juice's water content, and you can easily double these ingredients if desired.\n3.Leafy Greens Group: Choose any combination of one to three of the following: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beetroot greens, cabbage, etc. (2-3 bunches total). Alternatively, for a variation, replace this group with carrots and beetroots.\nEnhance your juice by adding some flax seeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds. These seeds not only fulfill part of your Omega-3 needs but also provide fats that aid in nutrient absorption. Don't hesitate to include other non-starchy vegetables like bottle gourd, butter melon, raw turmeric, and mint. There are no restrictions—let your taste buds guide you!\nHere is a typical green juice mixture in my kitchen. See in the picture from left to right:\nChard, Kale, Arugula, Bottle Gourd, Romaine lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Beetroot, Raw Turmeric root, Green apple, Carrot and Fenel.\nShelf Life\nJuice can be stored safely in airtight glass bottles in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours or frozen for longer storage, leaving space for expansion.\nOrganic vs Nonorganic\nAlways thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables. Seek organic sources if possible, but don't avoid conventional produce out of fear of pesticides; the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh the potential risks.\nI recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market near you. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will remember you and always tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided.\nJUICE vs SMOOTHY\nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions and there clearly is big confusion on this subject, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this. Before proceeding I want to make it clear that eating leafy greens raw as salad or blanched is the best option. The chewing action in the mouth mixed with saliva provides the most nutrition and absorption. Fruits ofcourse shoul always be eaten as whole fruits except some green apples (Granny Smith variety in US as they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables) which should be added to green juice. So the question is only, what is the second best option.\n1. Smoothies require high speed blending, this makes the air oxidize the nutrients. So you have some nutrient loss due to oxidization.\n2. Because you have to mix a cup of water to start the process and because the pulp is retained, there are only half as many nutrients in a glass of smoothie as opposed to a glass of juice.\n3. Because of air and insoluble fiber you can not consume much smoothie and make up for reduced nutrients by drinking more. On the contrary the juice feels less filling than smoothie.\n4. A good juicer retains most of the soluble fiber in juice. Some of the insoluble fiber is also retained in small particles that go through the screen. The remaining insoluble fiber which is rejected, has little nutrient left. It is also not needed for bowl movement because one gets more than enough from juice.\n5. Juice does not stay in stomach much and passes through to small intestine quickly. Smoothies need to be digested and remain much longer in the stomach. Smoothies are not a good choice for juice fasts.\n6. Juice has a much longer refrigeration shelf life. You can juice only twice a week and store it in airtight glass bottles. It can also be frozen so one can reduce juice making to even once a week.\nThis post clarifies green juicing, its benefits, and its practical implementation, aiming to promote better health practices and dietary adjustments.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "• HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD YOU REALLY DRINK?\nSocial media is awash with adviceeon water consumption—recommending specific amounts to drink daily, detailing when and how to drink it, and even touting it as a cure for numerous ailments. My aim with this blog is to address these topics and clarify the confusion created by such claims.\nThe renowned Mayo Clinic suggests a daily water intake of 2.7 liters for women and 3.7 liters for men. While it's true that dehydration can lead to health issues, many of the claims about water curing illnesses are exaggerated and lack evidence. I recently spoke with a cancer patient who had increased his water intake to 3 liters per day in hopes of healing. While this hope is not harmful as long as he continues with necessary treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and avoiding angiogenic foods, it's important to set realistic expectations.\nWater is crucial for maintaining various balances within the body, such as pH and mineral levels. Consider a New Yorker who subsists on a diet rich in meat, potatoes, coffee, and alcohol, with little to no water consumption; they might experience health issues that could be somewhat alleviated by drinking more water. However, this doesn't imply that increasing water intake can cure all individuals suffering from similar ailments. This is a common misconception promoted by many online videos and claims.\nBy understanding the true benefits and limitations of water consumption, we can approach our health more effectively and avoid falling for unfounded claims.\nBenefits of Drinking Water\n- Improves blood volume and viscosity\n- Boosts your energy level\n- Flushes out toxins and keeps your organs healthier\n- Improves skin\n- Promotes weight loss\n- Enhances muscle contraction\n- Improves hormone production\n- Reduces joint pain\n- Reduces stress hormones\nThe amount of water you need depends on several factors including your health, activity level, climate, and importantly, your diet—a factor often overlooked in mainstream media.\nWater aids in maintaining both alkalinity and sodium levels, suggesting that a diet high in alkaline foods and low in sodium (typically unprocessed) may reduce the need for excessive water to eliminate acidity or salt.\nIn a climate with temperatures ranging from 15-25 degrees Celsius and dry air (such as an air-conditioned environment), and assuming an activity level of 10,000 steps per day, a useful guideline is to drink 3-5% of your body weight in water. For instance, a person weighing 75 kilograms should consume 2.25-3.75 liters of water daily, equivalent to 9-15 glasses, assuming each glass holds 250 ml. If you're consuming 1% of your body weight in fresh fruits and 1% in vegetables daily (which are about 85% water), this accounts for approximately 1.7% of the 3-5% hydration needs. Thus, the remaining requirement is reduced to 1.3-3.3%, or 4-10 glasses of water daily.\nFor those avoiding non-vegetarian and processed foods, I suggest that 6 glasses per day may suffice. Consider drinking two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, one glass an hour after each meal, and one glass before going to bed. In hotter climates, like in India, it's advisable to drink a glass of water every time you come back from an outdoor trip. However, it's possible to drink too much water, which can lead to a loss of mineral balance. A practical way to assess your hydration level is by checking the color of your urine, which should ideally be at level 2 on a scale from 1 (clear) to 5 (dark yellow).\nNote that acidic beverages and some types of acidic bottled water do not contribute to your total daily water intake.\nWater with Meals or Not ?\nIs it beneficial to drink water with meals? Opinions vary. Some sources recommend drinking warm or room-temperature water during meals to aid digestion, similar to the custom of drinking lukewarm green tea in Chinese and Japanese cultures. Others suggest waiting 45 minutes to an hour after eating before drinking water, claiming that it dilutes stomach acids and impairs digestion—though this lacks substantial scientific backing. The Mayo Clinic states that drinking water does not interfere with digestion.\nAn often overlooked factor in this debate is the type of food being consumed. For meals consisting of solid foods with low moisture content, drinking water or tea is advisable to aid in digestion. Many baked goods, such as bagels, muffins, cookies, or sweet potatoes, are difficult to swallow without the aid of a liquid. Similarly, most baked animal foods, unlike moisture-rich Indian curries, are low in moisture and may require water with meals.\nFor those adhering to a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, which includes a substantial amount of fruits and vegetables and retains water and gravy in cooked items, there is less need to drink water during meals. However, I recommend taking one sip of water before starting to eat and a couple of sips at the end of the meal to aid in the functioning of the esophageal sphincter muscles and to facilitate oral hygiene. This aligns with the Hindu practice of taking a little water in your palm and circling it around your plate and swallowing it as a prayer before eating, and rinsing the mouth after meals. If it's not always feasible to spit the water out, swallowing it is perfectly acceptable, as it contains only the consumed food.\nWater can be consumed during the meal if necessary, but it is advisable to drink it before starting and waiting about 45 minutes to an hour after finishing the meal.\nTulsi, Moringa or What?\nA common question I encounter is about the practice of consuming various substances with morning water or on an empty stomach. It's crucial to understand that every plant food offers some benefits, but it's misleading to consider them in isolation. In India, it's widespread practice to add certain items as \"superfoods,\" to your morning water.\nMost plant foods contain vitamins and minerals, their presence alone, as highlighted on social media, does not necessarily make them superior. Additionally, there's a practical issue with the advice to consume something on an empty stomach: how do you decide which should go first?\nOnce you have consumed one item, your stomach isn’t empty any more.\nI'm not opposed to consuming these items, but I advise treating them as part of your regular diet, not as supplements, and especially not outside your normal eating window. Believing they can compensate for deficiencies in your diet or lifestyle is a mistake. Here are some examples I often see: Lemon, Apple cider vinegar, Tulsi, Methi seeds, Moringa, Jeera, Ginger, Garlic, Aamla, Turmeric, Cinnamon, Curry leaves. The list goes on and on.\nMy recommendation is to incorporate these into your recipes rather than consuming them as supplements, whether first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Consume them during your designated eating times, not during fasting periods.\nTea, Coffee or Chocolate ?\nOn the topic of tea, it's interesting to note that the British introduced tea to India around 180 years ago during their trade conflicts with China. While tea does contain some nutrients, the benefits are often offset when milk and sugar are added. A healthier alternative would be herbal teas, such as hibiscus, ginger, lemon, or cinnamon, which provide more nutrients without the need for additives like milk and sugar.\nCoffee, similarly, is not native to India. It was first introduced to the Karnataka hills in the 1670s. The issue with beverages like tea, coffee, and chocolate lies in the caffeine content, which is addictive—similar to other substances like tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, and opium. Addiction can dominate your life, dictating your actions and even basic functions like using the bathroom. Skipping your usual dose can lead to headaches and a general inability to function. Thus, I recommend trying to break free from this dependency. Some people may succeed in quitting cold turkey while others might prefer a gradual approach.\nFrom a health perspective, all three beverages contain nutrients that are beneficial, but not when consumed in the typical way with added milk and sugar, which offset these benefits. If you choose to consume them, it's best to do so without these additions and in moderation. Consider starting by eliminating milk and sugar from your beverages. Opt for black tea with lemon or cardamom, or try Kashmiri Kahwa, which contains neither sugar nor milk. Green tea is another excellent option.\nYou might also notice that biscuits or donuts often accompany tea or coffee with milk. Eliminating milk from your tea or coffee can make it easier to stop consuming these snacks as well. I personally quit drinking tea ten years ago. For first few years I missed the routine of having a cup of hot beverage in the morning now even the idea doesn’t cross my mind.

        "content": "• GLUTEN, SOY & SALT•\nIs Gluten it Unhealthy?\nThe belief that gluten is unhealthy has been debunked by numerous plant-based whole food (PBWF) doctors. This myth, along with\nthe misconception that carbohydrates are detrimental to health and contribute to diabetes, has persisted in various forms for decades. The media, including bestsellers like *Wheat Belly* and *Grain Brain*, and articles in Indian media predicting the obsolescence of chapatis, have fueled this narrative. However, one might wonder why wheat, a staple for over 10,000 years, has suddenly been deemed unhealthy.\nCeliac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects fewer than one in a thousand people annually. Those diagnosed with this condition should avoid gluten, but for most, gluten poses no health risk.\nIt's true that most wheat grown in America has been significantly modified, resulting in a higher gluten content, which may cause sensitivity in some people. However, many who experience issues with American wheat report no problems when consuming wheat in Europe or India.\nThe issues often attributed to gluten are more closely related to industrial farming practices. For example, combine harvesters used on these farms cannot process green, unripe wheat, so fields are sprayed with a chemical called Roundup to dry the crops uniformly. Roundup, commonly used for weed control, has been linked to several health issues, including cancer, and has led to numerous lawsuits. The company has lost several lawsuits and many are pending in higher courts.\nMany who believe they are sensitive to gluten are likely experiencing the Nocebo effect rather than an actual reaction to gluten. This was supported by a recent international, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published on PubMed (ID# 38340757) titled “The effect of expectancy versus actual gluten intake on gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms in non-celiac gluten sensitivity.” The study concluded that symptoms were influenced more by the expectation of gluten intake rather than by gluten itself.\nFurthermore, the low-carb movement (including the Atkins Diet and books like *Wheat Belly* and *Grain Brain*) often spreads confusion and misinformation. These diets, heavily promoted by the meat, poultry, and dairy industries, advocate for high-protein, low-carb eating, aligning with interests in the animal food industry, which is inherently low in carbohydrates.\nSuch diets are not only misleading but potentially harmful in the long run. For instance, Dr. Atkins, who launched the low-carb trend with his book in the 1970s, reportedly suffered from several health issues related to his diet and weighed over 300 pounds at his death.\nSoy or Not?\nA common question relates to consuming soy products. The market offers a variety of soy products such as edamame, soybeans, soy sauce, soy milk, tofu, tempeh, soy nuggets, soybean oil, and soy protein powder. Of these, soybean oil and soy protein powder should be avoided, while others can be consumed in moderation.\nSoy Milk\nMaking vegan milk at home is a good option. While store-bought vegan milk might contain preservatives, it's still preferable to dairy. Everyone has different tastes, and it's important to find the type you enjoy most. For those with children who love milk, consider making two different varieties to avoid over-reliance on soy milk.\nTofu\nDue to societal biases towards protein, as previously discussed, it has become fashionable in restaurants and homes serving vegetarian food to include paneer, tofu, and soy nuggets. There's a prevailing belief that vegetarian meals must include additional protein-rich foods like paneer or soy; otherwise, the meal is considered incomplete. At Indian parties, for instance, you'll commonly find dishes like Paneer Tikka, Saag Paneer, Mutter Paneer, and Malai Kofta. I've attended Indian parties where the only vegan options were daal, which typically includes ghee tadka.\nThe situation with tofu is similar in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean restaurants, where vegetarian or vegan dishes predominantly feature tofu, driven by the misconception that a vegan meal without tofu is incomplete—even master chefs share this myth.\nSoy was not traditionally part of the Indian diet, which favored daal, rajma, and chole. Soy was introduced to India in the late 1960s. Globally, most soy is used as animal feed or for biodiesel. In the United States 70% is used for animal feed and 5% for biodiesel, with all soy produced being genetically modified (GMO). Scientifically, soy is controversial, but the consensus is that it's harmless in small amounts. There is nothing wrong with eating tofu in moderation—only consume it if you enjoy it, not because it's considered a health food. Personally, I prefer edamame (fresh soybeans); they make a great appetizer.\nHow Much Salt?\nThere is considerable confusion regarding the role of salt in maintaining good health, fueled by conflicting studies. However, beneath the surface, there appears to be some consensus. The views of Dr. John McDougall, one of my mentors, help to clarify this issue:\n\"Many doctors conveniently scapegoat salt, attributing numerous chronic problems to the consumption of excessive salt.\"\nHistorically, salt has been a crucial part of our diet. Slaves were often traded for salt. The word \"salary\" also originated from the term for salt, leading to the idiom \"not worth his salt.\"\nSalt consumption varies widely around the world - from less than 200 mg daily among the Yanomamo Indians in the Amazon Basin of Brazil to 27,000 mg among farmers in Northern Japan. The average American consumes about 3,500 mg of salt a day.\nPeople who adhere to a natural, plant-based, whole food diet generally maintain their health regardless of salt intake. Research indicates that these individuals, when relocated to urban environments and subjected to a modern Western diet, develop hypertension and other chronic diseases.\nThe human tongue is naturally inclined to seek out sugar and salt, with these taste buds located at the very tip of the tongue. Fortunately, the human body has a natural ability to regulate salt through the intestines—which can increase or decrease sodium absorption—and through the kidneys, which adjust the amount of salt lost in urine and sweat.\nRecent large-scale studies from the past decade have found a low correlation between salt intake and cardiovascular disease, and there might even be an inverse correlation. Among individuals with hypertension, reducing salt intake as a means to lower blood pressure may actually be associated with higher rates of cardiovascular diseases.\nSo, what is the real issue?\nThe problem lies in the company that salt keeps. Processed foods such as bacon, ham, salami, chips, fries, pizza, bagels, cheese, ice cream and Haldiram’s namkeen (in India), are the true culprits. In the US, 75% of dietary salt comes from processed foods.\nIt is nearly impossible to maintain a low-salt diet if you consume a standard diet based on animal products. Meat does not taste good without salt, and most poultry sold has been injected with saline water. Try eating salt-free cheese or boiled lamb, pork, or chicken—it's difficult to swallow. Animal-based foods are so bland that they require significant amounts of salt to be palatable.\nWhen you eat fruits, vegetables, beans, rice, nuts and seeds, minimal salt is needed to enhance the flavor of the food. This is the secret: We should avoid processed and refined foods and stop worrying about salt. Keeping a salt shaker on your dining table won’t hurt.\nIn conclusion, it's important to be critical of dietary trends that seem too aligned with commercial interests or that promise quick fixes. As the saying goes, \"We love to read good things about our bad habits.\" I urge everyone to approach such claims with skepticism and to prioritize well-rounded, plant-based-whole-food nutrition.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•• White Rice vs Other ••\nA question often asked of me is what is the best rice to eat or is white rice okay or should one change over to brown rice.\nIf you are willing to try nonwhite rice than following rice are very good choices listed in order of declining nutrition value.\n1. Wild rice\n2. Black rice\n3. Purple rice\n4. Red rice\n5. Brown rice\n6. White rice\nBrown rice has slightly more fiber than white rice. In one cup of brown rice you have 3.2 gram fiber instead of 1.7 gram in white rice. If you are consuming Standard American Diet (SAD), you hardly have any fiber in your diet so replacing one cup of rice from whit to brown may increase you fiber consumption by as much as 20-30 percent which is a significant improvement. In PBWF diet you daily fiber consumption is very high and replacing while rice with brown rice makes a negligible difference. So my recommendation is to eat which ever rice you like or your recipe calls for.\nOne problem with brown rice is that it has arsenic which is very harmful. So it is a trade off. The issue of arsenic in rice is dependent on the location where the rice is grown. The problem in US is worse than in other places.\nBut the point that I have tried to highlight is that just because a food is slightly processed as in white rice, it does not make it unhealthy.\nProcessed food are bad for many reasons:\n1. Unhealthy processes change the nature of the food.\n2. Many additives are added which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) but very unhealthy never the less. For example hydrogenated oils are classified as GRAS even though we l ow they are very unhealthy.\n3. Heavy extraction is done as in oils and sugars and high fructose corn syrup.\nNone of the above apply to white rice. Please watch linked videos on the subject. 👇",

        "content": "•FAT ? Yes. But no Oil•\nIn a plant-based whole food (PBWF) diet and lifestyle, the use of oil is discouraged. Instead, it is recommended to consume butters made from nuts and seeds. Humans evolved over millions of years consuming natural foods, which our bodies adapted to digest and absorb efficiently. Processing and refining these foods alters their composition, forcing the body to adjust and compensate, often leading to chronic illnesses. Here are the primary reasons why oils are  unhealthy and should be avoided:\n1. Increased Triglycerides\nConsuming oil, stripped of the fiber it was embedded in, quickly raises triglyceride levels in the blood, making it more viscous. This forces the heart to pump harder, raising blood pressure (BP). High BP can damage the kidneys and capillaries in vital organs like the brain and lungs over a few hours. This higher BP is not the same thing as the one caused by atherosclerosis which leads to hypertension. This higher BP is only for a few hours while your body is trying to get rid of the triglycerides by putting them into your fat cells.\nIf you were to just have one oily meal in a week and be done with it, not much harm would be done. But if you are having three oily meals a day and snacks in between, day after day, this harm becomes chronic.\n2. Imbalance of Fatty Acids\nMost cooking oils contain high levels of omega-6 fatty acids compared to omega-3. Omega-6 is pro-inflammatory and can disrupt cardiovascular health when out of balance with omega-3, leading to cardiovascular diseases.\n3. Endothelial Dysfunction\nOils impair the function of endothelial cells—lining the blood vessels—by inhibiting their ability to release nitric oxide, which is crucial for smooth blood flow. This can increase blood pressure.\n4. Increased LDL Cholesterol\nThe body produces the amount of cholesterol it needs. Inflammatory responses from excess omega-6 require more cholesterol for healing, elevating blood levels.\n5. Insulin Resistance\nOils contribute to the accumulation of lipids in muscle cells, hindering insulin’s ability to deposit glucose, which necessitates increased insulin production by the pancreas, leading to insulin resistance—a precursor to type-2 diabetes.\n6. Oxidative Stress\nExcessive omega-6 fats can make cellular functions more reactive to oxygen causing oxidative stress.\n7. Trans Fats\nDespite the FDA banning all hydrogenated trans fats in the U.S. as of June 2018, they may still be available in other countries. Dalda in India and Crisco in US are two examples of such fats. Trans fats are extremely harmful.\n8.Artery Clogging\nSaturated fats in oils can directly block arteries, potentially causing strokes and heart attacks, especially in individuals with atherosclerosis.\n9. Gastrointestinal Damage\nOils can damage epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal tract, weakening it and leading to a “leaky gut,” which is the foundation for various autoimmune diseases.\nAs outlined, the consumption of oils not only raises the risk of cardiovascular diseases but also contributes to diabetes, cancer, strokes, asthma, arthritis, and many autoimmune diseases.\nExceptions Allowed for Oil\nBefore discussing allowances, it’s crucial to understand that lifestyle diseases develop on a continuum, beginning when a child is weaned from breast milk. One method to evaluate health is by examining five metabolic markers:\n1. Waist (abdomen) size exceeding half of one’s height.\n2. Blood pressure above 130/85.\n3. Triglycerides over 150.\n4. HDL cholesterol below 40.\n5. Fasting glucose above 100.\nIf an individual exhibits three of these conditions, they are diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome. Without any of these conditions, a person is generally considered healthy. The exceptions allowed depend on one’s age and health status, as indicated by these markers. Here are the oil/ghee allowances:\n1. Under age 30 with no chronic diseases or metabolic markers: 6 teaspoons of oil/ghee.\n2. Over age 40 with no chronic diseases or metabolic markers: 5 teaspoons of oil/ghee.\n3. No chronic diseases but one metabolic marker: 4 teaspoons of oil/ghee.\n4. No chronic diseases but two metabolic markers: 3 teaspoons of oil/ghee.\n5. Previously had chronic diseases, now reversed and off medications for at least two years: 3 teaspoons of oil/ghee.\n6. Chronic diseases recently reversed and off medications: 2 teaspoons of oil/ghee.\n7. Suffering from one or more chronic diseases: No oil/ghee allowed.\nTo maintain adequate Omega-3 intake, consume one tablespoon of flaxseed, chia seed, or hemp seeds daily.\nWeaning off oil: Practical suggestions\n1. Use freshly made nut or seed butters and coconut butter instead of oil.\n2. For those who employ cooks, instruct them to mix some water with mustard oil and ghee. Explain that this mixture, prescribed by a doctor, should be shaken well before use. This technique allows for continued recipe use while reducing total oil/ghee consumption. Start with a 50/50 mixture and gradually increase the water percentage.\n3. Calculate the total monthly oil/ghee allowance and provide only that amount at the beginning of the month, instructing that it must last until the end. Many members of my health groups have successfully implemented these strategies.\nHere is a video by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn of Cleveland Heart Clinic on the subject.\nNo Oil Not Even Olive Oil\nhttps://youtu.be/b_o4YBQPKtQ\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•WHAT ABOUT EGGS?\nA frequently asked question is about eating eggs. Many vegetarians eat eggs because they are not fertilized, meaning no harm is caused to any animal. I initially mentioned that there are various reasons for adopting a Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, one being the religious principle of Ahimsa, which promotes non-violence towards animals. Although this is not my primary reason for this group, I encourage you all to watch documentaries showing the conditions in poultry farms. After seeing them, you might reconsider eating eggs or chicken. However, in this post, I will focus solely on the health aspects.\nReasons to Avoid Eggs\n1. Inflammation:\nEggs are inflammatory, and studies suggest they can increase the risk of dying from heart disease and strokes. According to a study published in the journal “Circulation”, researchers conducted a systematic review of existing research on 27,000 participants and found that eating one egg per day substantially increases the risk of dying from heat disease.\n2. IGF-1 Hormone & Cancer:\nEgg whites are rich in IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) hormone, which promotes the growth of cancer cells. In today’s society we all have tiny cancer cells floating in our body fluids. IGF-1 hormone promotes the growth in these cells.\nThis hormone can also promote angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which can lead to tumors. Prostate and Colorectal cancers are specifically linked to eggs.\n3. Lack of Fiber:\nEggs contain no fiber, causing their nutrients to be absorbed quickly in the small intestines, leaving little for colon bacteria. This can lead to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases as bacteria consume the mucosal layers of the colon.\n4. Cholesterol:\nEggs are high in cholesterol (200mg in a medium-sized egg), raising serum cholesterol levels. Although the link between cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases is debated, it often leads to the prescription of statin drugs, which have harmful side effects. The number needed to treat (NNT) for statins is 217 for heart attacks and 313 for strokes, while the number needed to harm (NNH) is only 21, meaning one in 21 people experiences muscle loss from statins.\n5. High Saturated Fat Content:\nEggs are 60% fat, mostly saturated fat, which makes them inflammatory and contributes to insulin resistance, leading to diabetes and other diseases. According to a study, published in British Journal of Nutrition, eating one or more eggs per day can increase the risk of getting diabetes by 60%.\n6. Hygiene Concerns:\nThe conditions in which chickens are kept are often unhygienic, making eggs a risk for infectious diseases like salmonella and bird flu. Fully cooking eggs can reduce this risk, but many people consume partially cooked eggs.\nMisleading Ads by Egg Industry\nDue to their high cholesterol content, the egg industry has faced challenges in combating resistance to egg consumption. In the mid-1990s, the Federal Trade Commission took successful legal action, upheld by the Supreme Court, to stop the egg industry from making false and misleading claims about the health effects of eggs.\nA video by Dr. Michael Greger  (posted at the end of this blog) highlights how the industry  became desperate, and why they could not legally claim that eggs are healthy or even safe according to the US government.\nWhen multiple nutrients, which are often consumed together, are researched it becomes easy to achieve intended results by  structuring studies creatively.\nStudies funded by the egg industry suggested that increased cholesterol intake did not cause additional harm, leading the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to remove restrictions on eggs in 2015. However, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) took no action and still considers cholesterol levels above 199 a disease to be treated with statin drugs. This shows a disconnect within the federal government.\nThe human body produces cholesterol in the liver, and it is an important nutrient. When dietary cholesterol is low, the liver compensates by producing more. The relationship between cholesterol levels and heart attacks is complex and still highly debated in the medical community.\nA report by the Physician’s Committee for Responsible Medicine analyzed the funding and findings of various studies and concluded:\n“The percentage of industry-funded studies increased over time, from 0% in the 1950s to 60% in 2010-2019. More than 85% of the research studies, regardless of funding sources, showed that eggs have unfavorable effects on blood cholesterol. But 49% of industry-funded publications reported conclusions that conflicted with actual study results, compared with 13% of non-industry-funded trials.”\nThis issue has received significant attention on social media, reflecting the ongoing controversy over egg consumption.

He highlights the impact of refined sugar on coronary heart diseases (CHD), the leading cause of death worldwide. Dr. Lustig's YouTube video \"Sugar: The Bitter Truth,\" released in 2011, went viral with over 24 million views to date. In 2014 he collaborated with Katie Couric, a well known American journalist, to create the documentary \"Fed Up\" which I strongly recommend.\nIn 1776 when the US became an independent country, the per capita daily consumption of added sugar was only two teaspoon per day. Today it is more than 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day and that is where lies the root cause of many lifestyle diseases.\nTypes of Sugar\nFood has mainly three types of sugar: ZGlucose, Fructose and Sucrose. Sucrose is a 50/50 combination of glucose and fructose molecules. Most fruits and vegetables provide both glucose and fructose but starches provide only glucose. The Human body and brain run on glucose. Most of the glucose (about 80%) metabolizes throughout the body and passes through the liver untouched. But all of the fructose gets metabolized in the liver.\nWhen food is absorbed, it reaches the liver first. Liver is the chemical factory of the body and it decides what to do with the food. It can do one of the following:\n1.Pass on most of the glucose to the blood to be distributed throughout the body, keeping a small amount for itself to be converted into glycogen and stored.\n2.Convert fructose into glucose, if the glucose level in the blood is low.\n3.Convert fructose into fat, if the glucose level in the blood is high.\n4.Convert starch into glucose.\n5.Convert fat into glucose and/or ketone bodies if the sugar level in the blood is low.\nWhy Refined Sugar is Unhealthy?\nHere is a list of negative effects of consuming refined sugars on the human body, arranged in increasing order of complexity.\n1. Refined sugar is calorie-dense, allowing excessive calorie consumption without feeling full which leads to weight gain and obesity.\n2. Refined sugar is addictive, reducing control over eating habits, which leads to overeating and subsequent weight gain and obesity.\n3. Refined sugar provides empty calories, depriving the body of nutrients that would otherwise come with natural sugars.\n4. Refined sugar is inflammatory and contributes to atherosclerosis, the leading cause of heart attacks and strokes.\n5. Consumption of sugar can cause skin problems like pimples and acne and can cause  premature skin aging and wrinkles.\n6. Sexual Health: Refined sugar can reduce sex drive and lead to impotence (erectile dysfunction).\n7. Digestive Health: Lacking fiber, refined sugar is quickly absorbed in the small intestine, leaving nothing for colon microbes. This disrupts the gut microbiome, potentially leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\n8.Fructose in refined sugar causes ectopic fat formation in the liver (causing NAFLD), around vital organs (leading to visceral fat), and within muscle cells (Intramyocellular lipids) causing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes).\n9. Refined sugar causes glycation and formation of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) which reduce the life of organs.\n10. Refined sugar feeds cancer cells, promoting cancer growth.\n11. High blood sugar, as seen in uncontrolled diabetes, can lead to numerous problems such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, gangrene, blindness, Alzheimer's, depression, and more.\nSome of these are obvious but others require further elaboration.\n1. Glycation:\nWhen a sugar molecule binds to a fat or protein molecule, it is called glycation. When we roast food at high temperatures it turns reddish brown quickly. This process happens slowly in our bodies at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to aging. Eating refined sugar without fiber results in rapid glycation. The faster glycation occurs, the quicker\naging occurs.\n2. Oxidative Stress\nSugar molecules combined with oxygen produce energy and release oxygen elements, which lead to oxidative stress. Antioxidants in our food neutralize these elements. Glucose is stable in ring form, but fructose is less stable in its linear form and gets glycated at a much faster rate than glucose. This is why processed foods and sugary sodas with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are more harmful than natural sugar in food.\n3. Metabolism of Fructose\nWhen consumed as refined sugar, it gets absorbed quickly in the small intestine. The liver allows the glucose in sugar to pass through in the blood but it has two choices as far as fructose is concerned. It can convert fructose into either glucose or fat, depending upon the body's needs. Fast absorption of refined sugar overloads the liver, leading to the creation of ectopic fat, which spills over into various parts of the body:\n1. Some of the newly formed fat spills over in the liver itself. This causes a disease called Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).\n2. Some of the fat gets attached to vital organs making them lethargic. This is called visceral fat. This is quite toxic.\n3. Tiny particles of fat also get in between muscles cells called Intramyocellular lipids. These tend to block the insulin receptors on muscle cells causing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the main cause of Type 2 diabetes.\nRefined sugar (not natural sugar in food) is responsible for diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart diseases. Dr. Robert Lustig has demonstrated that consuming the same amount of calories in sugary soda leads to an eleven-fold increase in diabetes. He also shows that refined sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) consumption causes liver fat.\nThere are many videos by Dr. Robert Lustig  that discuss why sugar is addictive and harmful. I have attached a short 7-minute video by Dr. Robert Lustig and a British documentary that effectively communicate this message. For a deeper understanding of the technical mechanisms behind sugar's harmful effects, watch Dr. Lustig's detailed lecture. Here are the links to pertinent videos. 👇\nSugar Addiction Explained\nhttps://youtu.be/bDWN5FLgbdI\nSugar: The Bitter Truth",

        "content": "•STOMACH ISSUES ON  A PBWF DIET\nSwitching to a plant-based whole food (PBWF) diet, particularly incorporating green smoothies or juices, may lead to stomach issues. These issues often depend on your previous diet and lifestyle. For instance, if your previous diet lacked fiber, you might notice changes in your bowel movements. Here are some signs and symptoms that might indicate you're increasing your fiber intake too rapidly.\nConstipation or Diarrhea\nExcess fiber can lead to constipation or diarrhea. Fiber acts as bulk that draws water into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. If you're not hydrated enough, this can cause the GI tract to dehydrate, making stools hard and difficult to pass—common with soluble fiber. Conversely, too much insoluble fiber can cause diarrhea and loose stools. It's best to increase your fiber intake gradually to avoid these issues.\nBloating\nRapidly increasing your fiber intake can cause bloating. This is because the fiber isn’t fully digested as it moves through the GI tract, which is exacerbated when consuming smoothies due to the finely mixed air.\nConsuming too much fiber can also create uncomfortable symptoms like bloating.\nThis most often happens when you eat too much fiber too quickly because most of the fiber won’t be digested or broken down while moving through the GI tract. Bloating is also quite common when you consume smoothies as their is air mixed finely in the smoothies.\nGas Problems\nIncreasing fiber feeds the microorganisms in your colon's microbiome, leading to gas production. This is more of a social issue than a health problem, as all mammals pass gas.\nAbdominal Pain\nExcessive fiber can slow down digestion or even cause it to stop, leading to cramping along with changes in bowel movements, gas, and bloating.\nMineral Deficiencies\nFiber can bind to some nutrients, preventing their absorption. This is especially true for minerals like iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and calcium. Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin C may help counteract this effect.\nWhat To Do?\nTypically, the stomach stabilizes within a few days or weeks. If issues persist, If it persists you may be eating too much fiber, consuming it too quickly, consuming the wrong kind of fiber, or be in need of some extra vitamin C. Consider the following:\n- Identify and eliminate specific foods causing issues.\n- Gradually reduce and then slowly increase your intake of juice and other fibrous foods.\n- For constipation, increase your intake of insoluble fiber; for loose stools, switch to soluble fiber.\n- Ensure you're drinking enough water if constipated.\nSkin Issues\nLosing a significant amount of fat can sometimes lead to skin issues like pimples. These typically resolve over time. Human body can hide away some toxins in fat.,As the body burns fat for energy during ketosis, it may release stored toxins, which the skin then tries to eliminate.\nAddictions & Withdrawal Symptoms\nWhen our body and mind become accustomed to certain patterns of behavior, they resist sudden changes. Regular consumption of specific beverages and foods stimulates dopamine release, temporarily enhancing our mood. Once the effect wears off, the body returns to normal or experiences a low, creating a desire for more.\nThese foods and beverages are inherently addictive. Furthermore, every cell in our body contains a clock programmed to a set pattern of behavior.\nConsuming addictive substances at regular intervals can cause significant harm. A change in dietary habits and behavioral patterns is often resisted by the body, leading to what we refer to as withdrawal symptoms. While these are commonly recognized with substances like alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, they also apply to caffeine and certain common foods.\nCaffeine is particularly addictive and can impair the ability to perform daily activities without it. Many regular consumers of tea or coffee develop a dependence, with headaches being a common withdrawal symptom. Those who attempt intermittent fasting by delaying their morning meal until after 10:00 AM often experience this. The reason caffeine is so addictive is its integral role in our daily routines and social interactions.\nCaffeine increases the production of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which affects our attention level.\nHere are some withdrawal symptoms of caffeine and food addiction.\nOur body runs on a circadian rhythm and we now know that every cell has a circadian clock inside which learn our pattern of life and works accordingly. When this pattern is disturbed it doesn’t like it. The research has shown that it takes our body 3 weeks to develop a new habit or modify old habits.\nHeadache\nRegular caffeine consumption reduces cerebral blood flow due to the narrowing of blood vessels. Although blood flow initially increases after caffeine intake, it soon diminishes, and the expected circadian rhythm-associated boost at a specific time leads to headaches if caffeine is not consumed.\nIt happens within 1-4 hours of missing the regular dose of caffeine. It is usually most common among people who consume three or more cups of coffee/tea each day.\nConstipation\nThose accustomed to starting their day with tea or coffee may experience constipation when they stop. Both caffeine and hot water stimulate bowel movements and therefore abruptly stopping caffeine intake can cause constipation. The name bed- tea originated first this reason only.\nSubstituting with warm water in the morning or herbal teas later in the day can help, especially for those practicing intermittent fasting.\nFatigue\nCaffeine increases alertness by blocking adenosine receptors, a neurtotransmitter that induces feelings of tiredness. Without this stimulant, feelings of fatigue can occur. The habit of late afternoon cup of coffee causes slow down an hour or two after lunch.\nBrain Fog\nThe release of dopamine from consuming caffeine and other addictive foods sharpens our attention. Without regular intake, our attention span may become foggy.\nIrritability\nLow energy and headaches can lead to irritability. Techniques like deep breathing (Pranayama), stretching, or stepping outside can alleviate this symptom.\nAnxiety & Depression\nCaffeine addiction can make some individuals feel jittery and anxious, and for some, stopping caffeine can produce similar effects. Additionally, because caffeine elevates mood, its absence can lead to depression.\nNausea\nWithdrawal from caffeine can disrupt the digestive system and sometimes causing nausea.\nInsomnia\nThis comes as a surprise to many because normally we associate inability to sleep with coffee consumption. But stopping coffee habit abruptly can also cause insomnia.\nTremors\nSome individuals may experience involuntary shaking, typically of the hands, as a withdrawal symptom.\nHow to Overcome Caffeine & Food Addictions?\nFor those struggling to quit, gradually, reducing consumption over a week or substituting with healthier options like herbal teas, or green juices or fresh fruits, can be effective. Here are some suggestions.\n- Drink a small glass of green juice.\n- Enjoy herbal teas like ginger, cardamom, or cinnamon.\n- Try hibiscus tea, suitable for all-day consumption.\n- Snack on fresh fruits, cucumbers, or carrots.\n- Engage in physical activities like stretching, deep breathing, or short walks outdoors.\nFood as an Addiction\nApart from well-known addictive substances like caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, certain foods can also be highly addictive, including sugar, cheese, chocolate, potato chips, French fries, ice cream, breakfast cereals, pizzas, biscuits, and cakes. These addictions can surface during periods of fasting like Ekadashi and Navratri, highlighting our dependencies.\nOur bodies operate on a circadian rhythm, learning and adapting to our life patterns. Disturbing this rhythm is met with resistance, but research shows it takes about three weeks for the body to develop new habits or modify existing ones. Managing withdrawal symptoms during this period, or gradually introducing changes, can help ease the transition.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "- [Announcer] This program is presented by University of California Television. Like what you learn? Visit our website, or follow us on Facebook and Twitter to keep up with the latest UCTV programs. (upbeat techno music) - I'm going to tell you, tonight, a story. And this story dates back about 30 years. This story has a little bit of something for everybody. It has a little bit of biochemistry, a little bit of clinical research, a little bit of public health, a little bit of politics, a little bit of racial innuendo. The only thing it's missing is sex. (audience laughs) But, well, we can see what we can do about that, too. By the end of the story I hope I will have debunked the last 30 years of nutrition information in America. And I would very much appreciate it if at the end of the talk, you would tell me whether or not I was successful or not. Okay? So, in order to get you in the mood, as it were, let's start with a little quiz. What do the Atkins Diet and the Japanese Diet have in common? Anybody? Hm? Oh, you have the answers right, never mind. That's right, you have the answer right there. So the Atkins diet, of course, is all fat no carb. The Japanese diet's all carb, not fat. They both work, right? So what do they share in common? They both eliminate the sugar, fructose. So, with that, think about what it means to be on a diet, and what macro-nutrients you're eating and which ones your not. And then we'll go from there, and I'll try to explain how this all works. So, you've all heard about the obesity epidemic. Here are the numbers. These are the NHANES database Body Mass Index. Everybody knows what that is now. Histograms marching ever rightward as time has gone on. This was what was projected for 2008 in blue. We had so far exceeded and surpassed, this is not even funny. This was from 2003. The reason I show this is not just to show that the obese are getting obeser, of course, that's true, but in fact the entire curve has shifted. We all weigh 25 pounds more today than we did 25 years ago, all of us. Now, it is often said that obesity is the ultimate interaction between genetics and environment. And Doctor Christian Vaisse, who's sitting in the back of the room, will be talking to you next week about the genetic component, which I am also very interested in. But, having said that, our genetic pool did not change in the last 30 years, but, boy oh boy, has our environment sure changed. So, tonight, we're gonna talk about the environment rather than genes. Now, in order to talk about the environment, we need to talk about what is obesity. And, of course, you're all familiar with the basic concept with the first law of thermodynamics, which states that the total energy inside a closed system remains constant. Now, in human terms, the standard interpretation of this law is the following. If you eat it, you better burn it, or you're gonna store it. Now, who here believes that? Oh, come on, you all do. (audience laughs) I used to believe that. I don't anymore. I think that's a mistake. I think that is the biggest mistake. And that is the phenomenon I'm going to try to debunk over the course over the next hour. Because I think there's another way to state the law which is much more relevant, and much more to the point. Before I get there, of course, if you believe that, these are the two problems, calories in, calories out. Two behaviors, gluttony and sloth. After all, you see anybody on the street, \"Oh, he's a gluttonous sloth, that's all there is to it.\" Tommy Thompson said it on the TV show. \"We just eat too damn much.\" Well, you know, if that were the case, how did the Japanese do this? Why are they doing bariatric surgery on children at Tokyo Children's Hospital today? Why are the Chinese, why are the Koreans, why are the Australians? I mean, all these countries who've adopted our diet all suffer now from the same problem. And we're gonna get even further in a minute. There's another way to state this first law. And that is, if you're gonna store it, that is biochemical forces that drive energy storage, and we'll talk about what they are in a few minutes, and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for normal quality of life. Because energy expenditure and quality of life are the same thing. Things that make your energy expenditure go up, make you feel good. Like ephedrine, it's off the market, coffee for two yours, then you need another hit, like me. Things that make your energy expenditure go down, like starvation, hypothyroidism, make you feel lousy. And how many calories you burn and how good you feel are synonymous. So, if you're gonna store it, that is an obligate weight gain set up by a biochemical process, and you expect to burn it, that is normal energy expenditure for normal quality of life, then you're gonna have to eat it. And now, all of the sudden, these two behaviors, the gluttony and the sloth, are actually secondary to a biochemical process, which is primary. And it's a different way to think about the process. And it also alleviates the obese person from being the perpetrator, but rather the victim. Which is how obese people really feel. 'Cause no one chooses to be obese. Certainly, no child chooses to be obese. Oh, you say, \"Oh, yeah, sure, \"I know some adults who don't care.\" You know, Rossini, the famous composer, you know La gazza ladra, Figaro, and all that. He retired at age 37 to a lifetime of gastronomic debauchery. Maybe he chose to be obese. But the kids I take care of in obesity clinic do not choose to be obese. In fact, this is the exception that proves the rule. We have an epidemic of obese six month olds. Now, if you wanna say that it's all about diet and exercise, then you have to explain this to me. So, any hypothesis that you wanna proffer that explains the obesity epidemic, you've got to explain this one too. And this is not just in America, these six month old obese kids, but these are around the world now. So, open your minds?, and let's go and figure out what the real story is. Let's talk about calorie intake, because that's what today is about. We're gonna talk about the energy intake side of the equation. Sure enough, we are all eating more now than we did 20 year ago. Teen boys are eating 275 calories more. American adult males are eating 187 calories more per day. American adult females are eating 335 calories more per day. No question, we're all eating more. Question is why, how come? 'Cause it's all there? You know what, it was there before. We're all eating more, there's a system in our body, which you've heard about over the last couple of weeks called leptin. Everybody heard of leptin? It's this hormone that comes from your fat cell, tells your brain, \"You know what, I've had enough. \"I don't need to eat anymore. \"I'm done, and I can burn energy properly.\" Well, you know what? If you're eating 187 or 335 calories more today than you were 20 years ago, your leptin ain't working. 'Cause if it were, you wouldn't be doing it. Whether the food was there or not. So, there's something wrong with our biochemical negative feedback system that normally controls energy balance. And we have to figure out what caused it, and how to reverse it. And that's what tonight is about. But, nonetheless, there are 275 calories we have to account for. So where are they? Are they in the fat? No, they're not in the fat. Five grams, 45 calories out of the 275, nothing. In fact, it's all in the carbohydrates. 57 grams 228 calories. We're all eating more carbohydrate. Now, you all know, back int 1982, The American Heart Association, The American Medical Association, and the US Department of Agriculture admonished us to reduce our total fat consumption from 40% to 30%. Everybody remember that? That how Entenmann's fat free cakes came into being. Remember that? So what happened? We did it, we've done it. 40% down to 30%, and look what's happened to the obesity, metabolic syndrome, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, cardiovascular disease, stroke prevalence, all jacked way up, as our total fat consumption as a percent has gone down. It ain't the fat, people, it ain't the fat. So what is it? Well, it's the carbohydrate. Specifically, which carbohydrate? Well, beverage intake, right? 41% increase in soft drinks, 35% increase in fruit drinks, fruitades, whatever you wanna call them. Just remember, down here, one can of soda a day, is 150 calories. Multiply that by 365 days a year, and then divide that by the magic number of 3500 calories per pound, if you eat or drink 3500 calories more than you burn, you will gain one pound of fat. That's the first law of thermodynamics, no argument there. That's worth 15 1/2 pounds of fat per year. One soda a day is 15 1/2 pounds per year. Now, you've all heard that before. That's not news to you. The question is how come we don't respond? How come leptin doesn't work? How come we can't stay energy stable. That's what we're gonna get to. So, I call this slide, very specifically, the Coca Cola Conspiracy. Anybody here work for Coke, Pepsi? Okay, good. All right, so, this over here, 1915, the first standardized bottle of Coca Cola out of Atlanta. Anybody remember this bottle? Sure, a lot of you do. I remember this bottle, because my grandfather in Brooklyn, took me on Saturday afternoon down to the local soda shop on Avenue M and Ocean Avenue, and every Saturday afternoon I had one of these. I remember it very well. Now, if you drank one of those every day, assuming of course that the recipe hasn't changed, 'cause after all, only two people in the word know the recipe, and they're not allowed to fly on the plane at the same time. You know that, okay. Assuming the recipe hasn't changed, if you drank one of those every day for a year, 6 1/2 ounces, that would be worth eight pounds of fat per year. Now, in 1955, after World War II, when sugar became plentiful again, and wasn't being rationed, we have the appearance of the 10 ounce bottle, the first one that was found in vending machines. You probably remember that one, as well. Then in 1960, the ever ubiquitous, 12 ounce can, worth 16 pounds of fat per year. And, of course, today, this, over here is the single unit of measure, 20 ounces. Anybody know how many servings are in that bottle? - [Audience Member] 2.5. - 2.5 eight ounce servings, that's right. Anybody know, anybody gets 2.5 eight ounce servings out of that bottle? That's a single serving, right? So that would be worth 26 pounds of fat per year if you did that every day. And then, of course, over here, we have the 7/11 Big K, Thirst Buster, Big Gulp, whatever you wanna call it, 44 ounces, worth 57 pounds of fat per year. And if that wasn't bad enough, my colleague, Dr. Dan Hale, at the University of Texas San Antonio, tells me that down there they got a Texas size Big Gulp. 60 ounces of Coca Cola, a Snickers bar, and a bag of Doritos, all for 99 cents. - [Audience] Oh. - So if you did that every day for a year that would be worth 112 pounds of fat per year. So why do I call it the Coca Cola conspiracy? Well, what's in Coke? Caffeine, good, good, so what's caffeine? It's a mild stimulant, right? It's also a diuretic, right? It makes you pee free water. What else is in Coke? We'll get to the sugar in a minute, what else? Salt, salt. 55 milligrams of sodium per can. It's like drinking a pizza. So what happens if you take on sodium and lose free water, you get... - [Audience] Thirsty. - Thirstier, right. So, why's there so much sugar in Coke? To hide the salt. When was the last time you went to a Chinese restaurant, had sweet and sour pork? That's half soy sauce, you wouldn't eat that. Except the sugar plays a trick on your tongue, you can't even tell it's there. Everybody remember New Coke, 1985? More salt, more caffeine. They knew what they were doing. That's the smoking gun. They know, they know. All right, so, that's why it's the Coca Cola conspiracy. So, are soft drinks the cause of obesity? Well, depends on who you ask. If you ask the scientists for the National Soft Drink Association, they'll tell you there's absolutely no association between sugar consumption and obesity. If you ask my colleague, Doctor David Ludwig, remember, I'm Lustig he's Ludwig, he does what I do at Boston Children's Hospital. Some day we're gonna open up a law firm. (audience laughs) Each additional sugar sweetened drink increase over a 19 month follow up period in kids increased their BMI by this much in their odds risk ratio for obesity by 60%. That's a prospective study on soft drinks and obesity. The real deal. If you look at meta-analysis, everybody know what a meta-analysis is? It's a conglomeration of numerous studies subjected to rigorous statistical analysis. 88 cross sectional and longitudinal studies regressing soft drink consumption against energy intake, body weight, milk and calcium intake, adequate nutrition, all showing significant associations. And some of these being longitudinal, this came from Kelly Brownell's group at Yale. I should comment, a disclaimer, those studies that were funded by the beverage industry showed consistently smaller effects than those that were independent. Wonder why. Now, how 'bout the converse? What if you take the soft drinks away? So this was the fizzy drink study from Christ Church England James et al, British Medical Journal, where they went into schools and they took the soda machines out. Just like we did here in California. We haven't seen the data yet, but they went and did it for a year. So the prevalence of obesity in the intervention schools stayed absolutely constant, no change. Whereas the prevalence of obesity in the control schools where nothing changed continued to rise over the year. So that's pretty good. So, how 'bout type two diabetes? Are soft drinks the cause of type two diabetes? Well, this study from JAMA in 2004 looked at the relative risk ratio of all soft drinks, cola, fruit punch, and found a very statistically significant trend of sugared soft drinks, fruitades, et cetera, causing type two diabetes. And you know we've got just as big a problem with type two diabetes as we do with obesity for the same reasons. And this was a sugared sweetened beverage against risk for type two diabetes in African American women. Looking here at sugar sweetened soft drinks, just the downward arrow shows that there was a significant rise as the number of drinks went up. You can see that here. Whereas orange and grapefruit juice, interestingly, did not. So, two different studies, two different increases in type two diabetes, relative to soft drink consumption. So, what's in soft drinks? Well, in America, it's this stuff, right? High fructose corn syrup. Everybody's heard of it, right? It's been demonized something awful. So much so that the corn refiners industry has launched a mega-campaign to try to absolve high fructose corn syrup of any problems, which we'll talk about in a moment. But the bottom line is, this is something we were never exposed to before 1975. And currently we are consuming 63 pounds per person per year, every one of us, 63 pounds of high fructose corn syrup. - [Audience Member] That's America? - That's America, yes. Now, what is high fructose corn syrup? Well, you'll see in a minute. It's one glucose, one fructose, we'll talk about those at great length. One of the reasons we use high fructose corn syrup is because it's sweeter. So here's sucrose, this is cane or beet sugar, standard table sugar, you know, the white stuff, and we give that an index in sweetness of 100. So here's high fructose corn syrup, it's actually sweeter, it's about 120. So, you should be able to use less, right? Wrong, we use just as much, in fact, we use more. So, here's lab fructose over here, crystalline fructose. And they're starting to put crystalline fructose into some of the soft drinks. They're actually advertising it as a good thing. Phew. And that's got a sweetness of 173, so you should be able to cut that way back, right? They're not. Lactose, down here, milk sugar, it's not sweet at all. And glucose, I should point out over here, 74. It's not particularly sweet, and we're gonna get to that at the end, and what goes on with glucose. But anyway, there's why we use it, it's sweeter, it's also cheaper as I'll show you. So, here's high fructose corn syrup. One glucose, one fructose. Notice the glucose is a six membered ring, the fructose is a five membered ring. They are not the same. Believe me, they're not the same. That's what this whole talk is about is how their not the same. And here's sucrose, and they're just bound together by this ether linkage. We have this enzyme in our gut called sucrose, it kills that bond in two seconds flat, and you absorb it and, basically, high fructose corn syrup, sucrose, it's a non issue, it's a wash. They're the same. And they know that they're the same, the soft drink companies and the corn refiners. Because here are their missives. This comes from the Corn Refiners Association. Obesity research shows high fructose corn syrup metabolizes and impacts satiety similar to sugar. Indeed it does, I agree. Decent meetings, academic meetings around the country. Hunger and satiety profiles energy intakes following ingestion of soft drinks, bottom line, research supported by the American Beverage Institute and the Corn Refiner's Association. They are correct, there is absolutely no difference between high fructose corn syrup and sucrose. So much so that the Corn Refiner's Association, in attempt to capture market share, came out with this entire ad campaign. You probably saw it on the back page of the New York Times, it was on TV, it's everywhere. \"My hairdresser says that sugar's healthier \"than high fructose corn syrup. \"Wow, you get your hair done by a doctor?\" I didn't know I could cut hair. If you all wanna see all of them, there are a whole bunch of them. You can go to www.sweetsurprise.com and see how you're being hoodwinked. But indeed, this is true. High fructose corn syrup and sucrose are exactly the same. They're both equally bad. They're both dangerous, they're both poison. Okay, I said it, poison. My charge before the end of tonight is to demonstrate fructose is a poison, and I will do it, and you will tell me if I was successful. None the less, here's Center for the Science and Public Interest and the Corn Refiners Association. Everybody remember last year, when Gavin Newsom floated his soda tax, last February? Governor Patterson of New York has since floated one. And other people are starting to talk about it. So, why are they saying this? Well, they're saying obesity's a problem, kids are drinking soda, let's tax it. So they're talking about soda like it's empty calories. I'm here to tell you that it goes way beyond empty calories. The reason why this is a problem is because fructose is a poison, it's not about the calories. It has nothing to do with the calories. It's a poison by itself, and I'm gonna show you that. Nonetheless, I just wanna read you this paragraph here in yellow. \"We respectfully urge that the proposal \"be revised as soon as possible to reflect \"the scientific evidence that demonstrates \"no material differences in the health effects \"of high fructose corn syrup and sugar.\" I agree. Here's the important sentence. \"The real issue is that excessive consumption \"of any sugars may lead to health problems.\" I agree, that's exactly right. Not may, does, does. So, here's the secular trend in fructose consumption over the past 100 years. Before we had food processing, we used to get our fructose from fruits and vegetables, and if we did that today, we would consume about 15 grams per day of fructose. Not sugar, fructose. So sugar would be 30 grams, it'd be double. We're just talking about fructose, today. Prior to World War II, before it got rationed again, we were up to about 16 to 24, about 20 grams. So, a small increase from the beginning of the century to World War II. Then, in 1977, just as high fructose corn syrup was hitting the market, we had increased that, we had, basically, doubled up to 37 grams per day, or 8% of total caloric intake. By 1994 we were up to 55 grams of the stuff per day. Remember, if you wanna do sugar, then double the number. So, that's 10.2, so you can see that more and more of our caloric intake, a higher percentage is being accounted for by sugar every single year. So, it's not just that we're eating more. We're eating more sugar. And for adolescents today, up to almost 75 grams, 12% of total caloric intake. 25% of the adolescents today consume at least 15% of their calories from fructose alone. This is a disaster, an absolute unmitigated disaster. The fat's going down, the sugar's going up, and we're all getting sick. Now let me show you why. How'd this happen? Why'd it happen? So, this is where the politics comes in. This is the perfect storm, and it was created from three political winds that swirled around all at the same time to create this perfect storm. So, the first political wind, everything bad that ever happened in this country started with one man. (audience laughs) And it's still being felt today. So, Richard Nixon, in his paranoia back in 1972, food prices were going up and down, and up and down. I'm gonna show you that on the next slide. And he was worried that this was actually gonna cost him the election. So, he admonished his Secretary of Agriculture, Earl Rusty Butz, I love that name, to basically take food off the political table, to make food a non-issue in presidential elections. Well, the only way to do that was to make food cheap. So, he was out to find all methods to be able to decrease the price of food. Remember Nixon's war on poverty? We're suffering from it today. That's what this is. Second political wind, the advent of high fructose corn syrup. So, this was invented in 1966 at Saga Medical School in Japan, by a guy named Takasaki, who's still alive. As far as I'm concerned, this stuff is Japan's revenge for World War II, except, of course, that they're suffering from it now, themselves. Like everything, it always comes back to haunt you. And it was introduced to the American Market in 1975. So, what do you think happened to the price of sugar when this thing hit the market? Here's what happened. So, here's the US producer price index of sugar going up and down, and up and down. This is not good. Stability is at 100%, if it stays nice and stable at 100%, that's what you want if you're a politician. Up and down, here's where corn sweeteners entered the market, 1975, 1980. And you can see that since then the price of sugar has remained remarkably constant. And it did so, not just in the US, but also on the international stage. Here's the London price doing the same thing. And when you look at the difference in price between sugar and high fructose corn syrup, you can see that high fructose corn syrup's about half the price. So, in other words, it's cheap. So, high fructose corn syrup is evil. But it's not evil because it's metabolically evil. It's evil because it's economically evil. Because it's so cheap that it's found it's way into everything. It's found it's way into hamburger buns, pretzels, barbecue sauce, and ketchup, almost everything. Somebody emailed me the other day and told me they went into their local grocery store and went through every single loaf of bread on the shelf, and out of 32 types of bread on the shelf, only one of them did not have high fructose corn syrup in it. So, we are being poisoned by this stuff, and it's been added surreptitiously to all of our food, every processed food. The question is why? Well, you'll see why in a minute. So, the corn refiners like to point out, \"Well, you know, it's just been a substitution. \"As the high fructose corn syrup's gone up, :the sugar's gone down. \"You know, we're just replacing, like gram for gram.\" Well, not exactly, because here's 73 pounds of sugar per year. This is from the Economic Research Service of the US Department of Agriculture. So disappearance data. 73 pounds, up to 95 pounds by 2000. And there's something missing from this slide. Anybody wanna tell me what it is? What's missing? Juice, juice is missing. 'Cause juice is sucrose, right, sugar. And juice causes obesity. So this is a study done by Myles Faith, a prospective study in inner city Harlem toddlers. And the number of juice servings per day predicts the change in BMI score per month in these inner city Harlem toddlers. Now, where do these inner city Harlem toddlers get their juice? From what, from where, from whom? From WIC. Anybody heard of WIC? You know what WIC is? Women Infants Children, right? A government entitlement program set up under who? Nixon, to prevent failure to thrive. They did. This is the equal and opposite reaction. So, let's add juice in, here it is. So, most fructose items when you put it together, now we're up to 113 pounds on this graph, and I just heard from Brian Williams, of NBC News, after the most recent study came out, that was in the Journal of Clinical Investigation, that we are actually up to 141 pounds of sugar per year. Each of us. That's what we're up to. 141 pounds of sugar per year. Now, do you think that this might have some detrimental effects on you? Hasn't stopped you, has it? That's the point, it hasn't stopped you. That's why we need to talk about this. So, juice consumption increases the risk for Type 2 diabetes. So this is the relative risk ratio as juice intake goes up, and this is in the Nurse's Study. Showing again, juice consumption, sucrose, obesity, diabetes. Okay, the third political storm, that's swirling around to create this disaster, this mega-typhoon, that thing that happened in 1982, the USDA, the American Hearth Association, the American Medical Association, all telling us we had to reduce our consumption of fat. Now, why did they tell us that? To stop what? To stop hear disease. Did we? No, we didn't, did we? In fact, it's worked the exact opposite. We've only created more. So, now how did this come to be? Why did they tell us to stop eating fat? Well, in the early 1970s we discovered something in our blood called LDL, low-density lipoproteins. You've heard of that, right? Is it good or bad? - [Audience Member] Bad. - Not so bad, we'll talk about it. In the mid 1970s we learned that dietary fat raised your LDL. So, if dietary fat is A, and LDL is B, we learned that A lead to B. Dietary fat definitely increases your LDL, no argument, it's true. And then, finally, in the late 1970s we learned that LDL correlated with cardiovascular disease. So let's call cardiovascular disease C. So we learned that B lead to C. So, the thought process by some very smart nutritionists, et cetera, the USDA et cetera, said, \"Well if A leads to B, and B leads to C \"then A must lead to C, therefore, no A, no C.\" This was the logic. Now, any logicians in the room? Anybody see any problems with that logic? Go ahead. (speaking away from microphone) - That's right, the premise is incorrect. And I'll tell you why the premise is incorrect. Because this suggests that this is all transitive. But, in fact, only the contrapositive is transitive. So, it's not no A, no C, it's no C, no A. So, the logic isn't even right. There's faulty logic here. So, this doesn't work on any level. So, I'm gonna show you why this doesn't work. But, before I how you why it doesn't work, I'm gonna show you that this was a battle royal back in the 1970s. This was not a simple thing. There were people lined up on both sides of this story. So, this, over here, is a book, 1972 it came out, and it was called Pure White and Deadly. It's all about sugar. Written by a British physiologist, nutritionist, endocrinologist, by the name of John Yudkin. Now, I never knew John Yudkin he's passed away. But, I read this book about a year ago. And without even knowing it, I was a Yudkin acolyte. I was a Yudkin disciple. Every single thing that this man said in 1972 is the God's honest truth. And if you wanna read a true prophecy, you find this book. It's not easy to find, but you go find this book. And I'm telling you, every single thing this guy said has come to pass. It's astounding, I am in awe of this guy. But on the other side we had this guy over here. His name was Ancel Keys. Anybody heard of him? So, Ancel Keys was a Minnesota epidemiologist, very interested in the cause of cardiovascular disease. And he performed the first multivariate regression analysis without computers. Now, anybody know what that means? Multivariate regression analysis? So, this is where you take a whole lot of data, and normally you would just run a few computer programs, but basically, the object is to try to figure out what causes what, and to try to factor out other things and determine what the contribution of various things all at once are to an outcome that you're looking for. So, he was interested in cardiovascular disease. So, what he did was he did this study, along with other people around the world, called the Seven Countries Study. Very famous, front page of Time Magazine in 1980. So, here's the data on the Seven Country Study. So, we have the US, Canada, Australia, England and Wales, Italy, Japan. And here's percent calories from fat on the x axis, and here we have coronary disease death rate on the y axis. And so you'd say, \"Oh, look at that.\" I mean, it's very obvious, isn't it. Sure, percent calories from fat correlates very nicely with coronary disease, right? Except for one little problem. Anybody see it? Japan and Italy? So, how much sugar do they eat? Didn't I tell you the Japanese diet eliminates fructose? They never even had it 'til we brought it to them after World War II. Italy, aside from gelato, I mean what else they got? They got a lot of pasta, there's a lot of glucose, but no fructose. There's no sugar in the Italian diet other than the occasional sweet, which they moderate. They're very careful about moderating, and they cost a lot. But, here we got England, Wales, Canada, Australia, US, you know, we are sugarholics, aren't we? We're also fataholics. So, in fact, the fat migrated with the sugar. So, here's, this is from Keys's own work. Page 262, if you wanna pick up the 500 page volume. And I'm just gonna read you the one paragraph that talks about this. The fact that the incidence rate of coronary heart disease was significantly correlated with the average percentage of calories from sucrose in the diet, is explained by the intercorrelation of sucrose with saturated fat. In other words, donuts. Where ever there was the fat, there was sucrose too. Because these guys here eat donuts. (audience laughs) Partial correlation analysis show that with saturated fat constant, there was no significant correlation between dietary sucrose and the incidence of coronary heart disease. Okay, when you do a multivariate linear regression analysis, you have to do it both ways. You have to do holding fat constant showing the sucrose doesn't work, and then you have to hold sucrose constant and who that fat still works. You see that anywhere? He didn't do it, he didn't do it. He didn't do the thing that you need to do to do a multivariate linear regression analysis. Now, this was done before computers. We can't check the work. He's dead, he died in 2004. So, we're left with a conundrum. Do we believe this? Do we believe this study, because we based 30 years of nutrition education, and information, and policy in this country on this study. And, as far as I'm concerned, it has a hole as big as the one in the USS Cole, all right, you got it? Everybody, am I debunking, yes, no? Let's keep going. Remember, I told you LDL may be not so bad? Well, here's why. Because there really isn't one LDL, there are two. There are two LDLs. Here's one over here, it's called pattern A or large buoyant LDL. So, everybody knows that LDL correlates with cardiovascular disease, and that's true. I'm not gonna argue that, that is true. But, it's not this one, pattern A LDL. These guys are so light, they are buoyant, they float. So, they get carried through the bloodstream, and they don't even have a chance, because they're so big and they're so buoyant, they don't even get underneath the edge of the endothelial cells in the vasculature to start the plaque formation process. But, over here we have this other guy, over here, called pattern B or small dense LDL. You see the difference? These guys are dense. These guys don't float. These guys are small, they get underneath the edge of the surface of the surface of the endothelial cells, and they start the plaque formation. And it's been shown by numerous investigators now, the dense LDL is the bad guy. Okay, now, when we measure LDL in the bloodstream, when you do a lipid profile, you measure both of them together, because it's too hard to distinguish the two. So, when you get an LDL, you're getting both LDLs. The neutral one and the bad one. Now, how can you tell whether your LDL is the neutral one or the bad one. What you do is you look at your triglycerides level in association with it, 'cause your triglycerides tell you which one it is. So here, here's pattern A over here, big large buoyant LDLs, and you'll notice that the triglycerides are low, and your HDL is high. That's what you want, you want a low triglyceride, high HDL, 'cause that's the good cholesterol. You want high good cholesterol. Over here, you have pattern B. And here you have high triglyceride, low HDL. That's the bad guy, that's the guy you don't wanna be. 'Cause you're gonna die of a heart attack. No question about it. Triglyceride to HDL ratio actually predicts cardiovascular disease way better than LDL ever did. Point is, when you measure LDL, you measure both. So, dietary fat raises your large buoyant. What do you think raises your small dense? Carbohydrate. Okay, so here's percent carbohydrate, and here's your pattern B going up. Everybody got it? So what did we do? What did we do in 1982? (speaking away from microphone) What did we do? We went on a high carb diet, which was supposed to be a low fat diet, right? So, here's the low fat craze. Took America and the world by storm. Because the content of low fat home cooked food, that you cook by yourself, in your house, you can control the content of fat. But when you process it, low fat processed food, it tastes like cardboard. It tastes like (bleep). So the food companies knew that, so what'd they do? They had to make it palatable? So, how do you make something palatable that has no fat in it? You add the, sugar. So, everybody remember Snackwells? Two grams of fat down, 13 grams of carbohydrate up, four of them being sugar, so that it was palatable. Well, we've just shown you that that's the worst thing you could do. And that's what we've done. And we're still doing it, today. So when you find a mistake, what do you do? You admit the mistake and you right the ship. We haven't admitted the mistake, and we haven't righted the ship. So, we've our food supply adulterated, contaminated, poisoned, tainted. On purpose, and we've allowed it, and we've let it, thought the addition of fructose for palatability, especially because of the decreased fat, and also as a ostensibly browning agent, which actually has it's own issues. Because why it browns so well with the sugar in it, actually is what's going on in your arteries. Because that's causing what we call protein glycation and cross linking, which is actually contribution to atherosclerosis. So it works on your steak on the grill, it works in your arteries the same way. And removal of fiber also. Now, why did we remove fiber from our diet? We, as human beings walking the earth 50,000 years ago, used to consume 100 to 300 grams of fiber per day. We now consume 12. Why? What did we do? We took the fiber out. So, why'd we take the fiber out? It takes too long to cook, takes too long to eat, and shelf life. So, people ask me, \"What's the definition of fast food.\" Fiberless food. I dare you, other than a salad, I dare you to go to any fast food restaurant and find anything on their menu that they actually have to cook, that has more than one gram of fiber in it. 'Cause there isn't any, and that's on purpose. Because they take the fiber out, 'cause that way they can freeze it, ship it around the world, and cook it up fast, and not only is is fast cooking, but it's fast eating, which also causes it's own satiety issues. Bottom line, we have a typhoon on our hands. And then, finally, the last issue was the substitution of transfats, which are clearly a disaster, but those have been going down, because we know that those are a problem. So we've actually gotten rid of most transfats, not completely, but most. So this is it, this is what we've done over the last 30 years. Now, to the biochemistry. Now, how many of you here have taken biochemistry? About 25%. I am going to show you a lot of reactions in excruciating detail. (audience laughs) If you've studied biochemistry, you will have an anaphylactic reaction. (audience laughs) If you haven't studied biochemistry, you will fall asleep. So, what I'm gonna suggest that you all do is just let me do my thing, to show you that, at least it works, and just count the arrows. Okay? You can do that, right? Can you count the arrows, it's not like counting sheep. Okay, you can count the arrows, and just stick with me. Just let me do my thing, and let me show you why fructose is not glucose. 'Cause what the liver does to fructose is really unique, and you've gotta understand it to understand everything I've just told you. So, number one, fructose is seven times more likely than glucose to do that browning reaction. The advanced glycation end-products. The thing that happens on your grill, happens in your arteries for the same reason. You can actually see the color too, the color change too. Fructose does not suppress the hunger hormone. There's a hormone that comes form your stomach called ghrelin you've heard about, already. So, if you preload a kid with a can of soda, and then you let him loose at the fast food restaurant, do they eat more, or do they eat less? They eat more. They just took on 150 calories, yet they eat more. Reason? 'Cause fructose doesn't suppress the hunger hormone ghrelin, so they eat more. Acute fructose ingestion does not stimulate insulin, because there's no receptor for fructose, no transport for fructose on the beta cell that makes insulin, so the insulin doesn't go up. Well, if the insulin doesn't go up, then leptin doesn't go up, and if leptin doesn't go up, you're brain doesn't see that you ate something. Therefor, you eat more. And finally, I'm gonna show you liver hepatic fructose metabolism is completely different between fructose and glucose, completely different. And I'm going to show you, before the evening is out, that chronic fructose exposure alone, nothing else, causes this thing we call the metabolic syndrome. Everybody knows what the metabolic syndrome is? So, this is the conglomerate of the following different phenomena, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, lipid problems, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease. Those all cluster together, called metabolic syndrome. I'm gonna show you how fructose does every one of those. I wanna show you the difference between glucose and fructose in a way that will be glaringly apparent. So, let's consume 120 calories in glucose. Two slices of white bread. What happens to that 120 calories? You eat the 120 calories, 96 or 80% of the total will be used by all the organs in the body. 80% off the table. Why? Because every cell in the body can use glucose. Every bacteria can use glucose, every living thing on the face of the earth can use glucose, because glucose is the energy of life. That's what we were supposed to eat. 24 of those calories, or 20% will hit the liver. So let's watch what happens to those 24 calories. Here they go. So, the glucose comes in through this transporter called Glut2, out here, the glucose is gonna stimulate the pancreas to make insulin, the insulin's gonna bind to it's receptor, and it's gonna take this substrate over here called IRS-1, insulin receptor substrate 1. That's not important right now, don't worry. And it's gonna tyrosine phosphorylate it. And it's going to be tyrosine IRS-1, which is now active, that's active. And it's gonna stimulate the second messenger here called AKT. Now what AKT does is, it stimulates this guy down here. SRABP1, sterol receptor binding protein number 1. Don't worry about it. But this is the thing that, ultimately, gets fat mechanics going. So, you 'll see in a minute. So, one of the things that SRABP1 does, is it activates this enzyme here called glucokinase, which takes glucose to glucose 6 phosphate. Now, glucose 6-phosphate can't get out of the liver. The only way to get glucose 6-phosphate out of the liver is with hormones. Glucagon or epinephrine, that's the way it can get it out. So now, the glucose is fixed in the cell, but it's only 24 calories worth, so it's not a big bolus of it. Now, the glucose 6-phosphate almost all of it, is gonna end up going over here to something called glycagen. Now, glycagen is the storage form of glucose in the liver. Because glycagen's easy to fish the glucose out with glucagon and epinephrine. So, my question to you, and granted, this is a physiology question, is how much glycogen can your liver store before it gets sick? The answer's any amount. It's unlimited. We have carb loaders who run marathons, right? Does it hurt them at all? We have kids with a disease where they can't get the glucose out of the glycagen, called glycagen storage disease type 1A, or von Gierke disease. They got livers down to their knees their so big. They're hypoglycemic like all get out 'cause they can't lift the glucose out of their liver. But, they don't go into liver failure. Because glycagen is a non-toxic storage form of glucose in the liver. So, the whole goal of glucose is to replete your glycagen. So, this is good, this is not bad, this is good. Now, a little of that glucose is gonna fall down here, it's gonna get metabolized down to this stuff here, called pyruvate. And the pyruvate is gonna enter your mitochondria, over here. Remember, your mitochondria are the parts of your cell that actually burn the energy. They're your little factories. They make the stuff that lets you live. Called ATP, ATP, adenosine triphosphate, that's the energy of life, right there. So, the pyruvate comes in, gets converted to something called acetyl-CoA, gets metabolized by this thing called the Krebs cycle, TCA cycle, and you throw off ATP and carbon dioxide which you breath off. So far, so good? Have I snowed anybody yet? You're with me? I snowed one guy back there. (audience laughs) I'm doin' my best, I swear to God, I'm doing my best. Anyway, so this stuff over here, this acetyl-CoA, gets burned off in the TCA cycle. Maybe you won't burn all of it off, and so, some of it may exit as citrate. And the citrate then leaves the mitochondria through a process known as the citrate shuttle. And then that citrate can then be broken down by these three enzymes, which are all subservient into this SRABP1. This is ATP citrate lyase acetyl-CoA carboxylase fatty acid synthase. They're not important. The only thing to know is these three enzymes together turn sugar into fat. This is called denovo, meaning new, lipogenesis, fat making. This is denovo lipogenesis. So you take the citrate which came form the glucose, and you end up with something called acetyl-CoA, which then gets packaged with this protein here, and you end up with something called VLDL, very low density lipoprotein. Now, anybody heard of that before? Is it good or bad? It's bad, that's bad. VLDL is bad because that's one of the things that causes heart disease. It's also a substrate for obesity. So, you don't wanna make much of this. But the point is, you started with 24 calories, maybe a half a calorie will end up as VLDL. So, that little Japanese guy with the little hat, you know, working out in the field, eating rice for the next 90 years, can he die of a heart attack at age 90? Sure. But that's not so bad. If you make it to 90, you're doing alright. Because that VLDL coming from glucose. Glucose made a little bitty VLDL. And that serves as a substrate for adipose deposition into your fat cell, here triglyceride. In addition, because of the insulin went up in response to the glucose, your brain sees that signal. And it knows that that is supposed to shut off further eating. In other words, hey, I'm busy metabolizing my breakfast. I don't need lunch. And so, you have a nice negative feedback loop between glucose consumption, the liver, the pancreas, and the brain, to keep you in normal negative, yin yang energy balance. This is good, this is not dangerous. This is what's supposed to happen. So now, let's talk about a different carbohydrate. Let's talk about my favorite carbohydrate, maybe yours too. (crowd murmuring) Ethanol. Ethanol is a carbohydrate, isn't it? Here's the structure, carbon hydrogen oxygen, it' a carbohydrate. But, we all know that ethanol is a toxin, right? A poison, right. You can wrap your Lamborghini around a tree, or you can fry your liver, your choice. Depends on how much you drink and how often. Right? Okay. So, we know that ethanol is not good for you, except, of course, a little bit is good for you. So, we can talk about that too, later, if you want. But, let's talk about how it's bad for you. So, here's acute ethanol exposure. CNS depression, vasodilatation, hypothermia, tachycardia, myocardial depression, pupillary responses, respiratory depression, diuresis, hypoglycemia, loss of fine motor control, you all went to college. (audience laughs) Here's fructose, nothing. It doesn't do any of those. Because the brain doesn't metabolize fructose. Alcohol gets metabolized in the brain, to cause all of those things, but fructose doesn't. So, fructose is not an acute toxin, ethanol is. We control ethanol, don't we? We have something called the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms. We have all sorts of things, we tax ethanol. We do all sorts of things to limit consumption of ethanol. The Nordic countries, all the liquor stores are state run in attempt to try to set the price of ethanol high enough so as to discourage consumption for public health reasons. We have 1500 years of alcohol control policy in this world to draw on, in terms of how to limit consumption. Got it? Because ethanol is a toxin, and we know it. So, let's consume 120 calories in ethanol. Shot of Makers Mark. Anybody taste it? Yeah, good, okay. So, 24 calories right off the top. The stomach and the intestine have something called the first pass effect, so 10% off the top, and kidney, muscle, brain will consume the other 10%. So there goes 20% or 24 calories right off the top. 96 calories of the 120 are gonna hit the liver. Now, how many was it for glucose? It was 24. So, four times the substrate is gonna hit the liver, and there's the rub. This is a volume issue. We're gonna show you how. So, the ethanol comes in, passive diffusion, there's not receptor for it, not transporter. First thing that happens is ethanol gets converted to this guy, over here, called acetaldehyde. Anybody know anything about aldehydes? Like formaldehyde? Right? Are aldehydes good for you or bad for you? They're bad, right? 'Cause what do they do? They can cause cancer, they cross link proteins is what they do. So, if you cross link enough proteins in your liver, what do you think happens to it? You get something called... Cirrhosis, right exactly. So this guy, over here, is bad. And it generates something called reactive oxygen species. Reactive oxygen species damage proteins in the liver. And the more alcohol you drink, the more of this stuff you get. So far, so good? So, this is one of the reasons why alcohol's bad. Now the acetaldehyde will come down here to something called acetate. The acetate will enter the mitochondria, just like the pyruvate did before. Will get converted to acetyl-CoA and participate in the TCA cycle, just like before, to generate energy. So that alcoholics don't die form lack of energy, they got energy, it's everything else they don't have. They're gonna have a whole lot of citrate. Because they have 96 calories that have to get metabolized. How many calories made it to the mitochondria with glucose? About half, right? Because most of it went to glycogen. So, we've got a big citrate, so it's in big font to show you that we're talking about big citrate now. And so, the big citrate is gonna get metabolized all the way to VLDL by the CRABP1. And so you're gonna get a lot of the LDL. And this is the dyslipodemia of alcoholism, right here. Everybody see that? So, the liver's gonna try to export this VLDL out so that it doesn't get sick, because when fat builds up in the liver, that's not good for it. Some of it's gonna exit as free fatty acids, and those free fatty acids, will take up residence in the muscle, and you get something called muscle insulin resistance. So insulin resistance, that's a bad thing. That makes your muscles and your liver now work so well. And can cause all sorts of other problems like diabetes. Some of the acetyl-CoA won't even make it out, and will precipitate as a lipid droplet, so there's your alcoholic steatohepatitis. This acetyl-CoA, and this ethanol, and these reactive oxygen species can start this enzyme activated. It's called c-jun n-terminal kinase 1, or JNK1, and it really is JNK1 because it is the bridge between metabolism and inflammation. So, when you generate JNK1, you do bad things to your liver, which I will show you when we talk about fructose. So let's talk about fructose. Fructose is sweet, we like it a lot. We like it in everything, we like it in our bread, we like it in our pretzels, we like it everywhere we look. So, let's consume 120 calories in sucrose. A glass of orange juice. Everybody got it? So, two slices of white bread, a shot of makers mark, a glass of orange juice, all the same 120 calories. But, three different substrates. Let's see what happens to the fructose. So, number one, the glucose, remember, 'cause sucrose is half glucose half fructose, so 60 of the calories of the 120 are glucose. 12 are gonna make it into the liver, 48 out here for the rest of the body. The same 20/80 split we had before with glucose. So far, so good. But all 60 calories of fructose are gonna be metabolized by the liver. Why? Because only the liver can metabolize fructose. So, what do we call it, where when you take in a compound that's foreign to your body, and only the liver can metabolize it, and in the process, generates various problems? What do we call that? We call that a... Poison. So, let me show you how it's a poison. So, let's watch the fructose. So, the fructose comes in through this transporter, now. Before it was Glut2, now it's Glut5 No insulin, remember, 'cause fructose does not stimulate insulin. Fructose, then, gets metabolized by this guy, over here, called fructokinase, to form something called fructose 1-phosphate. In the process, ATP has to give up one phosphate to ADP 'cause the phosphate had to come from somewhere, so it comes from here. Now, before we had 24 calories that had to be phosphorylated. Now we have 72 calories that have to be phosphorylated. So, we have three times the substrate, and there's the rub. It's a volume issue, for right now. So, we're gonna lose a lot of phosphate, aren't we? So there's a scavenger enzyme in your liver called AMP deaminase 1 to rescue the phosphates off the rest of the ATP molecule, and it takes ADP down to AMP, adenosine monophosphate, down to IMP, Inositol monophosphatase, and finally, to the waste product uric acid. Anybody every heard of uric acid? What is it? It's a waste product. Goes out in your urine. 'Causes what disease? Gout, right. Also causes another disease called hypertension. Let me show you how. Because uric acid, turns out, blocks the enzyme in your blood vessels called endothelial nitric oxide synthase. And that's the enzyme that makes the stuff called nitric oxide, NO. And that is your endogenous blood pressure lowerer. That keeps your blood pressure low. So, when you can't make it, your blood pressure goes up. So, this just shows that fructose consumption increases gout in adults. So, this is a study that came out last year showing that fructose consumption increases the risk for gout, showing that uric acid's going up. And this is a study done by pediatric renal fellow, Stephanie Winn, just published in Journal of Pediatrics, it's not submitted any more, it's long in press, showing that this is in the NHANES database in the adolescents, showing that sugar sweetened beverages, as it goes up, your uric acid goes up. And, not only does your uric acid go up, but here's your sugar sweetened beverages, and here's your systolic blood pressure going up. And here's a study done by Dan Fige, at the University of Texas San Antonio, where he took obese adolescents with hypertension, and he gave them the drug Allopurinol. And Allopurinol is the drug that you treat gout with, to lower the uric acid. And look what happened to the blood pressure. Systolic, diastolic, went down. Showing that, in fact, uric acid is an important part of hypertension. We have a hypertension epidemic in this country. Here it is. It's the sugar. Okay, so, so far we have high blood pressure. Let's keep going. The fructose will get metabolized down to pyruvate, the pyruvate will enter the mitochondria just like before, throwing off a lot of citrate. And here's a little trick that fructose does that glucose doesn't. 'Cause these to can reform this stuff over here called fructose 1 6 bisphosphatase, which can then reform with glyceraldehyde to form this guy, over here, called xylulose-5-phosphate. And I get to xylulose-5-phosphate in a moment. But I wanna point out this asterisk. That's there to remind me to tell you something. That's there to remind me to tell you that this is why the sports drink companies put high fructose corn syrup in the sports drinks. Because if you are glycogen depleted, in other words, if you just ran a marthon, and you have no glycogen left in your liver because you burned it all, and you take in a sports drink with high fructose corn syrup, you can replete your glycogen faster than with glucose alone. That's true. So, for elite athletes, a high fructose corn syrup containing sports drink actually makes sense. And so, indeed, sports drinks have high fructose corn syrup. The question is who drinking the sports drinks? Any elite athletes you know? Who's drinking the sports drinks? The kids, right? Why are they drinking it? Because it's cool, right? 'Cause it's cool and it tastes good. So, before we go on, I just wanna, now, digress for a moment. 1967, University of Florida patents Gatorade. Everybody remember Gatorade? Okay, 1970, the Florida Gators win the NCAA Championship in football. Gatorade makes a big splash. Okay, big deal. Anybody ever taste the original Gatorade? Yeah? What'd it taste like? Tasted horrible. It tasted like something that you might find coming out of you instead of going into you. (audience laughs) It tasted awful. 1992, Pepsi buys Gatorade, and they say, \"How are we gonna market this swill?\" So, what did they do? They added the high fructose corn syrup. So, now who drinks it? Fat kids, right? Not even skinny kids, fat kids drink it. Okay, so there's a problem here. Okay, and we're gonna show you how that works. Okay, so xylulose-5-phosphate, just to show you, if you take a rat, and you glycogen deplete him by making him run on an exercise wheel, and then you re-feed them with starch or with sucrose, the xylulose-5-phosphate goes way up with the sucrose. So you get more xylulose-5-phosphate through this pathway here, going over here. So why do we care about xylulose-5-phosphate? Well, here's why. Because it stimulates this guy, over here, called PP2A, which then activates this transcription factor here, carbohydrate response element binding protein, which then activates what three enzymes? New fat making right, the novo lipogenesis. So here's the citrate, we got lot's of that. And here we've got acetyl-CoA, which is the way into fat, which then gets packaged to the VLDL, and now you've got the dyslipidemia of obesity of fructose consumption, which has, been known for many years. So, here's normal medical students, if you can call them normal, taking in a glucose load. Notice, almost none of it ends up as fat. Taking in a fructose load, same number of calories, 30% of it ends up as fat. So when you consume fructose, you're not consuming a carbohydrate, you're consuming fat. So everybody talks about a high fat diet. Well, high sugar diet is a high fat diet. That's the point. That's exactly the point. This is a study where they gave acute administration of fructose, and you can see the triglycerides going up compared to the control. Serum triglyceride, right there. Here's normal medical students, again, six days of high fructose feeding. Triglycerides doubled, de novo lipogenesis went up five times higher, and here's free fatty acids, which then cause insulin resistance, doubled. Six days. So, here's the dyslipidemia of fructose consumption. We're not done. Some of the fat won't make it out of the liver, just like with ethanol. And now you've got a lipid droplet, so now you've got this nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. So, this is work that we did in our clinic looking at sugar sweetened beverage consumption against the liver enzyme marker ALT, alanine aminotransferase, which tells you about fatty liver. And sure enough, here's sugar sweetened beverages against ALT, and you can see a nice linear relationship in Caucasians. African Americans, it's a different relationship, and that' a' whole 'nother story all by itself. So, there's the lipid droplet of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. Some of it will come out as free fatty acids and populate the muscle, will also tell the insulin to go up higher. Remember that JNK1? So, here's what JNK1 does. So, the acetyl-CoA and the fructose can all activate JNK1. And what JNK1 does is, remember when we used glucose, this IRS became tyrosine IRS-1 and that was good? Remember that? Well, JNK1, what it does, is it's serine phosphorylated IRS-1. And serine IRS-1 is inactive. So now, the insulin can't even do it's job in the liver. So, now you have liver insulin resistance as well. That's gonna make the pancreas work that much harder generating higher insulin levels, which raise your blood pressure even further, cause further fat making, cause more energy to go into your fat cell. There's your obesity. And finally, our research has shown that the higher the insulin goes, the less well your brain can see it's leptin. And so there you've got continued consumption because your brain thinks it's starving. And it's been shown in many different ways that fructose consumption changes the way your brain recognizes energy. All in a negative fashion, so that you, basically, think you're starving. Your brain gets the signal that you're starving even though your fat cells are generating a signal that says, \"Hey, I'm full like all get out.\" So, this just shows you how it goes. So, the high insulin generates the obesity because this is that, remember the first law of thermodynamics, the biochemical force generating the energy storage as the primary phenomenon, remember, if you're gonna store it, and you expect to burn it then you're gonna have to eat it. So, here's the store it. Normally, that would make leptin, and the leptin should feed back and turn everything off, but it doesn't, because the insulin gets in the way, and the high fat diet gets in the way. Also, the hyperinsulinemia stops the leptin from acting on that nucleus accumbens, and so you get an increased reward signal. So that continues your appetite, continues more fructose, more carbohydrate, generating more insulin resistance than you can see. You generate a vicious cycle of consumption and disease, and no stopping. So, here we are, hypertension, inflammation, hepatic insulin resistance, hyperinsulinemia, dyslipidemia, muscle insulin resistance, obesity, and continued consumption. Looks like metabolic syndrome to me. So, here are the phenomena associated with chronic ethanol exposure. Hematologic disorders, electrolyte abnormalities, hypertension, cardiac dilation, cardiomyopathy, dyslipidemia, pancreatitis, malnutrition, obesity, hepatic dysfunction, that's alcoholic steatohepatitis, fetal alcohol syndrome, and addiction. Here's fructose. Eight out of twelve. Why? 'Cause they do the same thing. 'Cause they metabolize the same way. Because they are the same. They come from the same place, right. How do you make ethanol? Naturally. Right, you ferment sugar. Hasn't changed, 'cause it has all the same properties. Because it's basically taken care of by the liver in exactly the same way, and for the same reason. Because sugar and ethanol are the same, every which way you turn. So, here's our clinic intervention. This is what we do in our clinic. It's as simple as you can imagine. We write this on the back of a matchbook. It's just as simple as you can make it. We have four things we teach the kids to do, and the parents. Get rid of every sugared liquid in the house, bar none. Only water and milk, there is no such thing as a good sugar beverage, period. Eat your carbohydrate with fiber. Why? Because fiber is good. Fiber is supposed to be an essential nutrient. And we can talk later, if you want, after the cameras turn off, as to why fiber is not an essential nutrient. Because the government doesn't want it to be. 'Cause then they couldn't sell food abroad. Wait 20 minutes for second portions, to get that satiety signal. And finally, buy your screen time minute-for-minute with physical activity. That's the hardest one to do. So, if you play for half an hour, you can watch TV for half an hour. You wanna watch TV for an hour, play for an hour. That one's a hard one, but anyway. We follow our patients every three months. So, here's my question. Does it work? What do you think? Yeah, it works. So, this is BMI z-score time from initial visit. It works. But, we were interested in what made it work, and made it didn't work, so we did a multivariate linear regression analysis. The thing that made it not work, sugared beverage consumption. The more sugar beverages the patient drank at baseline, the less well lifestyle intervention worked for all the reasons I just showed you. So, why is exercise important in obesity. Because it burns calories? Come on. 20 minutes of jogging's one chocolate chip cookie. You can't do it. (audience laughs) Are you joking me? So, why is exercise important? I'll tell you why, here's why. Number one, it improves that skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity because you're insulin actually works better at your muscle, which then brings your insulin levels down. Which is good for you. Number two, it's your indigenous stress reducer. It's the single thing that actually stress reduces. And if you stress reduce, what do you think your appetite does? Goes down, because stress and obesity go hand in hand, for all sorts of reasons which are beyond the scope of this lecture today. But, we can talk about it in the question period, if you want. And then finally, remember that de novo lipogenesis? Remember those three nasty enzymes? What if you burned the stuff off before you made the fat? That's what exercise does, 'cause it makes that TCA cycle run faster, so you don't get the citrate leaving the mitochondria, so it doesn't get turned into fat, so it doesn't precipitate and cause all the problems you just saw. (speaking away from microphone) That's what they mean by a higher metabolism, yes. But it has nothing to do with burning of calories. That is the stupidest reason that I've every heard of for exercise. You gotta be joking me. You can't do it. I mean one Big Mac and you gotta mountain bike for ten hours. (audience laughs) Are you joking? So, why is fiber important in obesity? So, this is my motto in clinic. When God made the poison, he packaged it with the antidote. 'Cause fructose is a poison. I think I've, hopefully, shown you that. But, wherever there's fructose in nature, there's way more fiber. You ever see a piece of sugar cane? It's a stick, right? (audience laughs) You can't even chew the damn thing, right? You gotta suck the stuff out. (sucking) Like that, right? I mean, how many calories you think you're gonna get out of a piece of sugar cane? They actually did studies on the sugar plantations back in the early 1900s. All of the workers were healthy and lived longer than the sugar executives who got the processed product. How 'bout that, wonder why. So, eat your carbohydrate with fiber, that's why we say that. That includes sugar, that's why fruit's okay. Because number one, it limits how much fructose you're gonna take in, and number two, it gives you an essential nutrient which you needed in the first place. And you get some micronutrients along with it so that you actually, your liver works healthier. So, here's what fiber does. Number one, it reduces the rate of intestinal carbohydrate absorption. Now, sometimes that's bad. I'll tell you when that's bad. Now when that's bad? That's bad when you're at a formal function. 'Cause what happens if you reduce the rate of carbohydrate absorption in your gut? The bacteria get to it. So, as far as I'm concerned, in life you've got two choices. It's either fat or fart. (audience laughs) It increases the speed of transit of the intestinal contents to the ilium, and that raises this hormone over here called PYY, which goes to your brain and tells you the meal's over. That's your satiety signal. So when you add fiber to your diet, you actually get your satiety signal sooner, because the food moves through faster. And then, finally, it also inhibits the absorption of some free fatty acids all the way to the colon, and then those get chopped up into little itty bitty fragments called short chain fatty acids, and those actually suppress insulin, as apposed to long chain fatty acids which stimulate insulin. So there are a whole bunch of reasons why fiber is good. Anybody ever heard of the Paleolithic Diet? Go home and read up on it on the internet. The Paleolithic Diet. Basically, if you east everything as it came out of the ground raw, with no cooking, you would cure diabetes on a dime. Takes about a week. Because you're getting that 100 to 300 grams of fiber I mentioned before. That's why, 'cause fiber is good for you. And the more, the better. - [Audience Member] Type 2. Type 2, right, Type 2, not Type 1. I stand corrected, Type 2. Now, for some fun. That's the end of the biochemistry. Phew, how'd I do? (audience applauds) I told you I'd get you through it. So, now comes the fun part. The racial innuendos, and all the political stuff. The fructosification of America, and, of course, the world. Ready? Another quiz. Can you name the seven foodstuffs at McDonald's that don't have high fructose corn syrup or sucrose? - [Audience Member] Mustard? - (laughs) No, mustard has it. (audience chatter) Oh, come on, come one, the big one. French fries, but they have salt, starch, and fat. So, they're not so good either. Okay, what else? We'll get to coffee. Hash browns, for the same reason, salt starch and fat. What else, chicken McNuggets, I was shocked. I was shocked. No sucrose or high fructose corn syrup in chicken McNuggets. But, as the Circuit Court Judge in New York called them, they are still a McFrankenstein creation. (audience laughs) But, nonetheless, no sucrose, I was really shocked. Sausage. Oh, they're terrible, they're just disastrous. But, I mean, there's nothing good in them at all, but there's not fructose. Sausage, Diet Coke, Coffee, if you don't add the sugar, and ice tea, if you don't add the sugar. By the way, the chicken McNuggets, we have a disclaimer, because no one eats the chicken McNuggets without a dipping sauce. And there's a whole bunch of high fructose corn syrup in the dipping sauce, right? Okay, good, all right. So, who's really drinking this? We talked about this before. Gatorade AM. So, this is an attempt by Pepsi to capture market share on the juice market. Do you think there are any elite athletes who actually drink this stuff? You gotta be kidding me. Okay, this is for kids, right? So, this really blew my socks off. This was my daughter, when she was in second grade, two years ago, Miriam Lustig, brought these two cartons of milk home for me, and said, \"Dad, you're not gonna believe this.\" Second grade. So, here's the calories in Berkeley Farms 1% low fat milk, 130 calories, 15 of them are sugars, 'cause it's lactose, which is okay. And here's Berkeley Farms 1% chocolate milk, 190 calories, 29 grams of sugar, all high fructose corn syrup. It's like a glass of milk plus a half a glass of orange juice. And that's what we're giving to our kids. And do you know what the nutrition department at the SFUSD says? \"Well, we have to get our kids to drink milk some how.\" Is that brilliant, or what? I don't know. Now, what about WIC. So, we talked about the 112 pounds of orange juice that the kid down in Salinas was drinking. What bout WIC? Remember what we started with? We have an epidemic of obese six month olds. Remember? So, could this be the reason? So, here's a can of formula. 43.2% corn syrup solids, 10.3% sugar. It's a baby milkshake. Soda, Coca Cola, is 10.5% sucrose. Formula is 10.3% sucrose. Any difference? And there's a huge literature that's now coming of age that shows that the earlier you expose kids to sweet, the more they're gonna crave it later. Plus, there's a new literature that shows the more sugar the pregnant woman drinks or eats during the pregnancy, the more that gets across the placenta, and actually causes what we call developmental programming, changing the kids adiposity even before the kid is born, and driving this whole epidemic even further. So, we'll close in a few minutes. But, I just wanna point out what's the difference. Here, we got a can of Coke. Here we got a can of beer. And I'm not picking on Schlitz, or anything. It's any beer you want, okay. So, 150 calories each, no difference in terms of total calories. Percent carbohydrate, so 10.5% from sucrose here, except it's high fructose corn syrup, but who cares. 3.6% alcohol, here's the breakdown. 75 fructose, 75 glucose for the Coke. 90 alcohol 60 maltose for the beer. Remember, the first pass GI metabolism takes 10% of the alcohol off the table. So, when you actually compute the number of calories hitting the liver, which remember was the big difference between glucose and fructose, remember? 72 versus 24 and started the whole thing into motion as term of what happens that's bad. Bottom line, no difference. So, we have something called beer belly. Well, welcome to soda belly. 'Cause that's what America's suffering from. No ifs ands or buts. That's what it is. Now, you wouldn't think twice about not giving your kid a Budweiser. But, you don't think twice about giving your kid a can of Coke. But, they're the same, in the same dosing, for the same reason, through the same mechanism. Fructose is ethanol without the buzz. Fructose is a carbohydrate. Yes, it is. But fructose is metabolized like a fat. And I've just shown you that 30% of any ingested fructose load ends up as fat. So when people talk about high fat diets doing bad things, no, what they're really talking about is high fructose diets, and that's what Ancel Keys was looking at. So, the corollary to that is, in America at least, and around the world too, a low fat diet isn't really a low fat diet. Because the fructose or sucrose doubles as fat, it's really a high fat diet. That's why our diets don't work. And fructose, just like ethanol, for the same reason, through the same mechanism, and in the same dosing, is also as toxin. Now, last, what can we do about it? Can we do anything about it? How 'bout the FDA? You think they can do something about it. After all, aren't they supposed to regulate our food? Aren't they supposed to regulate what they can put in food? Weren't they supposed to regulate tobacco? Now they are, actually. So, you know, weird things. So, I wanna just show you what the tobacco company thinks of all this. This is actually from the UCSF Legacy Tobacco Documents Library that Stan Glantz runs right across the street. Stan's a good guy, like Stan a lot. And he showed me this. \"Under the regulations governing food additives,\" so this came from an Altria or Phillip Morris executive, \"it is required that additives be safe, \"defined as a reasonable certainty \"by competent scientists that no harm \"will result form the intended use of the additive.\" Now, does fructose meet that standard? Well, the FDA says that fructose, high fructose corn syrup, has what's knows as GRAS, G R A S status, generally regarded as safe. Now, where'd that come from? No where. It came from no where. It came from the notion that, \"Well, fructose \"is natural, it's in fruit, it must be okay.\" Well, tobacco's natural too. But it's not. Ethanol's natural, but it's not. A whole bunch of, you know, Jamaican ackee fruit's natural, but it's not either. It kills you. Keeping on going. \"A food shall be deemed to be adulterated \"if it bears or contains any poisonous \"or deleterious substance which may \"render it injurious to health.\" Fructose fits that description, right? Uh-uh, but now with the prevention of chronic diseases, even though it's own regulations explicitly postulate the connection between such products and such diseases. In other words, the FDA will only regulate acute toxins, not a chronic toxin. Fructose is a chronic toxin. Acute fructose exposure did nothing, remember. 'Cause the brain doesn't metabolize fructose. The liver does. And the liver doesn't get sick after one fructose meal. It get's sick after 1000 fructose meals. But, that's how many we eat. So, the FDA isn't touching this. The USDA isn't touching this. Because if the USDA touched this, what would that mean? That would mean an admission to the world that our food is a problem. So, what to you think that would do? There are three things in this country that we can still sell overseas. Weapons, entertainment, and food. Cars? (laughs) Computers? I don't thinks so. Can anybody think of anything else that another country wants of ours? What? Tobacco, right, tobacco. (laughs) All right, you get the picture. So, the USDA doesn't wanna know about this. 'Cause this is bad news. And so, who runs the food pyramid? The USDA. It's the fox in charge of the hen house. Because their job is to sell food. And who's eating it? We are. So, in summary, fructose, and I don't care what the vehicle is, it's irrelevant, sucrose or high fructose corn syrup, I don't care, fructose consumption's increased in the past 30 years, coinciding with the obesity epidemic. A calorie is not a calorie. And the dietitians in the country are actually perpetrating this on us. Because the more you think a calorie's a calorie, the more you think, well than if you ate less and exercise more, it would work. It doesn't. All of the studies show it doesn't work. Here's why it doesn't work, because a calorie is not a calorie. Fructose is not glucose. We know a calorie is not a calorie. 'Cause there are good fats and bad fats. There's good protein and bad protein. Okay, there's good carbohydrate and bad carbohydrate. And glucose is good carbohydrate. Glucose is the energy of life. Fructose is poison. You are not what you eat. You are what you do with what you eat. And what you do with fructose is particularly egregious and dangerous. Hepatic fructose metabolism leads to all the manifestations of the metabolic syndrome. Hypertension through that uric acid pathway, de novo lipogenesis, dyslipidemia, hepatic steatosis through that DNL pathway, those three enzymes, the new fat making pathway, inflammation through JNK1, hepatic insulin resistance because of the serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, obesity because of the VLDL transport to the adiposite, and leptin resistance promoting continuous consumption, basically starving your brain, making you think you need more. Fructose ingestion interferes with obesity intervention, as we showed in our clinic. The more soft drinks, the less well diet and exercise actually worked. Fructose is a chronic hepatotoxin for the same reason that alcohol is. The only difference is alcohol is metabolized by the brain, so you get alcohol effects. Fructose is not metabolized by the brain so you don't get those effects. But everything else it does is the same. But the FDA can't and won't regulate it. It's up to us. I'm standing here today to recruit you. That's a famous saying here in San Francisco, right? \"I'm Harvey Milk, and I'm here to recruit you.\" I'm Robert Lustig, and I'm here to recruit you in the war against bad food. And this is what's bad. With that, I wanna thank my colleagues at the UCSF Department of Pediatrics in our Weight Assessment for Teen and Child Health Clinic, UCSF Department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, and also Department of Nutritional Sciences at UC Berkeley, in particular Doctor Jean-Marc Schwarz, who is a card carrying fructose biochemist, PhD biochemist, who vetted all of these pathways that I've shown you today, and looked at this and said, \"Oh my God, it is a toxin.\" He worked in the stuff for 15 years, and he didn't even realize it was a toxin until he saw this. So, with that, I'll close. Thanks you. (audience applauds) (upbeat techno music)",

        "content": "•••   CHEAT DAYS   •••\nA question is often asked about cheat days. When meeting, friends and family, business acquaintances outside of our homes, weddings, parties etc, we are faced with situations where the food is not PBWFood compliant or the eating window can not be maintained. So the question is how to deal with it? In this post I want to cover such issues.\n1. As far as physical activity is concerned it is not critical that each day be fully compliant. It is perfectly alright to maintain a weekly average of 70,000 steps. So if you are not able to make 10,000 steps, just make up on the next day or, if you have advance notice, you can do extra steps on the day before.\n2. As far as maintaining an eating window of 8 hours is concerned, again it is no big deal. If on a particular day your eating window is longer, just make up on the adjoining day by narrowing down your eating window, as long as the weekly average is maintained at 8 hours or less.\n3. On the issue of compliance to PBWFood, it is easier if you are on a budget of two teaspoons of oil and sugar. When ever you find yourself consuming more oil or sugar than allowed, just make up for it by eating less oil and sugar on the following or the preceding days.\n4. If you are still on medications and do not have a daily allowance available to offset, the best approach is to make up by doing additional water fast, over and above your biweekly fast.\n5. When faced with buffet meals, most buffets have some dishes which are safe like salads, lentils, rice and bread. Some also have fruit salads and potato chat. You have to make your own selection.\n6. Soon the word spreads and your friends will know that you have dietary restrictions. If you are a leader within your social group, you will find that within 3 months every one will be following you. If not, but your friends are good friends they will start making some dishes for you. If not, it is time for you to drop them and make new friends.\n7. Sometimes It is not a bad idea to eat before going to such parties.\n8. If you find that you were forced to eat something unhealthy, you can always compensate by doing a 24 hour water fast the next day. My wife and I fast every week, it makes it easy to make exceptions.\n9. Remember water fasting or dry fasting are the two most powerful tools in your Arsenal. Use them whenever you confront a cheat day.",

I want to make some clarifications :\n1. I am not a doctor. I do not diagnose symptoms. I only diagnose diet and lifestyle.\n2. I can not and will not advise you on medications. That is totally your decision. My goal is to empower you to make such decisions and not to make them for you. I have told you that Dr. John McDougall asks all his patients to stop medications before starting his 10 day live in program at Santa Rosa, California. He does that because changing diet to plant based whole food, reduces your markers rapidly and continuing medication can lead to hypoglycemia amongst diabetic patients. So diabetic patients for sure need to reduce insulin and medications but in consultation with their doctors.\n3. What I coach, in terms of diet and lifestyle, will help improve your symptoms and their markers like BP, Blood Sugar, Cholesterol will improve. As these markers improve you can share them with your doctor and ask if you can reduce or stop medications. Some doctors are of old school and have been led to believe that medications for lifestyle diseases should never be stopped and continued for the whole life. They may advise you against it. In which case you may want to consider a second opinion.\n4. The latest research has shown that controlling symptoms too aggressively for a disease can damage overall health, even though it is keeping in check a particular marker for that particular disease. It is for this reason there is lot of debate in the last decade and many guidelines for aggressive medication are being revised. Not all doctors are aware of these revisions. Also such revisions have led to differences in guidelines for BP or Blood Sugar by different professional medical associations. We will discuss these matters in more detail next month when we discuss each disease in more detail.\n5. I am strictly against stopping medications before making dietary changes. I have come across case where people stop medications thinking that from tomorrow they will be on new diet anyway and then that tomorrow gets delayed because they couldn’t decide on the juicer or the sale on the juicer starts only after another week. So dietary changes get delayed. Always make sure that dietary changes precede medication reduction and not the other way round.\nAs regards to the pace at which the medications will get reduced; it is a function of your compliance to the guidelines and severity and history of illness.\nI have seen some members reduce their medication by half every week and some more or less aggressively.\nObviously, if the revised guideline is such that you should never have been on medication in the first place, your doctor would concur to stop medication immediately. For example the revised guidelines for BP are 140/90 for people under age 60 and 150/90 for ages over 60.\nThe revised guidelines for Diabetic is A1C of 7.9. So if your A1C is over 8.0 you must continue on medication but if less than you must reduce medication.\nI hope I have clarified some doubts as to how and when to get off medications.",

        "content": "•Why One Diet for All Ills?•\nMost people who join my health group bring a belief with them that there must be a different diet plan recommendation  for different illnesses. Even though my post on the very first day of the session, clarifies that there is only one diet, for all ills, the most frequently asked questions is “I have following symptoms....x, y, z, what should my diet be?\nThis is probably the biggest myth, even surpassing the protein myth.\nJust imagine,  you were suffering  from diseases X, Y and Z and you were prescribed the\nfollowing diet:\nFor disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P\nFor disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R\nand avoid  C, G, M, S & Q\nFor disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S\nand avoid  A, G, K, P & T\nNow, how will you figure out what to eat and what to avoid. The premise, that there is a special diet for every disease, is fundamentally flawed. When you eat PBWF diet with a diverse variety, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and all deficiencies are removed. So, there is no special need for supplements. Similarly, when you eat a variety of foods and allow your body to decide when you have had enough, as opposed to force feeding one supplement or the other, there are no excesses. There are exceptions to this rule, but most relate to (1) when you are eating processed refined foods which disturb the natural balance of nutrients (2) When you consume medications which may interfere with absorption of some nutrients over other (3) When you consume supplements, they interfere with body’s ability to absorb other nutrients, creating imbalances.\nIt is for these reasons, my highest priority is, to help you get off medications and supplements (except B12). Once you achieve that, and are off all medications, your body recuperates and achieves a proper balance. My recommendation to “eat everything you like and some that you don’t” is to ensure that you are getting a diverse variety of food. My insistence on eating berries, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices is also to provide a diverse variety. Superfoods like Aamla, Giloy, Turmeric, Garlic, Haritaki, Tulsi, Bibhitaki etc. should be made a part of daily food recipes, rather than taking them as supplements.\nThose who know cooking, know that different spices need to be added in different amounts; you can’t add as much cayenne pepper as coriander powder in a dish. One obviously needs to learn these things as a part of cooking classes and not nutritional coaching. This is not my area of expertise, and my guideline is quite simple; listen to your body, if it likes the food have more, if it doesn’t agree with it, stop.\nCertain groups and organizations benefit from propagating this myth. They want you to believe that this is a very complex science and you need to visit them and under their supervision alone your health will improve. I remember when my wife visited Jindal Spa in Bangalore she was told that every patient will receive a different diet which is customized for them. It created a sense of awe as to how refined these people are. I see this happening all around. Ayurveda masters telling you that you have to visit there center and live for a month to get cured. This is not necessary. It is not a difficult science at all. You do not need to go to any spa or Ayurvedic retreat; you can realize the benefits at the privacy of your home. If you want to get pampered, then go to a spa but it isn’t necessary for the health reasons. These are all marketing gimmicks used to make you feel weak and deprived.",

        "content": "••FACTS from FICTION••\nHow to Navigate among Varying Opinions on Social Media?\nThis question gets asked often. The social media and specially YouTube is full of varying opinions so how do I navigate it. Here are some suggestions which I practice.\n1. One must eliminate all anecdotal evidences. Videos by people of their personal experiences.\n2. One must eliminate self appointed coaches who are not educationally qualified. For example just because your coach at gym has a great body doesn’t mean that the protein powder he is pushing you to buy will get you that body. YouTube is full of those.\n3. Having narrowed down to qualified people like nutritionists, doctors, professors and PhDs, try to understand their logic in the explanation, is it consistent with what you have learned so far; if not, is the evidence based on double blind studies that have been peer reviewed. Do you smell bias based on food, Pharma or health care industries interest. Was the research funded by independent agency like National Institute of Health (NIH) or some other well recognized international organization or university.\n4. Does the expert have an ax to grind or a turf to protect. Does he have a conflict of interest.\n5. Now if there are genuine differences in the recommendations of the two experts, apply some acid test. Is the expert following his own advice? Does his health and physical appearance support his argument. Dr. Atkins advised everyone to follow his low carb high fat diet to lose weight but he himself was grossly overweight. When he died at the age of 72 he weighed 258 pounds. Many proponents of dairy and keto diets are overweight themselves.\nThose who survive to this point may be honest in their disagreements. When two doctors, I respect, are in conflict,  I apply some common sense and evaluate other available data, to come to my decision. I look at the findings from human evolutionary perspective as I discussed in my very first post on human evolution. Here are some examples of conflicts among the doctors I respect and follow:\n1. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn doesn’t approve of fat even in natural forms like avocado, nuts and seeds. When you analyze his experience, he deals primarily with advanced stage heart patients who have been given a short life to live. His success rate is already 99.5%. Why should he change? He can’t afford to take any additional risk.\n2. Dr.John McDougall is opposed to more vegetables and fruits beyond a few servings. He wants you to eat more starch. That has been his life’s body of work and all his books are focused on that. He has no objection to raw fruits and vegetables; he just feels that they won’t fill your stomach. His argument against them is week and he does have a turf to protect. I do consider him my guru but I disagree on restricting fruits, vegetables.\n3. Dr. McDougall in his seminars is very opposed to nuts and seeds beyond one oz. total. Most of his patients are fat and overweight, so I don’t blame him. In India I come across many patients who are underweight (BMI under 18.5), I advise them to increase consumption from the nuts & seeds group.\n4. Dr. Fuhrman recommends high consumption of fruits and vegetables but he sells food supplements that he manufactures. Most PBWF doctors disagree with that.\n5. Most of these doctors have developed a turf that they believe in and want to protect and have arguments to support them which sound reasonable on the surface and they are slow to adopt new research. For example many have not adopted the recent developments on fasting. I was quick to adopt that because of my Indian background, it resonated with me. Also two Nobel prizes (2016 and 2018) are pretty convincing.\n6. Dr. Jason Fung was the first to adopt fasting as a way to treat Diabetes. Before him fasting was a novelty, as a treatment of last resort. There were only few clinics worldwide. However Dr. Jason Fung’s focus on keto diet has been widely debunked but there is strong backing by the animal food industries.\nAs you can see there is no agreement even among the knowledgeable people.\nOver the years and based on the feedback from thousands of members, my guidelines have evolved to where they are today.",

        "content": "•••• 2 Most Frequently Asked Questions ••••\nI will be opening the group for Q&A now. But before I do that I want you to understand that many of the most frequently asked questions are flawed to begin with. Here are two examples.\n1. “What should my diet be to prevent diabetes, stroke, heart attack, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, etc.?”\nThe problem with this question is that it assumes a different diet is needed to prevent each disease. If that were true, how would we choose which disease to prevent and which one to ignore? This logic simply doesn’t hold.\nA truly healthy diet should benefit all chronic diseases. The PBWF/IF/10K diet and lifestyle I recommend does exactly that — it helps prevent and even reverse most chronic conditions.\nOf course, for individuals with advanced disease, organ failure, or artificial implants, medical advice specific to their condition is necessary. That said, most elements of the diet are benign and generally safe. One notable exception is for those with advanced kidney disease, where some green leafy vegetables high in oxalates may need to be restricted.\n2. “I have this symptom, and that one… what should my diet be?”\nHere again, the same principle applies.\nNutrient deficiencies (or excesses) show up as symptoms, but those symptoms vary widely from person to person. While our genetics are quite similar, epigenetically we are all unique — so the symptoms of same deficiency might look completely different in different individuals.\nWhat makes matters more complicated is that we usually don’t suffer from just one deficiency. When multiple deficiencies (or toxic excesses) are involved, the number of symptom combinations becomes enormous — possibly thousands or even millions. Expecting a doctor to diagnose these just by listening to your symptoms is unrealistic.\nThis is why treatment, whether conventional or alternative, often feels like trial and error. Another issue is reporting bias — people who don’t benefit from a treatment usually stay silent, but those who experience improvement tell everyone. For instance, someone might say, “I had this issue for 10 years, saw 10 doctors, and nothing worked. But this homeopath/Ayurvedic/alternative doctor cured me.” Excited, they share their experience with 10 others. The 9 others who didn’t benefit say nothing — but the one who did spreads the word widely, creating a false impression of a miracle cure.\nThe strength of the PBWF/IF/10K approach is that it naturally eliminates both deficiencies and excesses (which can also be toxic), allowing the body to heal. That’s why I recommend starting with a 3–5 day green juice fast. It offers deep detoxification and high-density nutrition — a powerful foundation for recovery.\nMost problems we experience are systemic in nature and are result of many years of consuming unhealthy food and living an unhealthy lifestyle. It is not a good idea to correct the symptoms (high blood pressure or high blood sugar or high LDL cholesterol etcetera), even if you could, without addressing the root cause of them. Correcting symptoms with some concoction (Nani ka Nuskha) or herb is not a good idea. At least you are now conscious of the problem and willing to do something about it. If the symptoms are lowered without correcting the root cause, you will develop a false sense of relief. Your body will keep getting sicker and sicker and come back with bigger problems like heart attack or stroke. Killing messengers is never a good idea.\nWhen you follow the 12 point guidelines the root causes of lifestyle diseases get addressed and your body heals. And when the body heals, everything heals.\nI am posting below the 12 point guidelines again in a summarized table. Please print it and post it on your refrigerator or desk. I get asked many times to repeat it.",

        "content": "I've seen family members beyond suffer at the hands of disease. I've lost family members at the hands of disease. My mum is an example which I find incredibly difficult to talk about. The reason why I'm doing this documentary comes down to my mum. I've got no brothers, I've got no sisters, I've got no father, I didn't know him. My mum was my mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my world. And she's now no longer with us. She actually had stage IV lung cancer. They said she had COPD and they gave her an Asthma pump. Even if the doctor thought she had COPD, I thought: there has to be another way! Let's get to the cause of the problems instead of treating the symptom. My mother saw this place before it was built. We stood here, she said: \"You have to build this.\" \"This may be too late for me, but you have to build it so that people have somewhere to go where they can heal.\" I vowed that if there is anything I can do to evoke change, to try and help somebody, to say: \"Maybe there is another way.\" That's what we're going to find out. We're seeing an increase in cancer and diabetes. It doesn't matter now that you're 10 years old or 80 years old. All ages are plagued with very serious illnesses. It's getting more dangerous and more difficult to keep your defenses up. We're chronically over toxified. Toxins in the medication we're taking, toxins in the food and water supply. These lifelong medications have lifelong side effects in millions and millions of people. There's no question in my mind that we're not winning the war on disease. We're at a crisis point! If something doesn't change, all these disease are going to escalate. Hello Jason! I'm going already. Crohn's disease, that's what I have. Oh, I’m so stupid… I can't believe I'm crying so much. The majority of my life I've spent ill, sick. I think it's a very difficult thing to live with. Just effected every single aspect of my life. My number one problem is Ulcerative Colitis. I don't take medication because all of the medication that they prescribed had steroids and I started getting cataracts in both my eyes. I'll tell you what this shows me: How many people that medical intervention is clearly not working! All of this stuff is not natural and shouldn't be happening to a 26-year-old. Now on a daily basis these are some of the medications I take. I'm now carrying 135kg, and I cannot carry this weight. There are so many massive issues to deal with. I have a very long list of ailments. I can say honestly I've not felt well for 25 years. I don't see that changing. I need to try, but at my age who knows how that's going to go. I don't know if SuperJuiceMe is going to work for everyone. But you can't not try. I'm very overweight and I've tried everything to lose weight. She represents so many people out there. I need to do this, for my health, for my children. The last thing I'm going to try will be weight loss surgery. Please pick me, I've tried everything. To be able to be in a position where there's a chance that this experiment could possibly help even one of them. Then it's been worthwhile. In fact you can't watch any of these videos and not care deeply. Well, they're here! The SuperJuicers have arrived, in the middle of nowhere, in Portugal. Here at Juicy Oasis they are going to embark on a journey of having nothing but freshly extracted juice for 28 days as part of my big juice experiment. My name is John Zorrer, I’m 29 years old I've got Ulcerative Colitis which is an auto-immune disease. I'm a 29-year-old who should be having the time of my life. I should be able to do all sorts of things. I feel like I'm 60 years old! I can't do normal things or I don't want to do them because I feel like I'm going to be sick and it's just not fun. My name is Estelle, I'm 26. When I was 17, I developed Asthma. I get really shaky after I take my inhaler. I don't see that as being a definite solution or a cure of any sort. It's going to help you with the shortness of breath but it's not going to help you with the asthma, it's just going to help you get through the day not the whole month or life. Hi I'm Betsy Pauly. I will be 52 next week I have a long list of problems. It started with lupus about 23 years ago. I don't know what it is to feel good. If you were to ask me today I would tell you that I feel good. But my good is not your good. Because you can look healthy. I mean, you walk around, you get the job done. I mean, being a mother you always get the job done. I'm Roger Gale and I'm 67 years. I've got sleep apnea and so I have to wear a breathing machine at night. I have hyperglycemia and worst of all, I have lupus. I know that there are many people in far more unfortunate circumstances but I've been relatively healthy and active for all of my life without any illness, so it comes as horrible shock to me. The worst aspect is that I cannot do all of the things that I plan to do. My name is Sarah Crosby, I'm 22. I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when I was 10. It can affect any part of the digestive system from the mouth to the back passage. Unfortunately, I have it everywhere. I'm a big believer in the fact that fruits and vegetables can help you. If that didn't happen and my Crohn's got worse it would really hit home that maybe I will be on medication for the rest of my life. My name is Lewis. I'm 22 years old. I've got problems with my weight and being able to walk and things like that. I use food as a massive blanket. I use it when I'm happy I use it when I'm sad I use it as a reward I use it for everything. It's so annoying because I don't want to be addicted to food. I'm Erika, I'm 33. My weight is my first problem. I'm obese. Running around after the children, I can't really do that because of my size. We should be able to go out at the weekend at the park. I can't! I've got two beautiful kids that need their mum. I feel like I'm letting them down. My name is Andrew Morris. I am 51. I suffer with a condition called pulmonary sarcoidosis. I've also got asthma, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea and Type II Diabetes. It's weird for people to understand, but I can go to sleep and dream of waking up and just not taking tablets. I originally planned to have 6 of them but after seeing all their videos there was no way that I could only pick 6, so there are 8 of them here they have 22 different diseases between them. It's going to be interesting to see what happens, mentally and physically when they're just living on juice for 28 days. So if the the medical profession seems unable to treat these guys, why do I think I can help? Well, I have a theory and it all starts with a fish. Think of a fish living in natural, clean, nutrient-rich water. The chances are it will live a disease-free life. But would will happen to the fish if you pollute the water? If you poured, say, cola into the bowl? Or some salty potato chips? Or greasy fatty foods like burgers and pizza? What do you think is going to happen? Well, all living creatures have a natural filtration system that can handle a certain amount of just about anything. But if you keep adding more junk into the water the body is going to start to struggle. The poor fish is going to start showing symptoms of \"disease\". It might get a skin condition. It might get asthma. It might become fat or obese. Perhaps it gets a headache or a cough. It might get arthritis and can't move its fin so well. These symptoms are warning lights telling the body there's something wrong. So what's the best way to treat the fish? Medical intervention might suggest that you give it medicine to treat the headache. Or a different medicine to stop it coughing. Or further medicine to help it move its fin. Perhaps more medicines to treat the side-effects of the first medicines. That might treat the symptoms but even the medicines add pollution to the bowl. It seems painfully obvious to any rational thinking person what the solution is. Would you want to give the fish more medicine? Of course you wouldn't! The answer is so simple. If you want to treat the cause of the problem, you need to clean the water. So that's effectively what our SuperJuicers are here to do. To clean the terrain where their cells bathe to clean \"the water\" in other words. It's that simple! All chronic degenerative diseases are caused by two major problems: toxicity and deficiency! We're living in an over-toxic world, and we're living at a time where we're also consuming foods that are devoid of nutrients, and as that toxicity and deficiency becomes manifested in our body it results in disease. We have to detoxify, and flood the body with nutrients. We should address the toxicity and replenish the nutrients in our bodies if we're looking to heal ourselves. Once you understand the cause you got the answer for the cure! The thing that got me into juicing was the fact that it made so much sense. It was the perfect way to get \"live\" nutrition going into my body because even to this day I still don't like certain vegetables. I hate broccoli with a passion! You've got to remember, I was a junk food addict. So to go from that to broccoli, my taste buds didn't really want to know. I read a book that said that all fruits and vegetables was full of over 85% pure organic liquid fuel and it's only this fuel that fed the body. It's rapid nutrition into the cells. The idea of rapid nutrition really appealed to me. I thought: \"If I can't eat them, can I drink them?\" I'll be honest, the thought of drinking broccoli juice was even worst than the thought of eating it! But you know what? When you extract the juice and mix it with a little bit of apple a little bit of pineapple a bit of pear, some ginger and if you try different combinations. I got so excited! I remember even to this day, I called my mum I said: \"Mum you'll never guess what! I'm drinking vegetables!\" This has got to be good for you! It's fresh fruits and vegetables converted into juice right there on the spot! How can you do better than that? Do you see how simple this is? These plants contain all the elements of life and growth in them. I tell you now, if there is a system that can get me to have vegetables then I knew this would work for anybody! I am absolutely ready for the journey. It's a journey to health, to learning about what nutrition can do for my body. This opportunity, it's the mark of a new start, of a new life for me. I'm kind of scared of a whole month, it sounds like a lot! People have done it. I'm not someone who usually has that type of drive. If you took the medication out of the equation I could live a normal life. And that's what I'd like. I think that's going to give it to me. So, here we go! [MUSIC] Eurgh! Ooh! That's all right isn't it?! Thanks! It's not as bad as I thought! I like it! The orange is disgusting, could I have some more wheatgrass please? [MUSIC] Pow! I've been on the juice for nearly 2 days now and surprisingly, I feel very good! Actually, I feel really good! I feel pretty terrific! [MUSIC] There we go! On the 13th of July 1962, I was born. And I feel now I'm going to be reborn. It's my rebirth! That's it! Thank you! Let's turn that off. Craving food today. Craving a lot of food. I want food! I just want a quick high! I sound like a heroin addict! [JASON]: If the SuperJuicers are being fed everything they need then why does Lewis feel like a heroin addict missing his fix? They’re not missing food at all. They’re having more genuine nutrition than they've had in years. They’re almost missing a drug in a way. It's like an addict coming off a drug, that's the only way I can describe it. Imagine the big food industry is like a squirrel who's selling nuts. It wants to sell more nuts because, of course, it wants to make more money. Normally in the wild animals won't eat unless they are genuinely hungry. So it can only sell nuts when its customers are hungry right? Wrong! All it needs to do is cook the nuts and add 3 highly addictive substances: fat salt and sugar! Now, something truly incredible happens! These new roasted flavored nuts have become highly addictive. They create what amounts to a false hunger. Your body is no longer satisfied when you eat them. Your natural hunger cut-off point is gone. Now, the squirrel's customers will keep buying and eating until they end up with an obese squirrel. And the big food industry is doing exactly same to us. They're manipulating our food so that we eat more and more and more. Big food is responsible for the biggest addiction facing western society today. If you into any restaurant or you're going to any mainstream supermarket we're getting poor nutrition and we're getting toxicity. It's corn, and soy, and wheat, and sugar, and salt, and chemicals. That's primarily what people are eating. Add all of the preservatives and additives used in food processing, from MSG's, to artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, for instance and also the preservatives are some of the worst that you can get in your body. So we're eating these on a daily basis. We're eating a diet that is very sparse on vegetables and replete with monoculture foods that have been spun out of factories and dumped into boxes or packages, and they do not contain life! Where is our life? You don't actually know what you're eating any more. When you eat one item, it really is composed of 25 different things. Say you're having some sort of fast-food hamburger that in the States are made-up of 50% corn and generally, it's genetically modified. Then the other 50% comes from upwards of 100 different cows. You have to ask yourself: \"What am I really eating anymore?\" The biggest thing that's wrong with the food that they were eating before is that it wasn't genuinely feeding them. Most people are overfed and undernourished. They're constantly hungry because their cells are genuinely starving! You don't often think of somebody being morbidly obese, and think that they are starving. But the irony is, that's precisely what's happening. If I carried on the way I was going, eating all the rubbish You don't realize how addictive all the white starchy refined sugar stuff is. I mean, this week I've not been hungry. I got the headaches, the withdrawal in the beginning, but I can honestly say I've not been hungry. If I go out to my favorite Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet, by the time I get home, I'd be hungry because it's not feeding my body what it actually needs. It's feeding it for a little while and then it realizes that it needs the vitamins, and the nutrients and it's hungry for them. Convenience and an instant gratification lifestyle has become become the norm. So many companies have come in to fill that instant gratification need. There's a lot of money to do research, to figure out what's going to trick your taste buds and there's a lot of money to figure out the best way to sell things. So what happens is you basically become addicted to fake foods. They're packaged up in all sorts of different forms and sold to us as being even healthy and they're anything but that! So, our tongue tastes it and says, \"Oh it must be good for you!\" Well, its just shaped like something that's good but it's not really good for you. It's actually really bad for you. And food companies, they know this. It's a billion, billion dollar industry. They know how to trick you! Anything that says \"fat-free\" is usually loaded with white refined sugar. If something says \"sugar-free\", chances are it has artificial sweeteners in. You want to know why overweight people are insatiably hungry? One of them is artificial sweeteners and artificial flavor enhancers. For example: MSG. Now MSG itself doesn't really taste good but it makes you become addicted to the food and it makes you want to eat more and more of it. So that's great for food companies. Because you're going to eat more they're going to sell more. It's perfect for them, it's just horrible for you. Sigh! Everyone wants to talk about food today. Cheeseburgers and french fries. All-you-can-eat Chinese buffet. Boiled ham. Ice cream. Pasta. Bread and butter. A big stack of ribs with barbecue sauce. I just want a ham and cheese toasty... Chips, I definitely love chips. Apple danish pastries. ..not with normal cheese, with soft cheese... Macaroni salad. Chocolate. ..the ham and the bread... Mashed potato. Steak! Ooh steak! I don't want to keep talking about this stuff. It's starting to make me get back to those thoughts. And those thoughts are actually starting to leave! If I said to somebody: \"Look a banana is going to cause obesity, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, eczema, psoriasis, high blood pressure, cholesterol\" and I say, \"Look, all you need to do is stop eating bananas.\" they would just stop eating bananas. They'd find it easy, even if they love them. But if you said: \"Stop eating white refined sugar, refined fats, or chocolate or alcohol or things like coffee\" there is an emotional attachment. Addiction to me is If the thought of never doing it again fills with you with an \"abnormal\" fear then your hooked if it doesn't then you're not. I usually have chocolate bars to cover up my problems and my insecurities and having to deal with everything face on is really, really tough. I feel like this is something I have to do to be able to move on in my life I've been eating chocolate crisps, cola, all that kind of stuff for 20 years. It's time to treat my body with the respect I should've given it years ago. The cost of our instant gratification life is that we're becoming more overweight we're becoming more unwell and we're suffering as a result of these diseases of lifestyle the diseases of nutrition, and the diseases of toxicity. We're seeing new diseases like Lou Gehrig's disease, scleroderma, lupus we are seeing an escalation of Alzheimer's disease we're seeing an increase in cancer and diabetes we're going to see continued escalation of obesity. Right now we're at a crisis point, and if something doesn't change all of these diseases are going to continue to escalate. And who would have thought fruits and veg would make you feel so good and also bad as well. It's not the fruit and veg that's making you feel bad at all. The toxins in your body that are just getting flushed out. And boy, they have been getting flushed out! I just did the cross-trainer for 10 minutes and I started having a small wheeze in my chest. It wasn't like the really painful one where I can't even breathe anymore. I took like 5 puffs of the inhaler before being on the treadmill. I jogged for a total of 5 minutes. As stupid as it may seem, that has never happened! It's crazy that today is Day 5 and that would be an effect. When I arrived, I realized that a few medications I was going to bring are missing from my bag. I did get in touch with my doctor, and she was even a little nervous, but she said since I'm coming to a place like this, that I probably don't need to worry about it too much. Maybe this happened for a reason. I have been trying to get off my meds. I think this is perfect for me. The answer to my prayers This is my CPAP machine, which is Continual Positive Air Pressure. I have to sleep with this. It's my significant other. And for the sake of her sanity, my wife sleeps elsewhere. [LOUD BUZZING] Right this is my CPAP. What it does is like I'm taking a breath. It forces the air into me, so I can't help but breathe. I'm going to hit the hay! I have only been on juice for nearly 5 days now and to be honest I've really been struggling the last few days. My ulcerative colitis has been flaring up, big time. It's been causing me a lot of stomach pains, cramping and diarrhea. I'm going to the bathroom about 10 times a day. And it's just very painful. It feels like this is getting worse, before it gets better. For me, a sign that I'm getting better would be more normal bowel movements and less pain in my stomach. I've been untreated for ulcerative colitis for over 6 years 'cause the treatments they offered started making me go blind. I don't normally just cry but this has been very emotional. I want to go home but if I was offered like: \"Do you want to go home?\" I would probably go home. First of all I thought: \"I wonder if you can get any juice from the apple?\" It's called apple juice, this is ridiculously stupid! We are so far removed from doing it ourselves. We're so used to buying everything in a carton. We're so used to the apple juice looking like you've had a pee! There are two apple juices here. I'd like to do a visual so you can see the difference. Now what's happened here, is it this is still alive, see the rich creamy head? What do I think of Andy's suitcase full of drugs? That says it all! He's got two suitcases in his room, one full of clothes. The other one full entirely of medical drugs! There we have my tablets. I'm here for four weeks and I've had to bring a suitcase because of the amount I'm taking. I'm hoping this journey is going to get rid of most of it. And I can't wait for that! I also take steroids. Now steroids come with a hunger factor. It's quite scary how fast your weight can increase when you start taking them. I've been taking them for 13 years and I would not like to see my insides because the outside is bad enough! If I can get rid of the steroids, it would be a dream, it really would. The thing that inspired me to do this big juice experiment was my own ill health It's hard to imagine now but I was covered from head to foot, in an skin condition called Psoriasis an auto-immune disease where the skin repairs itself faster than it should and produces these scales on the outside the body. I had severe Eczema. I had severe Hay fever to the point where I couldn't leave my house. It wasn't just small amounts of hay fever, itchy eyes. I mean it was like the worst flu you've ever had every single summer for long periods of time, The thing affected my life a great deal was my severe Asthma. I had really, really bad asthma. For my Asthma I was given the blue Ventolin inhaler, the brown one, which was the steroid based one at the time, I even got some steroid tablets. Not once did anybody even look at what could be causing the problem. They just wanted to treat the symptoms. With our chronic diseases, we manage them, we don't cure them, and we don't seem to want to cure them! We lower cholesterol, we try to lower blood sugar, we relieve pain in Arthritis, and we give medications for pulmonary disease, but basically there's no attention given to trying to cure these. This is the injection I take. It's an immunosuppressant, although it takes away the inflammation of my Crohn's, the side effect is that I'm open to every cold and virus and pretty much anything I come in contact with which is why I was hospitalized 3 times this year! I got a virus in my heart and my heart rate dropped quite low. The doctors didn't really know what was happening. They thought maybe I was either really fit they said Muhammad Ali has a resting heart rate of 32 beats per minute. I was like: \"I don't think that's me. I think there must be something wrong.\" This is what at the moment I'm injecting myself with every 2 weeks. I'd love to go back to only having to take them maybe once a month. And you know, ideally, nothing altogether. It would be great to be free of medication. I'd love to be up to just and delay having to take it so. Medicine, we know, doesn't fix anything. It doesn't correct anything, and a medicine is a toxin. It usually interferes with something naturally that's supposed to take place in your body. Not one single person will be cured of heart disease, pulmonary disease, stroke, arthritis, obesity, diabetes with our current medical approach. In spite of all the technology, all the medications all the research and money we throw at these problems we are not conquering chronic disease! I think the pharmaceutical industry is disempowering. They give people a very simple solution here’s a pill, that's it! You don't need to worry about anything else. Just the mere fact that they think this is protecting them stops them from looking at what is making them ill in the first place. \"If you are worried about high cholesterol or heart disease\" \"then ask your doctor about Lypintol.\" \"Lypintol is a prescription medicine\" \"that is proved to reduce the risk of heart attack and stoke.\" \"Lypintol should not be taken by people with liver problems.\" \"Your doctor can provide a simple blood test to check your liver.\" If you're in the U.S. you'll see a plethora of drug commercials on TV. These drug commercials are targeted at helping alleviate people's problems and we have a lot of problems! \"Some people can experience allergic reactions to Lypintol\" \"some of which can be life-threatening.\" \"Tell your doctor straightaway if you have an allergic reaction\" \"that causes swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat\" \"or affects your breathing.\" \"The most common side affects include nausea, nose bleeds, headaches\" \"memory loss, insomnia, nightmares, and an increased risk of diabetes.\" You know, if you tried to sell anything under the sun that has side effects of liver damage, of kidney damage, of new diseases or even cancer and death you wouldn't be able to sell that! But they advertise these stuff all along and the public buys those things. All they are looking for is relief of their symptoms. We want a quick fix for our modern problems. And the pharmaceutical industry has promised us those quick fixes. But they're not really communicating the costs of those quick fixes. They're drugging them, and drugging them, and drugging them. And the drugs have side effects! I have to put my reading glasses on, because the writing is very small. Wow! This is incredible! Right out of the chute, endometrial cancer cardiovascular disorders, breast cancer And probable dementia. Wow! Memory loss, again, I presented with it, that causes it, this causes it! Worsening, trouble breathing, coughing and wheezing Dry mouth, nausea, stomach pain Lowered resistance to infections Confusion, shortness of breath Half of that is side effects Feeling sick, weight gain, stomach ulcers Feeling or being sick pain Chest pain, coughing up mucus and blood Feeling, seeing, or hearing things which do not exist Blindness Fever, headache Bronchitis, bruising, difficulty speaking Shock Increase pressure in the skull causing painful eyes, changes in vision Shakiness, nervousness Rashes Loss of bladder control, hair loss and unusual thoughts Symptoms of TB may happen Headaches Pneumonia Cataracts Retinal vascular thrombosis Irregular heartbeat Feeling depressed including thinking about suicide Psychosis, anorexia, osteoporosis Ringing in the ears Exacerbation of other conditions Loss of consciousness Feeling dependent or addicted to this product Death Death! If these occur, please inform your doctor. Right! So if I die, I will tell my doctor. Death is a side effect! Ha! Ha! [JASON]: I want to make it clear that I'm not saying that here isn't a place for medical intervention because clearly there is. I am not anti-medicine. For example, if you're in a car crash and your leg is broken, then clearly a few dream catchers, an aura cleanse or juice poured all over your leg are not the first things you need. What you're probably going to need is to go to hospital get some proper medical attention. And then after that you might want some juice or other therapies to support the healing process. But the point is that you need to achieve the right balance. If I have a chronic disease of lifestyle, caused by how I eat how I live, how I react to stress and the toxins in my environment I need to do something about it that's different different than going to the mainstream medical profession. I need to address those causes and the best way to address those causes is through diet and lifestyle. For the long-term management of illness you want to wean people off their medicines and start fixing the patient. [JASON]: The turning point that made me move away from the medical profession was I'd been offered treatment after treatment after treatment. Nothing was getting better at all. I think the real crunch for me came when the dermatologist said \"For your psoriasis, what I'd like to do is put some coal tar treatment on you.\" And I said: \"Coal tar, that sounds like stuff you make a road with\" He said: \"That is what it is!\" I said: \"You want to put it on my skin?\" They said: \"Yeah we'll put it on your skin put you in hospital for six weeks and cover you in bandages.\" It was at that point, I thought: \"There's got to be another way.\" Up until now I've never, ever read the sheets. They're there for communication so people can read about things but they're horror sheets! Now reading them, reading the possible side effect as in: can happen on an every day basis? That's outrageous! No, I'm seriously considering what tablets I take, now. [MUSIC] Yesterday my stomach was acting-up just a little bit, but today I feel right on form! I really do. [MUSIC] I love being out here in the lake. It's so beautiful and peaceful. Hardly anybody takes advantage of it. And when you're hurting I think it's the best thing you could possibly do for yourself. It's nice to get some alone time. Shoo-be-doo-be-doo! Cheers! I have degenerative disk, so my lower-back has always bothered me. But I just recently had a spinal-fusion in my neck. That was actually an emotional one for me! I was able to do things that I thought I'd never be able to do with the spinal surgery and the shoulder surgery. So, it was awesome! Yeah, it's good to feel, I'm clearly healing. I can't wait to do it again! I'll probably cry again, too. [MUSIC] I still am fighting a roller coaster battle. I feel like I should be further along than I am. So it's just been a really tough for me. Okay, Jon's Colitis is not clearing up as rapidly as I first anticipated so as part of the big juice experiment I'm just going to add in extra juice to see if it makes any difference. It's based on a study I've seen about cabbage juice and Ulcerative Colitis. Now, John remains very skeptical about whether this is going to work. He also doesn't want to drink it cause cabbage is not the nicest tasting juice in the world. But we are going to mix it with a little bit of apple. I am blindly optimistic and again it can't do any harm but it would be interesting to see if this works. It looks like a beer that has too much foam on the top. It's like not even going away! I guess there's nothing to do except for to try it, right? Wait, I think I might have to actually do this with a straw because there's so much foam in here. Can I take this foam out, or no? It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be it's really not as bad as I thought it was going to be. [CLAPPING] There you go. That's what I did! I like red cabbage in salads. There's nothing wrong with that at all. It's wonderful. Terrific even! Well, there's a surprise! This journey is all about surprises and another one is I never thought I'd ever drink a cabbage The mechanism behind all of our chronic diseases is inflammation. Inflammation is the response to injury. Toxins do cause injury, injury causes inflammation. If we take a look at what we've done differently, it's the things we eat. We’ve gotten away from real food. Everything is processed. I mean we don’t eat an apple any more, we eat applesauce! And it’s loaded up with sugars and preservatives and other sorts of things that are potentially toxic And in my opinion, that dietary change is the cause of most of these diseases. As we're consuming modern foods we're accumulating toxins within the body. As we accumulate toxins within the body, we're becoming prone to illness. And that illness depends on our genetic predisposition. It depends on where our genetic weaknesses is in the body. Many of diseases are just manifestations from the same thing. and the solution is about improving the nutrient quality of your food detoxifying, and addressing stress and emotional issues. It just stands to reason and common sense if the majority of those diseases are caused by diet and lifestyle then the simple answer, surely, is to change the diet and lifestyle and then they'll just get better. Since I've been out here I haven't had any symptoms which is incredible. I'm just kind of blown away by that. And I actually arrived with medication the doctor gave me just in case my symptoms flare up. I used to be on it once a month and because my dependancy has increased so much on it and the few days leading up to the injection I get quite ill. So I know that it's time to take the injection again. But since I've come out here I haven't needed the injection. Tomorrow will be a week over when I'm due it and show no symptoms. So, yeah, it’s going well. There’s only one place that we should be looking for our long term health It's the same place wild animals look for health and nutrition It’s nature! We are the only creatures in the world that cook our food. You don’t see a gorilla with a BBQ! If you were on an island you would find fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and animal protein. Our bodies understand that. You can eat all those that you want and you will be enormously healthy. Once you start mixing other things in it causes such hormonal chemical chaos that your body just doesn't know what to do with it. If we got back to eating real foods real thing that were made or grown on the land instead of produced in a factory we would have a better chance to avoid these toxins and a better chance to avoid the consequences of inflammation. We should be juicing because so many people have impaired digestive tracts. And digestion is impaired because of the diet we've been on. Along come your beautiful juices. They go right into your intestinal tract. And those nutrients get absorbed into your system. They're going right to work within about 20 or 30 minutes. There they're feeding your body, rejuvenating, giving you energy giving your body life. This is why you should juice! Juicing is the perfect antithesis to the failures of the modern diet. I think it is the exact opposite of a Happy Meal. It is the exact opposite of some fast-food junk that we're eating. We've heard \"you are what you eat\" right? And it's so true! We eat things that are dehydrated, that are void of nutrients then we start to look and feel dehydrated, sickly, void of nutrients. We eat things like fresh green juice that are a plethora of nutrients and vitamins and hydrates the body, then you start to look younger. You start to look fresher, you start to feel more energetic and more passionate and have more purpose in life because you're actually feeling better. Juices are very alkaline, so they help you detoxify your body which is essential for weight loss to help you reduce inflammation. And it's the best way to get energy and vitality. It's going to make you feel like a new person. You're going to notice all sorts of improvements you haven't noticed for, maybe a long, long time. I was walking with one hand on my shorts. I can just slip in and out of these shorts without undoing the buttons. It's like, I should imagine, putting on a dress not that I've ever done that! Even though, I know I'm going to have to buy more clothes it's a lovely feeling. It's really brilliant! I know I'm doing well now. It's brilliant. I've got space! I got so enthusiastic about juicing, I saw everything start clearing up. My skin started to improve. My Asthma vanish within a month. I mean, that was just me personally but within one month after suffering with it for years and years and years ever since the age of eight, in fact. My Hay fever cleared up. My Eczema cleared up. My weight just went down at a rate I didn't think was humanly possible. I got really evangelical about the whole thing, as you would do. I set out on a mission to juice the world and I wrote a book on it. I was giving it to everybody I knew. I said: \"Look you've got to try juicing.\" Everybody was looking at me like I had 10 heads! Nobody had really heard about juicing at the time. I started to get letters and emails from all over the world. One person would say: \"Do you know what? I did that juicing thing that you said.\" \"I did it for 7 days you know my skin started to get better\" or \"My Fibromyalgia started to improve,\" and there appeared to be every single common ailment, condition or disease that it was improving in some way. I honestly believe that freshly extracted juice has the potential to help millions of people all around the world. It's the most important thing you'll ever have happen to your body as far as nutrients coming to your 100 trillion cells. Because juicing is an immediate absorption of food values. I know what's going to happen. It's going to happen even after this film goes out. \"Where they going to get their protein?\" \"Where they going to get their calcium?\" Let's look at this logically. You get somebody like Andy who is suffering so many different diseases. He is morbidly obese and then somebody would say \"Where are you going to get your calcium?\" as if this was an issue for him at any given time of his life! The irony is that when somebody starts doing this people panic that they're going to be nutrient deficient. If I wasn't here and I hadn't been on juice I couldn't do what I've just done! It's like I came through the doors and Andrew Morris' spirit came through and my body was left outside. If juice diet is dangerous, what I'd like for them to do is for a week, I'll take the juice diets and they can take my tablets. And then they can tell me what they think after that. That's all I've got to say on that matter! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four, three, two, one. Doing juicing is brilliant. It's given me so much energy. It's made me think about what I'm going to eat when I'm finished juicing. Because you're not thinking about -- well, you are thinking about food all the time but because you've been so long without the bad food all you start craving is the good food which is really, really good. There are some people that will say: \"When they eat normally again they're going to gain all the weight back and they might get sick again.\" Well that depends on what their idea of normal is. We each remember that their normal diet made them overweight, made them incredibly sick to begin with. We've got this 28 days that, hopefully, is going to see massive improvements. And when they leave, if they go back to their old normal diet well of course, they're going to return to normal. In fact even worse because they were going in an awful direction. When we have talks about lifestyle changes and what we're going to eat we're actually talking about very healthy foods. Salads, bean, and legumes, and rice and avocados and just wonderful things. Most people would think you're here, unable to eat food you're going to be craving chocolate, and chips and all those awful things. No, I think because your body's getting the nutrients so it's craving nutritious food not junk food. You're not in that vicious cycle. We're all talking about amazing food changes and swapping recipes for really good healthy, whole foods. When they start to eat \"normally\" again what should they look for on the label? The label! If you find any food with the label on, then maybe that's the problem. whatever you're going to eat you've got to ask yourself this simple question: \"Is it low human intervention food?\" How many humans have interfered with this food before it came to me? [TOILET FLUSHING] So I've actually felt really, really good these last couple of days. Everything seems like it's finally starting to work itself out. I actually had 4 normal bowel movements in the last 3 days which for me is incredible. It just seems like everything is sorting itself out and I feel a lot better. People are even mentioning it to me like, he way that you're sitting and the way that you're acting you just look better overall. And I feel better, I feel happy and I just feel like everything is starting to work out and I think this Colitis can ultimately go into remission or I would like to say \"cure\". I'm just really happy and nothing is going to change that at this point. Three, two, one, go! – Go for it. – Go on Roger! My word, he's flying! [MUSIC] Before we climbed up the stairs I took one puff before, kind of to prevent to have to use it. That's what I do when I run now, I just have it a bit before. [MUSIC] Is it cold? - It's awesome! Yeah I bet it is pretty freezing! - Come on bro! Daaah! S##t! That's so cold! - Is that a fish? I feel weird because I'm in a lake and I've never been in a lake until today. Makes me feel brilliant! That's my English for you! It's scary though. I feel fish everywhere, and all kind of stuff! Are you going across? Huh? [SPLUTTERING] Are you going going across? If I don't killed by a speedboat in the meantime. I want to do it again. [MUSIC] I just pick an organic orange off the tree, and juiced it and this is the result from one orange, I've drunk half of it already. It's absolutely delicious. Tastes nothing like orange juice that you buy in a carton that's for sure. [MUSIC] I've had loads of highs and lows but mostly highs. And they seemed to outweigh the lows so I just feels so much better. How do I see the future? Inhaler free, maybe? And organic, definitely! Everything is going to completely change when I go home. There's no way I'm going back to the way that I was. No way! It's just not going to happen. Everyone's going to be healthy when I get home we're going to go out for walks, we're going to do things as a family rather than my partner and the kids doing something then I wait at home for them to come back. I'm actually going to go out and do it and just enjoy my life. [MUSIC] [BIRDSONG] [MUSIC] I actually feel really good. To start off, if I was really out of breath. I couldn't catch my breath and then I just carried on through I felt really good, surprisingly! Well, actually I'm kind of impressed with my progress. I walk and I do the treadmill a little bit at home but I never would have been able to do this. I'm feeling great. And despite the few upill stretches, I'm not too out of breath. We're like we're going to enjoy this walk, take it easy, she's my buddy. No pressure to walk fast or be in the front. It just kind of sunk in today that we're going home pretty soon. So you want to enjoy the moment. I couldn't walk 50 yards. I just done 10km! How weird is that? A few weeks before I came out here I was laid off from work because I couldn't walk very far. I stepped out a bit! And it really feels brilliant! I said I'd be bloody tired, didn't I? So here I am, very tired, or exhausted even! I'd love to do it again, though! You know it seems really odd that we have reached the stage in 21st century medicine and we are still at the point that we call Alternative Medicine anything other than medical drugs. Nobody even questions that. Surely, the number one doctor is to first of all do no harm. So surely, we should try plant-based medicine first and then if that doesn't work we should seek an alternative to what is obvious and the alternative should be medical drugs. It shouldn't be the other way around. I think when it comes to looking after your health you have the power to do it. You're the one that knows your body better than anybody else. I think when we are really healthy, life becomes about nourishing. Nourishing yourself on a mental level nourishing yourself on an emotional level, nourishing your body. If you nourish all your defences and you nourish all your systems and you nourish your immune system and you nourish your brain cells and the body is detoxed, how can you feel but better? When you look at the fact that the food that you eat really creates the life that you live, everything starts to change. Juice every day. This has got to be a way of life because that's when you're going to notice your life changes. This is the bottom line to health, start doing it on a daily basis. You'll never regret it. It's the ultimate way to feed your hundred trillion internal cells. The ultimate way, there is nothing else that duplicates it. You will never know how good you can feel until you give juicing a try. One of the the main reasons I did this documentary was because of my mother's situation. I'm not saying for one second that this is some kind of cure for cancer. Nor am I saying it's a cure for anything. But what I am saying is that I strongly believe that the way that we are currently treating lifestyle diseases is flawed on so many levels. In fact, it's completely wrong. I just feel, if you just do two very simple straightforward things you simply remove the toxicity coming in, the rubbish and replace the deficiencies and the body just heals itself. [MUSIC] That's right, it's Day 28 at the Juicy Oasis Camp! I'm your host, Lewis Bray. Day 28. Wow! It's Day 28! I've been only on juice for 28 days now and finally I'm there! Day 28, ridiculous! I feel on top of the world. And I feel great. I feel fantastic. I still feel fantastic. I'm able to do far more than I ever could before. I'm really pleased with myself. The results from this experiment has absolutely astounded me, and I'm going to be a juicer for life. This just four weeks out of my life has changed the rest of my life. That's all I can say. And I'm not being paid to say it. I see now things that I've always wanted to do. I actually feel that I can do them. I've missed the kids like mad but they're getting a happier, healthier mom in four weeks. That's crazy! And when I go home I really don't know what I'm going to eat! I've been only on juice 28 days. I feel great. 28 days, a month, four weeks. I've had nothing to eat. I haven't... let me get this word right \"mas\"...\"masqueraded\"...\"mastica\" Anyway, I'm not going any further on that word. I'm excited. I really am excited for the future. This month has given me a future. [MUSIC] The weight I was really, really surprised with - 17kg, 38lbs. This was my last opportunity. It was either going to be a gastric bypass or a gastric band. This is what I needed to finally go home and sort myself out for the last time. This is, been one of the best experiences of life. I didn't think I would get as much out of it as I have. It's just been amazing. I'm so, so lucky. I've got the tools and the knowledge from being here I know that I can do this at home. I've had high cholesterol for probably 15 years. It's almost half of what it was a month ago. That was one of my big concerns, and the blood sugar and that's all within normal range. The blood pressure's normal rate. And of course the weight is an awesome plus. I lost 20lbs. I came with a lower back pain, kidney pain, hip pain that I've for a very long time. Shoulder pain, neck pain. Most of pain had been for well over a decade. A lot of went away the first week and the rest, it's all gone. I'm looking forward to getting home and having everybody see. Even if I don't say anything, they're going to see the difference in me. It would be impossible hide it. I have dropped 33lbs which is really, really good. My overall health and how I feel has just become much better. I don't crave foods to make me feel better. I don't crave chocolate. So excited to hopefully inspire someone who's sat on the couch eating a packet of crisp and wishing they weren't. And I hope they feel: \"Well if he can do it, I can do it!\" My conditions have changed dramatically. My Ulcerative Colitis, I would like to say I'm going to cure myself of it but it was a really long journey there. It took it took me like 20 days to actually even start feeling better. But now I actually see the light. I truly believe that, for me, specifically the cabbage juice it really has made a world of difference. You know, I guess the message is if you really want to be better take control of your health, do whatever it takes And even if you want to give, don't give up. Drink your juice and you know you'll be fine. And I think, if you do that then you'll be able to take your health back and take your life back. Over the 28 days I lost almost 8kg. My cholesterol went down from 6.7 to 5.9, that's good. My allergies have improved. For the Asthma part when I started I was running 4 minutes, painfully and now I run about 30 minutes and I've increased my speed quite a bit. And I walked 20km. So the results are great. I'm just more energized and motivated. My cramps and the inflammation stomach has gone down so I haven't needed the injection at all since I've been here. I've gone from being on all this medication for the doctors being backed up against the wall to not being on any medication at all. So, I'm not as dependent on medication as I originally thought or even the doctors thought. I definitely feel better for this experience. This has just been life-changing, 100%. I've been able to come off all of my medication. Because of some of the meds I was hypoglycemic. I have no hypoglycemia at all now. I have no shakes, no fainting fits, nothing! And it's life-changing for me. It's wonderful. You can only do yourself a favour if you try this. It's the best food you can put into yourself and the fastest way you can get healthy, without question. I'm taking away fantastic experience and a great deal of knowledge and what I believe is the ability to maintain my long-term health. And while I may still be 67, I certainly don't feel it. My results, I was well happy! First of all this morning, I jumped on the weighing scale and I found that I lost 38lbs, which I'm really chuffed about! I arrived as a Diabetic, I'm leaving with no sign of diabetes. The CPAP machine for Sleep Apnea is now a door weight because it's no good to me at all. If I didn't change then I really wouldn't of lasted much longer. I would have probably added another year, two years in it. But that would be it. I would have been dead and it would be too late to juice. This four weeks has really saved my life. That's a juice! That really is a juice! The results have been phenomenal. Yes, the end of the 28-day experiment for sure but I really hope this isn't the end for them. I hope this is the beginning of a life-long change. I hope they picked up the tools they learned while they've been here and they really take charge of their own health and understand that their health, from this point on really is in their own hands. To notice the big improvement in such a small amount of time I just want to get home and carry on, I feel amazing. 200% better, I feel great, I feel energized! Now I feel like I'm on a course to get progressively better and all these amazing results really give me the momentum to do that. I truly feel like I'm 100% right now which I have not felt 100% in probably 25 years. That's pretty incredible. I'm looking forward to trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle when I get back and just keep healthy basically. I feel like my attitude towards medication has changed. I know that I can go a month without my medication and it's kind of the start of something beautiful, I think. So, I'm kinda delighted. My overall health has just improved beyond all recognition. Health and happiness those are the 2 main symptoms that I'm suffering from and that's terrific for me! And now my journey has really saved my life. There's no \"if\"s, \"and\"s, or \"but\"s. It's fact! It really has and a lot changed my life. This is absolutely fantastic! I'm on the start line of the biggest half-marathon in the world. In June, I couldn't walk 300 yards, and I'm now about to do 13 miles. The library of information that I have been reading for 10 years trying to get better. Every book that I bought and every little thing that I went for I thought, \"OK, this is going to be it.\" And this actually is it! The doctor was concerned that I wasn't on medication and he said that I will never be able to cure my Crohn's disease with food. He said that point blank. And then he followed up by saying: \"By the way, your results are there's no evidence of Crohn's disease in your gut.\" I'm not having any of the pain or problems. The cabbage juice has really been a miracle for me. Well, now there's a funny old story! Once we had the interviews at the end of the 4 weeks Jason said, \"What was I going to do?\" And I couldn't think of anything else but staying, really. Now we've started, I'd really like to see it through. Well, as you know, I had 2 suitcases coming out. One was for the tablets, the other one was my clothes. Now, as I said previously I was taking 40 tablets a day. But when I actually counted them up it was actually 52 tablets a day. Now Jason did want me to go home with just one suitcase and that was my clothes, obviously. But unfortunately, still I do have to take two suitcases. One is my clothes. And a second one, well, the second one, I actually have here and that's my tablets, so, yeah, I got two tablets a day now I'm on. So I've lost 50 tablets somewhere and I'm feeling absolutely fantastic. So, yeah! Here we go!",

Some of you who joined late and might have missed that post. My interest in PBWF started after watching a documentary on Neflix on January 1st 2013, “Forks over Knives”. I require all members to watch this documentary. Most documentaries are available on subscriptions sites like Netflix or Amazon Prime or on YouTube. Some are free and others you may have to rent. Here is a list of 11 documentaries I recommend. You can watch them at your convenience but please watch Forks over Knives ASAP.\n1. Forks over Knives\n2. Forks over Knives: Extended Interviews\n3. What the Health\n4. Fat Sick and Nearly Dead\n5. Super juice Me\n6. Death By Medicine by Garry Null.\n7. The Game Changers.\n8. Eating\n9. ⁠From Food to Freedom\n10. Hungry for Change\n11.

relates to how we fertilize that it more relates to how we fertilize that how we promote those cancer cells to how we promote those cancer cells to how we promote those cancer cells to grow over time grow over time grow over time that's where nutrition comes into play that's where nutrition comes into play that's where nutrition comes into play nutrition comes into play back here too nutrition comes into play back here too nutrition comes into play back here too but it's particularly prominent during but it's particularly prominent during but it's particularly prominent during this phase this phase this phase and animal protein and animal protein and animal protein animal protein as we start doing the animal protein as we start doing the animal protein as we start doing the research research research which are experimentally we could turn which are experimentally we could turn which are experimentally we could turn on the growth of these cells they go on the growth of these cells they go on the growth of these cells they go much more rapidly much more rapidly much more rapidly when they were fed animal protein when they were fed animal protein when they were fed animal protein [Music] [Music] [Music] as we started exploring these other as we started exploring these other as we started exploring these other questions we for example worked with questions we for example worked with questions we for example worked with Vader carotene Vader carotene Vader carotene as Pro as the thing that leads to as Pro as the thing that leads to as Pro as the thing that leads to vitamin A we are working somewhat with vitamin A we are working somewhat with vitamin A we are working somewhat with fat fat fat we were working with other antioxidants we were working with other antioxidants we were working with other antioxidants working with other cancer systems working with other cancer systems working with other cancer systems not nearly as extensively as we did with not nearly as extensively as we did with not nearly as extensively as we did with the protein liver cancer thing the protein liver cancer thing the protein liver cancer thing but as we started exploring these but as we started exploring these but as we started exploring these relationships and as some information relationships and as some information relationships and as some information like this was also appearing in the like this was also appearing in the like this was also appearing in the Research Laboratories of others it Research Laboratories of others it Research Laboratories of others it seemed that there was seemed that there was seemed that there was uh that the nutrients that are typically uh that the nutrients that are typically uh that the nutrients that are typically found in plants tended to prevent found in plants tended to prevent found in plants tended to prevent cancers of different kinds cancers of different kinds cancers of different kinds and the nutrients typically found in and the nutrients typically found in and the nutrients typically found in animal fruits tended to promote cancer animal fruits tended to promote cancer animal fruits tended to promote cancer there was some evidence at that time there was some evidence at that time there was some evidence at that time that in comparing populations for that in comparing populations for that in comparing populations for example there was a little bit of example there was a little bit of example there was a little bit of evidence emerging that people consuming evidence emerging that people consuming evidence emerging that people consuming more of the plant-based foods low in fat more of the plant-based foods low in fat more of the plant-based foods low in fat high in fiber there's another issue seem to be associated with lower Rich seem to be associated with lower Rich cancer cancer cancer so there was kind of that stuff I do is so there was kind of that stuff I do is so there was kind of that stuff I do is kind of creeping in at the same time we kind of creeping in at the same time we kind of creeping in at the same time we were doing our research were doing our research were doing our research and seeing this split like this and seeing this split like this and seeing this split like this which tended to which tended to which tended to sort of catalyze more interest I guess sort of catalyze more interest I guess sort of catalyze more interest I guess in the idea that when we use plant in the idea that when we use plant in the idea that when we use plant proteins we didn't turn on cancer we use proteins we didn't turn on cancer we use proteins we didn't turn on cancer we use animal protein we did animal protein we did animal protein we did [Music] [Music] [Music]

that ensure everybody getting up that ensure everybody getting up that nutrient nutrient nutrient um they said let's make a range um they said let's make a range um they said let's make a range so they made a range within which so they made a range within which so they made a range within which it was safe and we would therefore not it was safe and we would therefore not it was safe and we would therefore not get the diseases that we were accustomed get the diseases that we were accustomed get the diseases that we were accustomed to getting to getting to getting so protein for example so protein for example so protein for example went from 10 percent more or less for went from 10 percent more or less for went from 10 percent more or less for the RDA they said we could go all the the RDA they said we could go all the the RDA they said we could go all the way up to 35 percent way up to 35 percent way up to 35 percent this is Ludacris this is Ludacris this is Ludacris if we go from 10 to 20 we get into if we go from 10 to 20 we get into if we go from 10 to 20 we get into property a heart disease cancer they property a heart disease cancer they property a heart disease

carbohydrate they said 25 of our calories could come from sugar and they calories could come from sugar and they calories could come from sugar and they meant free sugar and they were talking meant free sugar and they were talking meant free sugar and they were talking about pastries and candies they said so about pastries and candies they said so about pastries and candies they said so went back to the nutrient composition went back to the nutrient composition went back to the nutrient composition table got a bunch of foods determining table got a bunch of foods determining table got a bunch of foods determining the nutrient content and put together a the nutrient content and put together a the nutrient content and put together a menu plan menu plan menu plan in the manual plan meant we could live in the manual plan meant we could live in the manual plan meant we could live the day away you know having some fruit the day away you know having some fruit the day away you know having some fruit loops and pizza and loops and pizza and loops and pizza and you know high fat foods and candies and you know high fat foods and candies and you know high fat foods and candies and so forth so forth so forth and so that was the standard they told and so that was the standard they told and so that was the standard they told us we could live by that strongly favors us we could live by that strongly favors us we could live by that strongly favors the dairy industry and the meat industry the dairy industry and the meat industry the dairy industry and the meat industry the animal Foods industry the indoor the animal Foods industry the indoor the animal Foods industry the indoor processed foods Industries this favors processed foods Industries this favors processed foods Industries this favors them them them give some advantage give some advantage give some advantage thank you thank you thank you the incidence of bone fractures in our the incidence of bone fractures in our the incidence of bone fractures in our society society society is generally a reflection of is generally a reflection of is generally a reflection of osteoporosis risk osteoporosis risk osteoporosis risk and what has been found and has been and what has been found and has been and what has been found and has been known for some time actually known for some time actually known for some time actually is that the higher the consumption of is that the higher the consumption of is that the higher the consumption of animal protein in different countries animal protein in different countries animal protein in different countries the higher is the rate of bone fractures the higher is the rate of bone fractures the higher is the rate of bone fractures and interestingly and interestingly and interestingly there's also published evidence 20 25 there's also published evidence 20 25 there's also published evidence 20 25 years ago now or more years ago now or more years ago now or more showing that the higher the calcium showing that the higher the calcium showing that the higher the calcium intake intake intake the higher the rate of osteoporosis the higher the rate of osteoporosis the higher the rate of osteoporosis so we can ask the question where do we so we can ask the question where do we so we can ask the question where do we get our extra calcium and protein from get our extra calcium and protein from get our extra calcium and protein from Dairy Dairy Dairy and so in fact the higher the dairy and so in fact the higher the dairy and so in fact the higher the dairy consumption consumption consumption the higher the rate of osteoporosis the higher the rate of osteoporosis the higher the rate of osteoporosis exactly the opposite of what the dairy exactly the opposite of what the dairy exactly the opposite of what the dairy industry has been telling us for so long industry has been telling us for so long industry has been telling us for so long one of the primary mechanisms for that one of the primary mechanisms for that one of the primary mechanisms for that is the animal protein tends to create an is the animal protein tends to create an is the animal protein tends to create an acid-like condition in the body called acid-like condition in the body called acid-like condition in the body called metabolic acidosis metabolic acidosis metabolic acidosis and there's even a slight shift in the and there's even a slight shift in the and there's even a slight shift in the acidity of the body acidity of the body acidity of the body can impair or change or alter certain can impair or change or alter certain can impair or change or alter certain keyisms keyisms keyisms and other properties to sew a little bit and other properties to sew a little bit and other properties to sew a little bit of acid body doesn't like it what it of acid body doesn't like it what it of acid body doesn't like it what it does it draws on the most readily does it draws on the most readily does it draws on the most readily available buffer name and calcium available buffer name and calcium available buffer name and calcium in the bones in the bones in the bones pulls that out of the bones to pulls that out of the bones to pulls that out of the bones to neutralize the acid in the body neutralize the acid in the body neutralize the acid in the body and that compromised bone health and that compromised bone health and that compromised bone health all right when we take the fat out of the milk the when we take the fat out of the milk the protein protein protein becomes a larger proportion of the total becomes a larger proportion of the total becomes a larger proportion of the total so they become higher in protein lower so they become higher in protein lower so they become higher in protein lower in fat in fat in fat and when we compare these high protein and when we compare these high protein and when we compare these high protein low-fat milk products for example with low-fat milk products for example with low-fat milk products for example with prostate cancer the relationship is as prostate cancer the relationship is as prostate cancer the relationship is as strong as it is for cigarette smoking strong as it is for cigarette smoking strong as it is for cigarette smoking lung cancer the protein in the milk is lung cancer the protein in the milk is lung cancer the protein in the milk is what matters what matters what matters more than anything more than anything more than anything and so by taking out the fat you're just and so by taking out the fat you're just and so by taking out the fat you're just making it worse making it worse making it worse [Music] the observational study like we did in the observational study like we did in China China China um is criticized because you can't make um is criticized because you can't make um is criticized because you can't make a conclusive statements or does improve a conclusive statements or does improve a conclusive statements or does improve cause and effect as we'd like to say cause and effect as we'd like to say cause and effect as we'd like to say that's true if the hypothesis in the that's true if the hypothesis in the that's true if the hypothesis in the beginning is focused on single things beginning is focused on single things beginning is focused on single things affecting single things that's true affecting single things that's true affecting single things that's true in other words you've got a population in other words you've got a population in other words you've got a population here doing all their eating and this and here doing all their eating and this and here doing all their eating and this and that and everything else over here that and everything else over here that and everything else over here you've got all kinds of Health outcomes you've got all kinds of Health outcomes you've got all kinds of Health outcomes and so the way that statistics are and so the way that statistics are and so the way that statistics are organized is to search for the one thing organized is to search for the one thing organized is to search for the one thing you know that might be related to this you know that might be related to this you know that might be related to this kind of outcome kind of outcome kind of outcome and so in essence yes those and so in essence yes those and so in essence yes those observational studies are limited observational studies are limited observational studies are limited that I I wrote this in fact in our that I I wrote this in fact in our that I I wrote this in fact in our challenge that we knew that well I challenge that we knew that well I challenge that we knew that well I taught this kind of thing that that's taught this kind of thing that that's taught this kind of thing that that's very classical however in the kind of very classical however in the kind of very classical however in the kind of study that we were doing we had all study that we were doing we had all study that we were doing we had all these things we could measure all the these things we could measure all the these things we could measure all the things in the blood and all the other things in the blood and all the other things in the blood and all the other things in the body or that's being things in the body or that's being things in the body or that's being consumed and all the outcomes a whole consumed and all the outcomes a whole consumed and all the outcomes a whole bunch of things here A whole bunch of bunch of things here A whole bunch of bunch of things here A whole bunch of things here looking for the context things here looking for the context things here looking for the context essentially and then when we frame the essentially and then when we frame the essentially and then when we frame the question from a broad base no we don't question from a broad base no we don't question from a broad base no we don't fight we don't frame a hypothesis on the fight we don't frame a hypothesis on the fight we don't frame a hypothesis on the effect of one thing effect of one thing effect of one thing we frame a hypothesis on the base of a we frame a hypothesis on the base of a we frame a hypothesis on the base of a grand sort of dietary plan grand sort of dietary plan grand sort of dietary plan that we can examine in a study like this that we can examine in a study like this that we can examine in a study like this in multiple different ways in multiple different ways in multiple different ways so if I say a plant-based diet is good so if I say a plant-based diet is good so if I say a plant-based diet is good in this sense well we got maybe 100 in this sense well we got maybe 100 in this sense well we got maybe 100 different ways different ways different ways of comparing things with social of comparing things with social of comparing things with social plant-based diet plant-based diet plant-based diet and 100 different ways to see how those and 100 different ways to see how those and 100 different ways to see how those things behave in the body compared to things behave in the body compared to things behave in the body compared to the things on the outcome the things on the outcome the things on the outcome so now our hypothesis broadened like so now our hypothesis broadened like so now our hypothesis broadened like this this this and if we find that all these individual and if we find that all these individual and if we find that all these individual relationships will point in the same relationships will point in the same relationships will point in the same direction direction direction and then we can ask ourselves how come and then we can ask ourselves how come and then we can ask ourselves how come 19 out of 20 of these things said the 19 out of 20 of these things said the 19 out of 20 of these things said the same thing same thing same thing that's that's virtual proof of cause and that's that's virtual proof of cause and that's that's virtual proof of cause and effect effect effect [Music] [Music] [Music] The China Study gave us some very The China Study gave us some very The China Study gave us some very important information but standing alone important information but standing alone important information but standing alone it would not have allowed me it would not have allowed me it would not have allowed me in order to sit here and say the things in order to sit here and say the things in order to sit

did have some limitations this one study for one for one thing this one study for one for one thing this one study for one for one thing and and and but when when that information is put in but when when that information is put in but when when that information is put in the context the context the context of all the other sort of nutrition of all the other sort of nutrition of all the other sort

in a conversation with them they were in a conversation with them they were released released released full-time back to their expert full-time back to their expert full-time back to their expert cardiologists with the understanding cardiologists with the understanding cardiologists with the understanding that I would peek in from time to time that I would peek in from time to time that I would peek in from time to time just to see how they were doing because just to see how they were doing because just to see how they were doing because they in essence sort of became my they in essence sort of became my they in essence sort of became my control group I mean here was a study control group I mean here was a study control group I mean here was a study that eventually went on Beyond 20 years that eventually went on Beyond 20 years that eventually went on Beyond 20 years and they are left within 12 months and they are left within 12 months and they are left within 12 months uh so that meant that the the other uh so that meant that the the other uh so that meant that the the other uh uh uh the other 18. the other 18. the other 18. who sort of stuck with the program who sort of stuck with the program who sort of stuck with the program um um um I wrote them up again at 12 years and I wrote them up again at 12 years and I wrote them up again at 12 years and that was pretty significant because that was pretty significant because that was pretty significant because what we found at 12 years was what we found at 12 years was what we found at 12 years was that first of all among those six who that first of all among those six who that first of all among those six who had left the study had left the study had left the study uh uh uh two of those had died and the other four two of those had died and the other four two of those had died and the other four had had another bypass operation had had another bypass operation had had another bypass operation the 18 had stayed with the study we the 18 had stayed with the study we the 18 had stayed with the study we decided we'd look at decided we'd look at decided we'd look at how many how many how many coronary or heart events had they had in coronary or heart events had they had in coronary or heart events had they had in the eight years prior to the study while the eight years prior to the study while the eight years prior to the study while they were in the hands of expert they were in the hands of expert they were in the hands of expert cardiologists cardiologists cardiologists and those 18 patients had 49 coronary and those 18 patients had 49 coronary and those 18 patients had 49 coronary events either a heart attack or events either a heart attack or events either a heart attack or additional need for more intervention or additional need for more intervention or additional need for more intervention or worsening symptoms or worsening worsening symptoms or worsening worsening symptoms or

new heart attacks new heart attacks and that has been shown it with multiple and that has been shown it with multiple and that has been shown it with multiple studies both of these procedures usually studies both of these procedures usually studies both of these procedures usually are are are utilized when you have a very very major utilized when you have a very very major utilized when you have a

10 percent of heart attacks come from those percent of heart attacks come from those percent of heart attacks come from those but let's say you go ahead but let's say you go ahead but let's say you go

another one by stents one by bypass and another one by stents but but but we know from studies with ultrasound and we know from studies with ultrasound and we know from studies with ultrasound and so forth that patients so forth that patients so forth that patients in addition to having that major plaque in addition to having that major plaque in addition to having that major plaque have hundreds

don't eat bread because that'll turn don't eat bread because that'll turn into sugar well we reasoned that in into sugar well we reasoned that in into sugar well we reasoned that in countries like China Japan Thailand countries like China Japan Thailand countries like China Japan Thailand Cambodia where it's a very high Cambodia where it's a very high Cambodia where it's a very high carbohydrate diet but a very low fat carbohydrate diet but a very low fat carbohydrate diet but a very low fat diet diet diet given that they have the lowest diabetes given that they have the lowest diabetes given that they have the lowest diabetes rates in the world we thought it's not rates in the world we thought it's not rates in the world we thought it's not carbohydrate the problem has to do with carbohydrate the problem has to do with carbohydrate the problem has to do with fat the fatty foods meat chicken fat fat the fatty foods meat chicken fat fat the fatty foods meat chicken fat oily Foods those fats get into the cells oily Foods those fats get into the cells oily Foods those fats get into the cells that causes that insulin resistance so that causes that insulin resistance so that causes that insulin resistance so the diet should be getting the fat out the diet should be getting the fat out the diet should be getting the fat out of the cell so insulin can work again of the

of complications reduce the likelihood of complications reduce the likelihood of complications but it won't get them off their insulin but it won't get them off their insulin but it won't get them off their insulin now having said that there are now having said that there are now having said that there are researchers who now believe that one of researchers who now believe that one of researchers who now believe that one of the big triggers for type 1 diabetes is the big triggers for type 1 diabetes is the big triggers for type 1 diabetes is dairy products it turns out that dairy products it turns out that dairy products it turns out that proteins in cow's milk cause the body proteins in cow's milk cause the body proteins in cow's milk cause the body the body recognizes them as foreign the body recognizes them as foreign the body recognizes them as foreign proteins the body makes antibodies to proteins the body makes antibodies to proteins the body makes antibodies to destroy them those same antibodies then destroy them those same antibodies then destroy them those same antibodies then destroy the insulin producing cells in destroy the insulin producing cells in destroy the

nailing down whether if kids now that's nailing down whether if kids are breastfed and they are not given a are breastfed and they are not given a are breastfed and they are not given a cow's milk cow's milk cow's milk protein at all during infancy that we protein at all during infancy that we protein at all during infancy that we might be able to reduce the risk of type might be able to reduce the risk of type might be able to reduce the risk of type 1 diabetes the evidence so far says 1 diabetes the evidence so far says 1 diabetes the evidence so far says that's exactly right that's exactly right that's exactly right [Music] [Music] [Music] there have been a couple of tremendous there have been a couple of tremendous there have been a couple of tremendous studies on breast cancer survival I'm studies on breast cancer survival I'm studies on breast cancer survival I'm talking about a woman has been diagnosed talking about a woman has been diagnosed talking about a woman has been diagnosed already she wants to know what can I eat already she wants to know what can I eat already she wants to know what can I eat in order to prevent the cancer from in order to prevent the cancer from in order to prevent the cancer from coming back and one study called the coming back and one study called the coming back and one study called the women's intervention nutrition study women's intervention nutrition study women's intervention nutrition study wins study showed that if women cut the wins study showed that if women cut the wins study showed that if women cut the fat from their diet their likelihood of fat from their diet their likelihood of fat from their diet their likelihood of survival is greatly increased the survival is greatly increased the survival is greatly increased the likelihood of having a recurrence likelihood of having a recurrence likelihood of having a recurrence greatly decreased a second study showed greatly decreased a second study showed greatly decreased a second study showed that if you also add vegetables and that if you also add vegetables and that if you also add vegetables and fruits and physical activity to the diet fruits and physical activity to the diet fruits and physical activity to the diet you're going to do better as well so my you're going to do better as well so my you're going to do better as well so my answer is let's put it all together cut answer is let's put it all together cut answer is let's put it all together cut the fat boost the vegetables and fruits the fat boost the vegetables and fruits the fat boost the vegetables and fruits lace up our sneakers let's see what we lace up our sneakers let's see what we lace up our sneakers let's see what we can do in both of those cases that I can do in both of those cases that I can do in both of those cases that I mentioned the researchers have shown mentioned the researchers have shown mentioned the researchers have shown that survival is measurably increased that survival is measurably increased that survival is measurably increased and it's increased a lot a woman who's and it's increased a lot a woman who's and it's increased a lot a woman who's eating a lot of vegetables and fruits eating a lot of vegetables and fruits eating a lot of vegetables and fruits and is physically active her risk of and is physically active her risk of and is physically active her risk of dying over cancer is half that of a dying over cancer is half that of a dying over cancer is half that of a woman who is either skipping the woman who is either skipping the woman who is either skipping the vegetables and fruits or skipping the vegetables and fruits or skipping the vegetables and fruits or skipping the exercise so it's powerful

the risk of heart fish does not reduce the risk of heart disease disease disease foreign showed and published in 1991 and other showed and published in 1991 and other research articles is if you take people research articles is if you take people research articles is if you take people with multiple sclerosis you put them on with multiple sclerosis you put them on with multiple sclerosis you put them on a low animal diet that over a 35-year a low animal diet that over a 35-year a low animal diet that over a 35-year period of time less than five percent of period of time less than five percent

leaving to their own means and we're leaving to their own means and we're going to see what happens to them over going to see what happens to them over going to see what happens to them over six months 12 months 24 months and I six months 12 months 24 months and I six months 12 months 24 months and I believe we'll show the same thing Dr believe we'll show the same thing Dr believe we'll show the same thing Dr Swank showed and that is you stop this Swank showed and that is you stop this Swank showed and that is you stop this disease with a healthy diet disease with a healthy diet disease with a healthy diet so it's it's exciting so and people ask so it's it's exciting so and people ask so it's it's exciting so and people ask me they say Well why'd you take all that me they say Well why'd you take all that me they say Well why'd you take all that money and do it you know treat multiple money and do it you know treat multiple money and do it you know treat multiple sclerosis why don't you treat something sclerosis why don't you treat something sclerosis why don't you treat something like heart disease or constipation or like heart disease or constipation or like heart disease or constipation or something like that and my answer is something like that and my answer is something like that and my answer is is I wanted to take the biggest rock I is I wanted to take the biggest rock I is I wanted to take the biggest rock I could find and throw it at the biggest could find and throw it at the biggest could find and throw it at the biggest picture window in town because people picture window in town because people picture window in town because people are going to step back and they're going are going to step back and they're going are going to step back and they're going to say whoa if you can stop that disease to say whoa if you can stop that disease to say whoa if you can stop that disease that much of a mystery to science if you that much of a mystery to science if you that much of a mystery to science if you can stop that with food you could can stop that with food you could can stop that with food you could probably stop anything probably stop anything probably stop anything [Music] [Music] [Music] say uh you got 100 subjects and without say uh you got 100 subjects and without say uh you got 100 subjects and without treatment to get bad so you have a treatment to get bad so you have a treatment to get bad so you have a stroke and with treatment only one has a stroke and with treatment only one has a stroke and with treatment only one has a stroke well that's one in a hundred stroke well that's one in a hundred stroke well that's one in a hundred versus two and a hundred which is not versus two and a hundred which is not versus two and a hundred which is not much difference but if you just take a much difference but if you just take a much difference but if you just take a look at the one and the two that's a 50 look at the one and the two that's a 50 look at the one and the two that's a 50 reduction and that's relative benefit so reduction and that's relative benefit so reduction and that's relative benefit so that's the way it's been reported to that's the way it's been reported to that's the way it's been reported to patients so you go in and see your patients so you go in and see your patients so you go in and see your doctor uh and you have thinning bones so doctor uh and you have thinning bones so doctor uh and you have thinning bones so to speak osteoporosis the doctor says to speak osteoporosis the doctor says to speak osteoporosis the doctor says you know if if you don't take this drug you know if if you don't take this drug you know if if you don't take this drug this uh bisphosphonate this uh bisphosphonate this uh bisphosphonate drug medication Fosamax actinel Boniva drug medication Fosamax actinel Boniva drug medication Fosamax actinel Boniva those kinds of things your your risk of those kinds of things your your risk of those kinds of things your your risk of having a fracture is uh is doubled you having a fracture is uh is doubled you having a fracture is uh is doubled you can cut your risk of fracture nearly in can cut your risk of fracture nearly in can cut your risk of fracture nearly in half by taking these drugs half by taking these drugs half by taking these drugs well that's the relative benefit but the well that's the relative benefit but the well that's the relative benefit but the absolute benefit is only 1.7 percent absolute benefit is only 1.7 percent absolute benefit is only 1.7 percent over over uh four years of time see so over over uh four years of time see so over over uh four years of time see so they lie they lie they lie [Music] [Music] [Music] the

that creatures do and that is they seek Pleasant things and that is they seek Pleasant things and that is they seek Pleasant things for what we call Pleasure and primarily for what we call Pleasure and primarily for what we call Pleasure and primarily two things are the cause of that and two things are the cause of that and two things are the cause of that and those two things are food and sex so in those two things are food and sex so in those two things are food and sex so in the case of a great white shark it's the case of a great white shark it's the case of a great white shark it's basically got a neon sign flashing basically got a neon sign flashing basically got a neon sign flashing across its forehead saying food sex food across its forehead saying food sex food across its forehead saying food sex food sex food sex that's what it does unless sex food sex that's what it does unless sex food sex that's what it does unless it's a male then it says sex food sex it's a male then it says sex food sex it's a male then it says sex food sex food but it's pretty much the same thing food but it's pretty much the same thing food but it's pretty much the same thing the um uh it also needs to avoid pain so the um uh it also needs to avoid pain so the um uh it also needs to avoid pain so it has signals from its body to tell it it has signals from its body to tell it it has signals from its body to tell it when there's been a relationship between when there's been a relationship between when there's been a relationship between itself and its environment which is not itself and its environment which is not itself and its environment which is not good so for example if the water's a good so for example if the water's a good so for example if the water's a little too dirty it'll move to where little too dirty it'll move to where little too dirty it'll move to where it's cleaner if it's a little too cold it's cleaner if it's a little too cold it's cleaner if

fire Coral it'll creates itself on some fire Coral it'll move away from that area of the ocean it move away from that area of the ocean it move away from that area of the ocean it has a lot of very sophisticated methods has a lot of very sophisticated methods has a lot of very sophisticated methods to tell it when it's relationship to the to tell it when it's relationship to the to tell it when it's relationship to the environment is not good that's pain so environment is not good that's pain so environment is not good that's pain so this thing is seeking pleasure and this thing is seeking pleasure and this thing is seeking pleasure and avoiding pain it hasn't been until avoiding pain it hasn't been until avoiding pain it hasn't been until comparatively recently that we comparatively recently that we comparatively recently that we understood there was a third major understood there was a third major understood there was a third major component of motivation that helps us component of motivation that helps us component of motivation that helps us understand things all we had to do is understand things all we had to do is understand things all we had to do is ask the question right uh if that great ask the question right uh if that great ask the question right uh if that great white shark is hungry and there's a tuna white shark is hungry and there's a tuna white shark is hungry and there's a tuna flopping in the water 20 feet away and flopping in the water 20 feet away and flopping in the water 20 feet away and another tuna flopping in the water 40 another tuna flopping in the water 40 another tuna flopping in the water 40 feet away which one does it go for you feet away which one does it go for you feet away which one does it go for you know every grade school kid that I ask know every grade school kid that I ask know every grade school kid that I ask this question knows here she'll say well this question knows here she'll say well this question knows here she'll say well 20 feet away the closer one and then we 20 feet away the closer one and then we 20 feet away the closer one and then we just ask why and the answer is well it's just ask why and the answer is well it's just ask why and the answer is well it's easier and that's exactly what it is and easier and that's exactly what it is and easier and that's exactly what it is and more formally what this is is the law of more formally what this is is the law of more formally what this is is the law of energy a conservation that that animals energy a conservation that that animals energy a conservation that that animals are a must by nature of how they're are a must by nature of how they're are a must by nature of how they're built chemically they have to figure out built chemically they have to figure out built chemically they have to figure out how to get a lot of chemicals for a how to get a lot of chemicals for a how to get a lot of chemicals for a little chemical output basically little little chemical output basically little little chemical output basically little chemical businesses is what a life form chemical businesses is what a life form chemical businesses is what a life form is and so it has to obey this law that is and so it has to obey this law that is and so it has to obey this law that says get the most for the least which says get the most for the least which says get the most for the least which means conserve its energy so pleasure means conserve its energy so pleasure means conserve its energy so pleasure seeking pain avoidance and energy seeking pain avoidance and energy seeking pain avoidance and energy conservation are what we call the conservation are what we call the conservation are what we call the motivational Triad and that really sums motivational Triad and that really sums motivational Triad and that really sums up animal behavior whether we're talking up animal behavior whether we're talking up animal behavior whether we're talking about a paramecium out or a microscope about a paramecium out or a microscope about a paramecium out or a microscope or a great white shark or a great white shark or a great white shark [Music] [Music] [Music] what the pleasure trap is is an what the pleasure trap is is an what the pleasure trap is is an interaction between our Natural interaction between our Natural interaction between our Natural Instincts which are trying to tell us Instincts which are trying to tell us Instincts which are trying to tell us the right thing to do and some kind of the right thing to do and some kind of the right thing to do and some kind of artificial modern stimulation that is artificial modern stimulation that is artificial modern stimulation that is piggybacking or hijacking that process piggybacking or hijacking that process piggybacking or hijacking that process so the classic example of the pleasure so the classic example of the pleasure so the classic example of the pleasure trap would be drugs and drug addiction trap would be drugs and drug addiction trap would be drugs and drug addiction or alcohol addiction these are ways that or alcohol addiction these are ways that or alcohol addiction these are ways that that we have fine found in our great that we have fine found in our great that we have fine found in our great human Ingenuity we've found chemicals human Ingenuity we've found chemicals human Ingenuity we've found chemicals that if we put them in in us they will that if we put them in in us they will that if we put them in

success good this is a great biological success this is uh this is obviously a dangerous this is uh this is obviously a dangerous this is uh this is obviously a dangerous stuff and it's a problem and there's stuff and it's a problem and there's stuff and it's a problem and there's really no way to get around uh the issue really no way to get around uh the issue really no way to get around uh the issue that we're susceptible to these things that we're susceptible to these things that we're susceptible to these things our pleasure centers and our sensitivity our pleasure centers and our sensitivity our pleasure centers and our sensitivity to certain kinds of stimulation is to certain kinds of stimulation is to certain kinds of stimulation is natural uh we need it it's critical natural uh we need it it's critical natural uh we need it it's critical guidance for us it's in our internal guidance for us it's in our internal guidance for us it's in our internal compass that internal Compass can be led compass that internal Compass can be led compass that internal Compass can be led astray by artificial things that human astray by artificial things that human astray by artificial things that human beings have created beings have created beings have created you see this not just in people but you you see this not just in people but you you see this not just in people but you see it also in animal life and it's very see it also in animal life and it's very see it also in animal life and it's very easy to see it so a moth on your back easy to see it so a moth on your back easy to see it so a moth on your back porch that spends its night running into porch that spends its night running into porch that spends its night running into your your light your porch light and your your light your porch light and your your light your porch light and gets exhausted and disoriented in the gets exhausted and disoriented in the gets exhausted and disoriented in the process that's a moth that is in the process that's a moth that is in the process that's a moth that is in the pleasure trap it's being goaded to fly pleasure trap it's being goaded to fly pleasure trap it's being goaded to fly to the light because they're designed to to the light because they're designed to to the light because they're designed to fly to the moon in night and by doing so fly to the moon in night and by doing so fly to the moon in night and by doing so they fly up they can't get to the moon they fly up they can't get to the moon they fly up they can't get to the moon and then they get up above The Fray and and then they get up above The Fray and and then they get up above The Fray and they can get chemical sensitivity to they can get chemical sensitivity to they can get chemical sensitivity to mates or food and then they fly down to mates or food and then they fly down to mates or food and then they fly down to those mates or food and they can then those mates or food and they can then those mates or food and they can then reverse this process and use the moon as reverse this process and use the moon as reverse this process and use the moon as a compass to fly back to where it is a compass to fly back to where it is a compass to fly back to where it is that they came from that they came from that they came from foreign typically has about 300 calories a pound typically has about 300 calories a pound and so a given Apple if it's half a and so a given Apple if it's half a and so a given Apple if it's half a pound it might have 150 calories in it pound it might have 150 calories in it pound it might have 150 calories in it but it's a big apple and so if it took but it's a big apple and so if it took but it's a big apple and so if it took 15 bites to eat that Apple it would be 15 bites to eat that Apple it would be 15 bites to eat that Apple it would be about 10 calories in a bite about 10 calories in a bite about 10 calories in a bite so you you can taste that 10 calories if so you you can taste that 10 calories if so you you can taste that 10 calories if it was a if it was not a very ripe Apple it was a if it was not a very ripe Apple it was a if it was not a very ripe Apple you wouldn't be too impressed with it you wouldn't be too impressed with it you wouldn't be too impressed with it you really wouldn't want to eat it but you really wouldn't want to eat it but you really wouldn't want to eat it but if you came out here a little while if you came out here a little while if you came out here a little while later and that Apple were a little later and that Apple were a little later and that Apple were a little richer just a little bit higher sugar richer just a little bit higher sugar richer just a little bit higher sugar content it might be a 330 calorie pound content it might be a 330 calorie pound content it might be a 330 calorie pound Apple so that Apple might be Apple so that Apple might be Apple so that Apple might be just 10 percent more concentrated so just 10 percent more concentrated so just 10 percent more concentrated so that bite that you had wouldn't be 10 that bite that you had wouldn't be 10 that bite that you had wouldn't be 10 calories it would be 11. and you would calories it would be 11. and you would calories it would be 11. and you would be much more motivated to eat that Apple be much more motivated to eat that Apple be much more motivated to eat that Apple you'd like it a lot so your taste you'd like it a lot so your taste you'd like it a lot so your taste sensitivity is so sensitive that it can sensitivity is so sensitive that it can sensitivity is so sensitive that it can easily pick up the difference in one easily pick up the difference in one easily pick up the difference in one calorie in a bite calorie in a bite calorie in a bite now if that's true and the reason why now if that's true and the reason why now if that's true and the reason why that's true is because your your natural that's true is because your your natural that's true is because your your natural history said 10 calories in a bite too history said 10 calories in a bite too history said 10 calories in a bite too sour not enough sugar content not good sour not enough sugar content not good sour not enough sugar content not good enough not worth eating find something enough not worth eating find something enough not worth eating find something better better better and so keep picking pick a different one and so keep picking pick a different one and so keep picking pick a different one pick one that's a little different in pick one that's a little different in pick one that's a little different in color and so we pick one that's a little color and so we pick one that's a little color and so we pick one that's a little different in color and take a bite 11 different in color and take a bite 11 different in color and take a bite 11 calories in that bite and you like it calories in that bite and you like it calories in that bite and you like it and you're motivated to continue if and you're motivated to continue if and you're motivated to continue if we're motivated behind the difference we're motivated behind the difference we're motivated behind the difference between one calorie and a bite then you between one calorie and a bite then you between one calorie and a bite then you can imagine that when I have a chocolate can imagine that when I have a chocolate can imagine that when I have a chocolate Apple that's not 300 calories a pound or Apple that's not 300 calories a pound or Apple that's not 300 calories a pound or 330 calories a pound it's 3 000 calories 330 calories a pound it's 3 000 calories 330 calories a pound it's 3 000 calories a pound it's 10 times the caloric a pound it's 10 times the caloric a pound it's 10 times the caloric density 10 times the energy per bite so density 10 times the energy per bite so density 10 times the energy per bite so now we're not talking about 10 calories now we're not talking about 10 calories now we're not talking about 10 calories or 11 calories we're talking about 100 or 11 calories we're talking about 100 or 11 calories we're talking about 100 calories calories calories so you can only imagine what happens to so you can only imagine what happens to so you can only imagine what happens to the neurochemistry if it's excited about the neurochemistry if it's excited about the neurochemistry if it's excited about the difference between 10 calories and the difference between 10 calories and the difference between 10 calories and 11 calories what happens when we go from 11 calories what happens when we go from 11 calories what happens when we go from 11 calories to on recovers and that's 11 calories to on recovers and that's 11 calories to on recovers and that's how the Trap is set what we've simply how the Trap is set what we've simply how the Trap is set what we've simply done to the food is this we've removed done to the food is this we've removed done to the food is this we've removed the fiber we've removed the water we've the fiber we've removed the water we've the fiber we've removed the water we've removed the minerals we've done removed the minerals we've done removed the minerals we've done everything that we can to hyper everything that we can to hyper everything that

amount of food that we've eaten is consistent with our that we've eaten is consistent with our that we've eaten is consistent with our personal size and so it's simply how personal size and so it's simply how personal size and so it's simply how stretched out is your stomach when you stretched out is your stomach when you stretched out is your stomach when you eat but that's not enough because if eat but that's not enough because if eat but that's not enough because if nature relied just on that we'd have a nature relied just on that we'd have a nature relied just on that we'd have a

        "content": "(bird singing) (gentle music) - So Washington is where, of course, I'm concerned personally, but later on, I got involved in quite a lot of policy work, developing help with a developed national policy. And that was a lesson. It was a lesson for me. I could see firsthand, I call it subtle power. The public tends not to see it, but it's very, very powerful. And so we need to break through that control, if you will. (audience cheering) - And we had a great response to this film \"PlantPure Nation.\" We have a scene early in the film that I think speaks to a feeling that maybe we don't articulate it all the time, but it's a defining characteristic of our time, which is the loss of control and connection. We see a lot of negative imagery coming through our TV screens and our computers, and I think sometimes we feel like our world is spinning out of control. And so there's this sense of hopelessness. But you know what? I wouldn't wanna be alive at any other time in human history because our time is a time that is ripe for revolution. (audience cheering) And by the way, I don't mean a revolution of aggression and one-sidedness. I mean a revolution of love and awareness. I still remember 40 years ago, when my dad told us around the dinner table, he had discovered he could turn cancer on and off in the laboratory simply by using food. My father is Dr. T. Colin Campbell. He's known by millions for his pioneering research on a plant-based diet. - It's very true. If we didn't, if we were eating right, we would need to be selling us Cialis and all this, that Viagra and stuff like that. - [Host] But you're 77, you don't need it, right? - No. (panelist laughs) (audience cheering) - [Nelson] For years, I've watched him struggle against powerful interest to share his research. I'm Nelson Campbell, and this is my wife Kim. She's a plant-based chef and cookbook author. - And it's much more comprehensive. It goes into detail. - In 2014, we took a big step. We wondered, \"Could we help people transition to a plant-based diet in our rural North Carolina community?\" - Everybody pretty much knows everybody. I think that it creates kind of like a sense of family. - [Nelson] We're in the land of barbecue here. - Fried chicken and green beans, but green beans with bacon and butter (laughs) and stuff like that. - [Nelson] We organized several immersion programs providing education in plant-based meals. - Doesn't get better than that, thank you. - [Nelson] We showed that people can dramatically reduce cholesterol, begin healing chronic conditions, and reduce or eliminate many medications in just 10 days. - [Doctor] Your total cholesterol is 150. - Is that accurate? - [Doctor] Yep. - [Companion] Is that thing working? - Is it? You are kidding me. - [Doctor] Uh-uh, Triglycerides are 98. They were 395. - You sure that's accurate? - I've been testing for 26 years. We've tested millions of people, and I've never seen results like this. - [Nelson] Then we took a bigger step, this time in a neighboring state. With our support, state representative Tom Riner submitted legislation to communicate the health benefits of a plant-based diet across Kentucky, starting in its most under-resourced communities where our healthcare crisis is most severe. - [House Leader] Have all members voted? Any member wished to change or explain his or her vote. If all members voted work, we'll take the roll. Roll call machine showing 34 members voting yay. 44 members voting nay. House floor amendment number one is defeated. - [Nelson] Opposed by powerful interests, we failed twice, but instead of walking away quietly, we took our story public in Louisville. - Which leads to another plateau of emotional freedoms. - And when people do this, and they experience the health benefit, you know, they've become overjoyed. But what's interesting is the very next question they ask, the very next thing they say, \"Why haven't I heard this before?\" All of this ended up in a documentary film called \"PlantPure Nation,\" which we released in 2015. Because revolutions can't start without awareness. Our film had an impact. In its ending, we asked people to launch groups called pods to sow seeds of change in their communities. - Oh, yeah. - I'm excited. - [Nelson] People across the US and around the world responded. We then set to work on a larger grassroots strategy, and we're making progress. But in March of 2020, the pandemic hit. - A SARS-like virus, which has infected hundreds in China, has now reached the United States. - [Reporter] Coronavirus. - You think about it, the Coronavirus crisis is changing so fast that these maps can't keep up. The great shutdown of 2020 is underway. - [Reporter] More than 10,000 school closures nationwide affecting nearly 5 million school children from San Jose to Salt Lake to Boston. So-called surge tents, popping up, ER rooms preparing for potential patient overflow. - [Nelson] So many lives upended, including our own. We struggled to keep our organizations afloat and watched as many others suffered worse fates. We wondered though, \"Would the pandemic encourage people in positions of power to share the truth of plant-based nutrition?\" We thought so because early data from Italy showed that 99% of people dying had preexisting medical conditions, mostly from nutritionally-caused chronic diseases. The people in charge advised us to wear masks, wash our hands, and stay apart from one another. - Face masks, these face masks are the most important powerful public health tool we have. - The most important thing that I think overshadows all of that is to wash your hands as frequently as possible. - Social distancing will be with us through the summer to really ensure that we protect one another as we move through these phases. - [Nelson] Unfortunately, they ignored an important, more empowering idea. In our immersion programs, we'd witnessed many people healing themselves of chronic conditions in rural North Carolina, a Cajun community in southwest Louisiana, a farming community on the plains of northern Indiana, in a Dominican neighborhood in New York City. Most of us know that eating right is part of a healthy lifestyle, but we don't often think of food as medicine. Medicine has immediate effects. Healthy eating is for the long haul. But what if food is the real medicine, and what if the pandemic was far worse than it needed to be because of what we eat? We decided to organize another immersion, this time doing something we'd never done before. We would host a live-in immersion in Greensboro, North Carolina where we could ensure 100% compliance with the plant-based meal plan for 10 days. And we decided to focus on individuals with type 2 diabetes. Of the people in the US who died of COVID, nearly 40% had diabetes, mostly type 2 diabetes. Once again, we brought along our cameras. - I was diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure and high cholesterol. And because I had a stroke, I'm still on some blood-thinning medications. My name's Dennis Hadac. I'm from a small town in Arkansas called Mena. I grew up in a household where my father worked in a pork-processing plant. So we had pork six days a week, and I've been a meat eater ever since, and I've been slowly moving away from that. But it wasn't until I walked into the door here, - Hello, welcome. - that I stopped eating meat. - You look like your photo. (laughs) - My doctor said, \"Well, we should get you on some diabetes medication.\" I said, \"Okay, hey, that's gonna work fine, gimme the pill.\" So I added the pill, but it wasn't like I made any substantial lifestyle changes. Three or four years later, I have a different doctor, and he said, \"You know, this oral stuff is not working for you. I'm going to put you on Tresiba. And now I'm in this downward cycle. All of a sudden, it's, okay, 35 units, 40 units, 45 units. Now I'm up to 54 units on a daily basis. And I figured, \"Okay, well, you know? I'm not feeling all that well,\" and I figured if I can move on and get into a plant-based diet, my health will improve, generally speaking, not just getting rid of the diabetes medications, but the overall health will improve. And that's why I'm here. (recruit knocks at the door) - [Nelson] Because of a limited budget, we had only four weeks to recruit. We quickly reached out to diverse communities across the country, and fortunately found six people with type 2 diabetes willing to spend 10 days with us. Two brought their spouses. (recruits chatting indistinctly) - The sodium is actually okay, you'll see. - In my late teens, we started transition, and I didn't really become holy plant-based until my 20s. (recruits chatting indistinctly) - So I have to go through all of this rigamarole of getting a tournament set up in 28 days. - So thank you for coming here for these 10 days. It's a big commitment to go any place for 10 days. We're not gonna do this every time we get together, the filming, but this is our first meeting, so don't be shy. Share your feelings, be yourselves and speak from the heart. And the person who's gonna be helping every day is Ella Stevens. - I work for PlantPure Communities. For this plant-based live-in immersion, I have been coordinating the participants and providing them with a schedule of educational sessions. Then we also have group discussions factored in. It can include presentations with Dr. Laurie Marbas. - So basically what is a whole food? So it's food that's been not processed, refined as little as possible and it's free from additives or artificial flavors. My name is Dr. Laurie Marbas. I'm from Longmont, Colorado. I'm a lifestyle and family medicine physician who's been practicing for about 20 years, and 10 of those years including a whole food plant-based diet. So what are your goals with this immersion? - My goal is to get off insulin. - The medications that you're currently taking, were just the insulin delay? - Yes. - And how many units? - It's about 30 units every night. - You will be having one-on-one patient meetings, and at the end of the 10 days, We will also check in with her and get your blood work done so we can compare with the blood work before the immersion. - So this is the Libre. This is a continuous glucose monitor that you now applied to the back of your upper arm, right there, and what that's gonna allow you to do is actually monitor your blood sugars for a 24-hour basis. So what we're gonna do is we'll learn together your different patterns. If your blood sugar goes up or if it goes down, we'll see what you do overnight. - [Nelson] Participants were enrolled as patients of Dr. Marbas who used diagnostic tools and direct observation to make data-driven decisions. In addition to her support, participants enjoy daily meals prepared by Kim and our close friend Fernando Peralta. - My name is Fernando Peralta. I live in Philadelphia, and I am a trained chef. I went plant-based, I think what triggered it was my father's quadruple bypass, and I was about 30 at the time, and I started looking at my blood indicators, and it wasn't looking good, and having a family history, I thought he was a wake up call. And about at that time, I quit my job in finance, and that's when I went to cooking school. - My name is Kim Campbell, and I live outside of Durham, North Carolina. I met my husband when I was 16, and I met his father Colin, and I was fascinated with all of his research. And so I went on to study nutrition in college. It's always been a hobby, almost an obsession, learning how to cook healthy food. And I've written a couple of cookbooks, and I love education, I love people, and I love watching people heal. - All right, so let's, maybe we'll start with you, John, and just kind of work our way around. - Well, I found out I had stage 4 kidney failure. Hypertension, diabetes. Yeah, I take Trulicity, I think it's 1.75. You just turn the little dial. I mean, that's what the doctor told me. You know, \"Here, take this. Here, take that.\" Kim has been the catalyst for me to come here. She's been on a whole food diet for seven years. - Yep. Well, plant being plant-based has really changed how I feel and how my body is, and, you know, just being married to someone for so long, you wanna be around them for a long time. And I could see his health was really deteriorating. Yeah, so it was hard for me. It's hard for me to watch this happen to him and know that it can be different. And we've been married 41 years, and I'd like him to be a ring for. - Just poor taste in men. (group laughs) The military health system, if you can navigate it and get in and keep up on it, it can be very, very, very good. But it kind of sort of seems like what I've learned here is they maintain your illness versus curing it. Because, you know, diabetes, you got it, you're always gonna have it. Hypertension, yeah, you got it, everything, gonna have it. Yeah, you got PTSD. And my health has kind of been deteriorating. I just kind of gave up. I can't remember last time I checked my blood sugar. Don't check my blood pressure, what's the point? - John, could you explain maybe a little more? Why did you feel like there was no point? Why'd you feel like you just didn't matter? - Well, sometimes the docs, you know, \"Oh, you need to do this, you need to do that.\" And so I would do it. I would take my meds and stuff, and so I just kind of felt, wasn't in control. And so instead of worrying about it, I just kind of, you know, don't care. I think denial sometimes is a good place to be. I just deny it. - When I was a medical student, not only did I learn about, you know, the body and the diseases, but there was a big chunk of time spent on pharmaceuticals, and it was a very involved and complicated process. You're learning about the medications, how to prescribe them, their side effects, the interactions, when to stop them. Some you can only prescribe for two years. So it was overwhelming. So now we're in practice, and you're prescribing these medications to patients because we learned how to prescribe drugs. - I've noticed him getting really tired, and I've been worried with the blood sugar dropping 'cause it does it sometimes at night. - If I would to define my expectations of where I'd like to be versus where I am now, I would like to feel better. I'd like to feel happier. I would like to be less tired. I'd like to see my numbers showing I'm in better health, and I want her to be proud of me, and keep me on the straight and narrow. - I used to use the phrase on my wife, \"Rome wasn't built in a day.\" - \"In a day,\" yeah. - You know, go easy on me, you know? And I'm understanding. - That's what I told her. I said, \"My progress isn't your progress. Your trail's different than mine. And the more more I'm forced into it, the more I'm gonna resist and rebel, and so. - It takes time to bring it in, I think. - Yep. - \"Rome wasn't built in a day.\" That's a good saying for that, eh? - All right, Paul, what's your story? - Blood pressure since I was, I don't know, 35. Cholesterol, I was pretty high on the cholesterol 'cause of the way I ate. And they diagnosed me about seven years ago with type 2 diabetes. You know, over the last seven years, I ended up with four medicines, and then that still wasn't turning me around on my type 2 diabetes. My A1C went all the way up to 8.7. - And that's on these, all the meds? - On all the meds. - [Laurie] Okay. Wow. - I was high, and I'm still high, and pretty much, you know, I'd like to change that. The wife is telling me all about the vegan, and I'm. - I discovered plant-based first. My name is Leanne Demeduk. I'm from Des Moines, Iowa. - My name's Paul Demeduk, and married to my wife Leanne for, let's say, eight years now. It's close enough. - My father had died of cancer. My younger sister died of cancer. So I wanted to try and prevent that in myself and the rest of, you know, my family. So I was doing research and initially happened on PlantPure Communities, Dr. McDougall, you know, just researching. And I had no doubt that this was the way to prevent cancer and for Paul, to help, you know, treat his diabetes and hopefully reverse it and get him off his medications and insulin and things like that. - You've taken all these medicines, and now they're trying to reach out for something else that will work. You know, more medicine, in other words, is what they're doing to give me more and more. So that's what I'm doing right now. - There's so many things that come with diabetes that people don't think about at that first diagnosis, and they're handed that first pill, that we're just maybe slowing the train down the track, but the train is still going to that destination. The thing with the plant-based diet, we're actually derailing the train. We're taking it off the track, and we're putting it on a completely different trajectory, where trajectory towards health. - You know, maybe if I eat right, that's what I'm hearing from my wife. She's been working in dishes too. I mean, she ain't saying much. It's hard to get everything in, but she's been working in very delicious dishes. - Here, they have some polenta with spice. - [Recruit] Apple vinegar. - There's a teaspoon, two of those. I do like to cook, yes. I actually won the Betty Cracker Award in high school. So (laughs). So I got cashews, we got corn star, nutritionally used, Dijon mustard, lemon juice, garlic clothes and sea salt. - The plant-based world is so much different than it was 20, 30 years ago. We couldn't even get a soy milk. So, you know, we would go to Burger King 20 years ago with the kids, and we would ask for a bun with tomatoes, pickles and ketchup. And they thought it was great. (laughs) So it's very different now. - It has evolved. I don't know why, Kim, but some of the early recipes, they called for all those exotic ingredients. But if you cook with the basic ingredients, if you cook with potatoes and onions and peppers and beans and lentils and chickpeas, you can make a lot of food for very little money. - [Nelson] Healthy eating can also feel familiar. If you want a burger, there's a veggie burger. If you want mac and cheese, there's a plant-based mac and cheese. If you want pizza, there's a plant-based pizza. - That's kind of what we're doing here. We're taking people who are eating the standard American diet, and they're having health issues, and we're feeding them foods that kind of feel a little familiar to them. We're making Pad Thai tonight. We've done chili's. We're doing a beanie loaf, lasagna. So a lot of traditional comfort food. They haven't had any problems with the food. - Half of the time, I come to the table for dinner, and I'm not hungry because I've been tasting all this. - All right, so what is chronic disease? We kind of covered this, I'll kind of just kind of run through it again. So basically, one lasting three months or more by the definition of the US National Center for Health Statistics. When you look at the statistics, especially over the United States in the past 20, 30, 40 years, you'll see that as, there's no genetics that have changed. We've certainly changed our diet. And then when you see a standard American diet, and what people are eating, you'll see chronic disease is just flying through the roof. So absolutely nutrition is related to chronic disease. - [Nelson] It was my father who performed the pioneering research proving this point, which he summarized with my brother Tom in a best-selling book called \"The China Study.\" Today, millions know him as the science father of the plant-based nutrition movement. But his path was an unlikely one. - I am Colin Campbell, better known as T. Colin Campbell. I was raised on a farm in Virginia. We had dairy cows, and I learned how to milk actually when I was five years old, so I was into that. In any case, my dad sold the farm, and three months after, he sold the cows, 1956, I was at graduate school at Cornell University. Ironically, the research I did was focused on the idea that we need quality animal protein. Protein, protein, protein from the time I was a kid on the farm, I guess. But then I took my first faculty position at Virginia Tech, and there, I had an opportunity to coordinate a program feeding malnourished children in the Philippines, making sure that these kids got enough protein, animal-based if possible. But then I saw something that was kind of odd. The children who got the most protein, and not many, those families, they seemed to have a higher risk for getting liver cancer of all things. And so I came back and organized a research program at Virginia Tech at my home university. I learned, in fact, that, yes, we could turn on cancer by increasing animal protein or we could turn it off, that is toggle it on and off just by adjusting the kind of protein, the level of protein intake. Increasing animal protein turns cancer on. Decreasing it or replacing it with plant protein, turns it off. That was striking. We learned more and more that animal protein is not the save-all nutrient. Finally, after this research, and this was about 1980, I had a visit from China, a senior scientists from China come and spend some time in my lab for about a year. While he was with me, we discovered his government had just finished publishing a beautiful atlas. There was a book that shown where cancer was very common in some places and not in others. So we've got the idea, why don't we do a study somehow, you know, US/China study, and so we had an opportunity to compare those who were consuming more animal foods for those consuming a lot of plant foods. It was fantastic opportunity. Probably couldn't have been done any place else in the world. So you can see from this simple collection of observations that it involves the hormonal system, involves probably the immune system, involves enzyme mechanisms and all sorts of ideas. So we collected a huge amount of data on nutritional characteristics and the different diseases. And we took blood samples and food samples and so forth to analyze everything. What we learned there was the same thing as we had seen in the laboratory. People started to use more animal foods, their serum cholesterols went up, and heart disease and cancer rates went up. So all of a sudden, the China Study project essentially matched what we have seen in the laboratory. - And some people like, \"Oh, it's in my genetics.\" How many have been told that? \"Oh, diabetes is in your genetics. You're gonna get diabetes.\" \"Oh, heart disease is in your genetics. You're gonna get heart disease.\" I can tell you, yes, you may be more prone to something, but it doesn't mean that it's going to actually happen. So don't feel like that's your destiny. (gentle music) - All my numbers are down, and all my medications remain in their little packets in my suitcase. - [Laurie] Fantastic. - So I can't tell you how excited and shocked I am. I've already gone down a notch on the belt. I don't wanna make all of these guys jealous by talking about it all the time. (group laughs) - Okay, so, Rebecca, tell us your story. - My name is Rebecca Leissa. I am from Columbus, Ohio. My physical conditions consist of high blood pressure. I have borderline high cholesterol, and my triglycerides are always up in the 200s. I can't seem to get them down, and I have diabetes. I started researching about plant-based diet a little over a year or so ago and started making some changes, and I saw some results, enough to say, \"Oh, there's something here. I wanna do it more.\" - [Recruit] Rebecca needs some sugar, so. - Our graph says one point. Yeah, I think you'll get, right here's a treat. You should like this. (recruits chatting indistinctly) - I left early yesterday morning. I drove six hours, 400 miles with a broken arm. I didn't realize it was broken, but I had a very hard time pulling the gear shift out park into reverse and pulling it down into drive to get here. - That's amazing. I didn't think anyone was going to drive here that distance with a broken arm to get here. So you really, yeah. - Oh my gosh, I really wanted to go. I really want to learn this. I don't wanna be the next person. 'Cause I know people that have died from diabetes. I don't want the complications. It is a struggle with the cost of everything. Any of the treatments you do, the extra doctor's appointments, it's expensive. I would rather spend my money on other things. I had to stretch my insulin because I had five days till payday, and I didn't have the money to go get it because of the cost. I'm bound determined, I'm not gonna be the next one. I want to, I'm only 61. I wanna make it for a lot longer. I don't wanna die from this. I don't want complications. I don't wanna lose toes. I don't wanna lose a foot. I don't wanna lose my organs. I don't want the problems. I've got enough. I don't need more. - Thank you for sharing that. You're gonna have great results. You already are. - Yeah. In the last 48 hours, I have not been on insulin. Okay, I need the cauliflower. I have turned off my pump, and right now my sugar is 120. - Currently, I've got normal blood pressure. The last reading was 99. And the doctor in charge lowered my dose of insulin by half. I feel no adverse effects, and I have just as much energy, and I'm not as lightheaded as I was. I still feel a little bit of it, but I'm feeling like I'm getting better already. Red grape grapefruit, I haven't had red grapefruit since I got on diabetes meds 10 years ago. It's such treat. - [Nelson] All right, Joyce. - I've been diabetic for over probably 10 years, on insulin for about a year. Diabetes run in my family. Cancer runs in my family, Arthritis runs in my family. My name is Joyce Madkins. I live in Burlington, North Carolina. And I actually never heard of plant-based. How I got introduced to plant-based was through my pastor, Nelson called Reverend Mara at Jefferson Cross Baptist Church. He in turn called the members and wanted to know if any of us was interested in participating. And, of course, I said, \"Let me talk to my husband.\" And then I called Nelson, and I said yes. When I was a teenager, I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis. At that time, I don't think they really knew how to treat it, but I had to take 15 aspirins a day. That was, I guess, the start of it, of my illness. And then I start developing problems with my diabetes. So the doctor said, \"You're borderline.\" Then he put me on medication. So we tried the Metformin first. He took me off of that, and then we tried some other medicines. So at this point now, I'm on, I take blood pressure medicine, Benazepril. Simvastatin, I have cholesterol. Glimepiride, Januvia. Last year, they tried Trulicity, and the Trulicity, I could not do, because when I did the injection, you know, every week, it felt like someone had a bat hitting me in the stomach. So he put me on insulin. So I take 25 units of Tresiba. I actually had to get my friend who is a nurse to show me, to give me my first insulin shot. I said, \"Oh my, I can't do this.\" She said, \"Yes you can.\" I said, \"No I can't!\" But I did, so my last A1C, if I remember was like 12. But there was, I'm sorry. I am the primary support person for my family. My sister that's two years younger than me has depression. And I'm sorry. My mom died last year. (crying) Then my nephew died last year. Two months ago, my husband got sick. They found he had a spot on his lunge. So then we had to go see the cancer doctor. (crying) So. By me being the oldest, you know, everyone looks up to me. So I don't have time to get sick because, you know, I'm trying to take care of everybody else. - So when you look at the burden of chronic disease on patients and their families, it can be quite severe. And it not only takes a toll financially, but you're also looking at the time involved. So the caregivers have significant burden, not only to make sure that they're cared for themselves, which often is put to the side, but they're also caring for the individual with the chronic disease. So there's doctor's appointments. There's, will the insurance cover this medication, and then the insurance changes. It's not uncommon to have insurance changes at the beginning of the new year. So that insulin does no longer cover. So now I have to switch this insulin, and all the things that are involved with that. They have to figure out, \"Well how do I take off time from work?\" \"What do I do when we need to go out of town?\" Not only that, but the caregivers are actually watching their loved ones suffer. You know, and then the children, let's say there's kids in the home. Well, now the kids are also affected 'cause they're gonna think that this chronic disease is normal. And then there's a stress there. So the relationships are stressed. There's decreased sleep, anxiety, depression. It's just extremely burdensome for the whole family. - I do what I have to do. - [Recruit] That's right. - But the first thing you have to do is take care of Joyce. - This is true. - The doctor's visits and the medications, and you're not having these fluctuations of your blood sugar. I'm hoping that you'll find that you really are in tune with you and that you're calmer and able to handle all the added stress that aren't go away. Life, right? - No, this is life, no. With me, you know, my faith is strong. And you have to have that belief that you can change. You know, I pray, and, you know, God will give you what you need to do what you need to get done. You have to believe. And plus I have a, you know, with Reverend Martin, the church, we know we have a strong family as far as, you know, what do you need? What can we do? How can I help you? So, you know, and I'm excited to get back, and, you know, speak at the church. - [Nelson] All right, thank you. That was really wonderful. - You hear a lot of these type of stories, don't you? - We've heard a lot, yep, mm-hmm. Yep. - Do you see a common theme or a common thread? - Yeah, one common thread I think is people have no clue as to the power that they have over their health. People also think that changing their diet will be sacrificial. That they'll need to trade away the joy they derive from food to get healthy. Nothing could be further from the truth. - I get a lot of joy out of cooking this way because I love to see people surprised when food tastes as good as it did when they were eating the standard American diet. I made sour cream the other day, and they couldn't believe it was plant-based, because I worked and worked and worked on that sour cream to get it to taste as close as I could to what they were used to. - And I think we as cooks, it's pleasurable for us when people eat the food. That's what we're after as cooks. You know, when we see them filling the plate and coming back for seconds, that's what give us joy. - I'm Vignesh Shiram. I'm 18 years old, and I'm from Charlotte, North Carolina. I'm currently a student at the University of Chapel Hill. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol at the age of 15. I don't take any medications for the high cholesterol, but I take 30 units of long-acting insulin overnight, every day. When I was younger, although we grew up on an Indian diet, our parents didn't want us to feel isolated and alone from our friends. So processed food was a staple in our pantry. Unfortunately, that led into a spiral where I was gaining weight at an extreme rate, and I was considered morbidly obese for a good part of my life. And this led in a downward spiral until when I was in eighth grade, I wanna say maybe 13, I was 230 pounds at five foot. And I remember for my blackboard testing, we had to run a 5K, and I couldn't even cross the, I couldn't even like go forward without someone pushing me back. And that was one of the lowest points in my life. I think around eighth grade, I was about 230 pounds. Suddenly I lost 60, 70 pounds in a matter of like four to five months. Didn't raise any bells, no concerns. I was dropped, but I checked the doctors. They're like, \"It's fine. You're young. These things happen.\" I went for about a year without testing blood work. So after that year, I checked that I did blood work. My results came extremely high. So high, I was sent straight to the hospital for three days. And that's when I realized the secret behind my weight loss wasn't exercise or dieting. It was thanks to the type 2 diabetes, taking the fat in my body for energy. - It's kind of gradual, right? But though now we're seeing these chronic diseases in our children, but when we live in a society where the wrong choice is the easy choice, it's really hard to help our kids make better choices when the parents struggle to make better choices. So what happens is we're setting up our children, one, to be food addicts, and we're also setting 'em up to not understand that sweet from a fruit is the sweet that you should be enjoying, not the sweet from the artificial sweeteners. So we're hijacking their brain. We're hijacking their taste buds. So we're setting 'em up for a life of chronic disease. And that's so unfortunate because they're never gonna have the opportunity to even live a life without drugs. They're gonna think this is normal. Their parents took drugs, their grandparents took drugs, and now they're on drugs. That's how a human's supposed to live? Absolutely not. - So being diagnosed type 2, that's probably the best moment of my life. Now, obviously, it's terrible, but the way I look at it, if I wasn't diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, it would've been a heart attack. It would've been cardiovascular issues. It would've been kidney failure. If not diabetes, it would've led to something far worse. It was more of a wake up call to me than anything else, that I need to get my life together. I need to get it into my own hands without relying on the healthcare system, without having insulin pumped every single day, without having to worry about extremely low blood sugars, extremely high blood sugars, without counting how much insulin I needed to take. So I refused to let my life be dependent on something else, on something that I couldn't control. So I decided to take my life in my own hands. That's where, that's what led me to here this place, this wonderful opportunity as well, and I'm very excited. I've had only good food here. And to be able to eat three good meals every day, I am extremely happy with the way my body feels after three days. My sugars have remained in the double digits. Seeing such good results, I'm really hopeful with how the next seven days pan out. Because my sugar, today, morning, it was 85. - Three days ago when I came in, watched the numbers. And, you know, I'm just amazed that my numbers are so low without any insulin. I just, and all my meds, it's absolutely amazes me that I am that low. - So far the challenges of being plant-based have been, what to eat, how to fix things. Culinary is a big part of your lifestyle change. Do we have to use the whole cauliflower, a whole head of it? - No, no, no, use whatever you want. My hope is that when people leave this immersion, they'll be able to take away the skills that Fernando and I have taught people, the passion that we've shown them about food. Every day when they line up to get their dinners and their lunches, they love the food. So to go home and be able to build those foods in their own kitchen, that's my hope is that they will always be able to do this. And it kind of opens the door to a whole new culinary world. - And what I would also recommend to people is keep it simple, but also when you use resources like Kim's books and the internet, you can find a recipe for anything. There's a world of possibilities that you have from the diversity of plants. And when you're eating a diverse plant-based diet, you don't need to seek specific nutrients. You just eat the food that you enjoy in diversity, and your digestion and your body will balance it. - All the vitamins, the minerals, except B12, the fruits and vegetables, you'll get all the protein you need. You'll get all the vitamins, the minerals, and then fibers, which is only found in plants, so. - [Nelson] Plant-based foods have the perfect balance of nutrients, not only for the prevention and sometimes the reversal of chronic diseases, but also to fight off viruses like COVID-19. - Yeah, 'cause that natural immunity is really important, as, you know, in the course, anything we can do to improve our chances, should we get it to not have the significant side effects. - The biggest killer of people in the United States is chronic degenerative diseases. It kills in a neighborhood of 140 to 150,000 people a month. Most people getting and dying, suffering the consequences of COVID have other diseases that predispose them to difficulties of COVID. Early in the pandemic, we learned that the Italian health authority had commissioned a study on the people who were dying of COVID-19. And it turned out that at least 99% of the people who died had a precondition. These existing conditions included diseases like various kinds of heart disease, diabetes and so forth. Later on in the summer of 2020, the CDC followed up with a study that suggested that 94% of the COVID deaths occurred with people with preexisting conditions. - Well, just with his diabetes and high blood pressure and his other, you know, the chronic aspect to, you know, these illnesses, and that's who they say it hit the hardest, you know, was those with chronic disease, so. - And it's really sad when you look at the evidence, when you look at just the 18 months or so, 20 months that we have evidence of showing that chronic disease really astronomically increases your risk, right? So the unfortunate thing is we are not broadcasting to the world, \"Hey, you know, if we focus on prevention with nutrition like a whole food plant-based diet, the pandemic would not have been as significant. We wouldn't have had all these things happen.\" - The nutrition provided by a plant-based diet actually affects our immune system as well, in the same way that also works to prevent and actually reverse chronic degenerative diseases. The plant-based diet enhances the production of antibodies and the first line of defense in the formation of enhancing so-called T-cells, natural killer cells. We got some data on that particular point in our study of China involving a very serious virus that causes liver cancer. Those consuming more plant-based foods formed antibodies and didn't get the cancer from that virus. Those consuming animal food, they did not form antibodies. They kept the active virus called antigen. They got the liver cancer. Striking. So the effect of nutrition of the immune system is really fascinating. It does not involve a single nutrient. Basically, I'm talking about many possible mechanisms measured in the thousands, hundreds of thousands. But they all work together in coordination with each other. It's highly coordinated. When that happens, it affects not only one disease, it affects a variety of disease at the same time. That's why nutrition is so important. You got all these different nutrients in food working together, sort of coordinated like a symphony to create a response. It's amazing. - [Nelson] Going all the way back to the 1980s, my father went to Washington repeatedly to share his research. He testified in front of Congress and consulted with government agencies, but he continually ran into powerful interests who seemed intent on suppressing the truth he had discovered. Fast forward to the COVID pandemic, and nothing changed. Authorities in government failed to communicate the connection between nutrition and the risks of a COVID infection. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention listed on their website the actions people could take to reduce their risk. They failed to even include the word nutrition. - The pandemic that we've experienced, quite frankly has ignored the single most important lifestyle factor of all. And that is nutrition. We're ignoring the thing that really matters, and that's the food we eat and the nutrition that it provides. It's extremely important that we finally get to know what we have not known. - We're gonna begin with the states of emergency across this country. And now here in New York City, a state of emergency declared as well. - [Nelson] The media from across the political spectrum who derive a large share of their revenue from pharmaceutical ads also failed us. Some of the most influential voices understood the connection of chronic disease to immunity and COVID outcomes and the importance of healthy eating, but did not include this in the advice they repeated throughout the pandemic. - I think we can all agree that outdoor activities have been one of the bright spots during this pandemic, and it is true. You're a lot less likely to get infected if you're outside. The virus has a lot more room to disperse. And when you're outside, one of the things people like to do, barbecues. So if you're thinking about having a barbecue at your house, how do you do this as safely as possible? (birds singing) - All right, so I said to most of you a couple days ago, I think this could be really powerful, and maybe what we should do to get ourselves in the right frame of mind is just take a moment and kind of go into a quiet place and reflect on the journey that you've been on, the illness that you've suffered and what you've learned here. I want you to be reflecting on all those points. Okay, as you watch this. - I have the power to lower my A1C. - Because I can still make my own insulin, and Trulicity activates my body to release it. - [Narrator] Once weekly Trulicity is for type 2 diabetes. Most people taking it reached an A1C under 7%. Trulicity may also help you lose up to 10 pounds and lower your risk of cardiovascular events whether you know you're at risk or not. Trulicity isn't for people with type 1 diabetes. It's not approved for use in children. Don't take Trulicity if you're allergic to it, you or your family have medullary thyroid cancer or have multiple endocrine neoplasia syndrome type 2. Stop Trulicity and call your doctor right away if you have an allergic reaction, a lump or swelling in your neck, severe stomach pain, changes in vision or diabetic retinopathy. Serious side effects may include pancreatitis. Taking Trulicity with Sulfonylurea or insulin raises low blood sugar risk. Side effects include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea, which can lead to dehydration and may worsen kidney problems. - I have it within me to lower my A1C. - [Narrator] Ask your doctor about once weekly Trulicity. - [Nelson] Vignesh, you look like you're deep in thought here. - Like you said, I was very deep in thought, just even to calm down just 'cause I could feel my heart already racing. Because what they promote throughout their whole ad is a sense of hope for people with chronic disease, a sense that they can live an ordinary life, a life free of diabetes. But the way they approach it is in a very perverse way. - I think, yeah, they just really tried to pull the wool over people's eyes and make it look like, you know, you're just gonna live a happy, happy healthy life. Where in fact, you know, the disease is gonna get worse, the diabetes is gonna get worse. - The the other main thing I had a problem with with this commercial is the purple stripe at the bottom where they kept flashing, saying, \"Okay, certain side effects will be,\" and I couldn't read 'em because they flashed and then were gone. So they're almost like afraid to tell you that, \"Hey, it'll be more than just dryness of mouth or you might have a little upset stomach.\" You can't see all of those other side effects. - The first thing I noticed was that these people are all sunshine and flowers. Like this is a wonderful thing for you. And the last thing I noticed was that they said, this can affect your kidneys. And he was taking this until last week, and he has kidney disease. - Stage 4. - A doctor gave him something that could do even more harm, and none of it really works. - The first thing they said, they parsed the words, make it feel like your insulin's gonna take care of things. And frankly, their shot, they just keep increasing your doses, and, you know, milking the big cow. - It's money-driven. They want to keep making money, money and money. And if you have no hope, then you're gonna keep, \"Well, I'm gonna try this. Hopefully I feel better.\" But in the realm of thing, you don't feel better. You're just lingering, for a better word. - And Trulicity is expensive. I had to choose between taking Trulicity and going to a sleep doctor. And because of the cost of Trulicity, the cost of insulin, there were times that I went to a food pantry and got vegetables and stuff, every now and then. It wasn't all the time, but I have. - What would you tell people who are watching this commercial? - What would I say to someone watching this advertisement? I have no judgment for you. I truly empathize with the struggles you have had in your life that have led you to seeking hope in such a terrible way. But I'm about to offer you is not for everyone. There are people who can't handle it. Changing your habits, changing your mindset is not an easy thing to do. And if you feel like you can't handle it, then feel free. Take your pill. Just know your life will never be your own. If you value your free will, if you value what's been given to you, all you have to do is eat your vegetables. - I've been here only a week, and I know I have a long way to go, but I'm out walking. I was all riled up today and wanted to get going. Let's go do something. (Joyce laughs) But you know, that's only eight days. So I'm feeling the stiffness when I come out, when I get out of bed, I used to grunt and groan, grab onto the dresser, and, \"Ooh, get up.\" But now I'm just jumping right out. - As a physician, you become quite accustomed to patients coming into your office asking for a particular drug. And if you pay attention to the TV commercials, it's often the one that has been airing more recently, and they've become somewhat knowledgeable. They're thinking, \"Well, maybe this is what I've been looking for. This is the drug.\" So that commercial has actually been very effective in changing the behavior of the consumer. They're coming to me and asking for it. - The greatest cause of death in the United States is heart disease. And if some was the neighborhood of lifetime, it's 600,000 people a year. Second is cancer in the aggregate. I wanna say something else, I'm gonna throw it in here, and you might not want to use it. The third or fourth leading cause of death is the side effects of drugs. - [Nelson] Drugs have side effects because they're usually single chemicals taken at doses unnatural to the body. Drug companies can patent these chemicals to make money, but this way of thinking is based on a simplistic view of biology. - There's two views in terms of caring for our health. One way, we think about something very specific, a specific chemical or specific pill or procedure to control the disease, that's one way thinking about it. We're thinking about the part of a whole. The whole is actually offered by food, eating the right kind of food, the right combination of foods, if you will, plant-based foods. The whole is nature, that creates health. And that's a holistic effect that is very, very profound, very broad in it's effect, and it doesn't focus on one part. I'm talking about the whole, not just the parts. The moment we start talking about the parts, this chemical, that chemical, this procedure, that procedure, although they can do good at times, but when we come to rely on that idea, that's a mistake. - If you wanna get better, ignore the advertisements for Trulicity and let's go with the plant-based. As I said, try it. Because there are so many people that are suffering even in my church, in my family. They have diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol. The sad thing is a lot of people, myself included, we don't know we're in bondage. That's the sad thing about it. - Freedom in my mind's eye is being free of the yoke of the pharmaceutical companies controlling my life. Freedom means now I have the power in my mind's eye and in the skills that I need to truly empower myself. And so I no longer will celebrate July 4th. My new independence day, October 22nd. I'm free. (group laughs) I wanted to say we gotta make a parody of Trulicity or whatever. \"Hey, we got somebody take Trulicity,\" and then a while later, you know, the businessman and the phone rings. \"Hey, John and Paul got stage 4 kidney disease.\" \"Just a minute,\" buzz, and they hit a button, and it goes off in another office. It's the nephrologist, \"Hey, we got another client for ya.\" \"Oh yeah, that's great.\" \"Hey, John, we got something for your kidney problem here. We can give you this medication, and that's gonna cause another problem.\" And another bell go, \"Hey, we got a couple more guys on the line,\" buzz. And at the end you got like Satan on the end of the line. \"Yeah, this is great.\" (group laughs) - You know what? I feel like that's a good ending. (group laughs) (gentle music) - [Vignesh] Just show me how to start the fire. - We gotta have air, and you gotta have kindling. And it goes back to this little fire here. It's a lot like, I think, the plant-based movement. It starts small, and then you can build communities, and then you have the power of people, and it starts to to grow in intensity. - [Nelson] It's easy to despair today, but history is full of big changes, which always started when people were motivated by a powerful truth. - Thank you everyone for the 10 days. This has been phenomenal. I just kind of wanna give you a quick summary of the medical component of this, which is absolutely phenomenal. We had a total of 54 pounds with the eight of you lost. And you've lost 10 pounds. - Yes. - Which is pretty cool. So you have lost six pounds, you've lost seven pounds. But let's talk about our cholesterol because that was really the main issue for you. - Yes. - So when you came in, your total cholesterol was 202, and your LDL was 121. So after 10 days on a whole food plant-based diet, the results today that came in, there we go. Total cholesterol 166. - Oh my gosh, I never had that low. - And your LDL was 97. - Wow. - That's just 10 days. Like just about a what? A almost a 50 point drop. - That's amazing. - Total cholesterol 168. - Oh! - Yeah, an LDL 91. So your next lab results show a total cholesterol of 123 points. - Wow. - And your LDL stayed around 42. So those are phenomenal. You're a young person 'cause that means that plaque is building up. But now your total cholesterol 123, - Woo. - You're the biggest drop of everybody. - You're joking? - No. The total cholesterol drop on average was over 20%. Your LDL cholesterol, which can cause plaque to build up in your arteries, dropped by nearly 25%. So that alone is exciting, but we've stopped medications. You had cholesterol issues, diabetes, high blood pressures. Now you're off all of your hypertension meds, which were three. You were on two diabetic meds, those are stopped. Your blood sugars look great. Your blood pressures are normal. So you've had about a 95% drop in your insulin. You use a pump. - Yes. - But now you're on literally a tiny microdose. Three high blood pressure meds, five diabetes meds, including 54 units of long-acting insulin. - That's correct, yeah. - And you have had normal blood pressure. - Yes. - 118 over 60-something this morning. - Yes. - And normal blood sugars. - Yep. - Like 80 this afternoon. - Without the drugs. I haven't had the drugs in 10 days. - I keep forgetting about that. - Right, and we stopped your gout medicine. I forgot. - That's right. - So that's nine medicines we've stopped. Nobody's on insulin except a few, and you're on 95% less or 60% less. That's absolutely phenomenal. Blood pressure is improving, even on blood pressure medication, dropping 50 points systolically into a great normal range. So these are some amazing results. I hope you guys really understand how incredible that is, and that you'll continue this journey. So congratulations, and thank you for letting me be a part of your journey. So I'll turn it over to Nelson. - Well, as I said at the beginning, we've been doing these immersions for a long time and at different places around the country. But I just wanna share one thought with you. It took me a while to figure this out. You know, initially, I thought this was about plant-based nutrition. Then I thought, well, more generally it's about health. But then I realized it's really about something else. And the something else is the challenge of taking responsibility for our lives. And when you make that decision, you gain freedom. You know, several of you said that you have a new lease on life, and I think that's because you've discovered the power of taking responsibility for your health. So with that said, why don't we just share a closing thought. John? - I came here not so much skeptical but hopeful, and the results I've seen are just amazing. But it also opened up a new possible chapter to my life. And then I realized with this, this is more, it's so, holistic is such a small word, but like he said, you got personal accountability, responsibility for your own life. But then I realized there's more to it. There's treating the land with respect. There's the treatment of animals. There's also a spirituality component of it. And so, like I said, there's freedom, and I think it gave me power in that, it's not a secret, but I have something that's too good not to share. - [Nelson] I love that. Kim? - Well, just, it's been a phenomenal week and just great. And I can't wait to see what the future holds. - Yep. - It's given me a new sense personal responsibility, especially towards my own health. But I also feel like it's given me a direction in which I can take my life. Because I genuinely believe that if someone like me can see such amazing results, anyone can. It's like finding a little gem. You just wanna show it to the world. You just wanna share that passion and that knowledge and that excitement. And I'm very happy, and I'm very hopeful for the future. - [Nelson] Thank you. Paul? - I wasn't the best starter, but I went into the program, and, you know, I was able to drop all my meds, which was my goal, and all my numbers all lowered. And thanks to all the education, teaching us, it's gonna be a long way, and things will keep coming down, taking responsibility of my health myself instead of being medicated all the time, job well done. - [Nelson] That's great, Paul. Leanne? - I would just like to thank you so much for giving us this opportunity. I mean, at one of 'em, I said, \"This is our second lease on life,\" you know? And before I just, you know, I tried everything to lose weight, and nothing really stuck, but it was a personal responsibility that I hadn't really taken, you know, to heart. I'm real excited about that, so. - [Nelson] Joyce? - The only thing I could say is this has been a game changer. In participating in this, I was hopeful, but everything happened beyond my expectations, and I appreciate the staff, all you guys for leading us on this journey. It's a journey. Thank you so much for what you've done, and I'll pray that you continue to do good work. - [Nelson] Thank you. Rebecca? - I came very hopeful and wasn't sure what to expect or what would I see because I've tried so many things to lose weight, and nothing's worked. I've lost 10 pounds. I've reduced my insulin consumption about 95%, or reduced one blood pressure medicine. I found some great food recipes that I really liked, and I'm a picky eater, that I will be making when I get back home. And I felt this was a really good start for my journey of trying to keep it going, the momentum going, because I wanna get off the insulin. I want the other 5% to go. - [Nelson] Dennis? - All the adjectives that I have about this week, they're insignificant. I am so grateful that you guys have showed us a path and gave us the first steps to get on that path. What remains for us is decisions. Those decisions, in my mind, aren't going to be that difficult, to remain on the path, and to also show other people the path. I believe that this is a path worth going down. (crickets chirping) - [Nelson] When our participants left for home, they went with the hope of a better life. We've seen this at the end of all of our immersions, but this ending is always only the beginning. (gentle music) - What I did is got out of the immersion, and I was off all my insulin. In January, they gave me a bad number on my A1C, went up to 7.5. In early February, I went back on insulin, and now I'm on like 90 units of insulin. If I lose weight, they're telling me I'll go back to, you know, to no, to zero insulin. And that's what my goal is. I like everything she cooks. Beanie loaf, I love the beanie loaf she makes, and love the green bean casserole. At home, I eat whatever Leanne makes, and I enjoy it. - And when we came back, we were very 100% for I think at least a good month and a half. So the downslide for me happened. I went to visit my daughter in Texas about a week before Christmas. They definitely are not plant-based. I mean, won't even consider it. We do struggle. You know, we're back now in an urban situation and lots of restaurants, and that's kind of always been our weakness. - I think eating out for me, I can't speak for Leanne, but I like to, you know, you get kind of bored around. \"Let's go out and do something fun,\" you know? And so I think it is a feel good kind of thing. - So back in the real world, there's just too many options because I do know what to do, and I know the benefits, and, you know, I had just sabotage myself. This is Iowa. So it's kind of beef capital and hog capital. (laughs) So, you know, and people kinda look at ya. My sister and I wanna start a pod here in Des Moines. So we've talked about it, and just need to kind of take the leap. - But like I say, \"Rome wasn't built in a day,\" and we're both heading in the right direction, and we realize what our weaknesses are, and we're working on 'em. - [Nelson] Paul and Leanne's story is a common one. We've seen many people fall off the wagon after an immersion, but we've also seen them get back on. We tell people, \"It's okay to stumble. Otherwise, it wouldn't be a journey.\" (lively country music) - Now that it's been six months, I'm feeling really great. My blood pressure is normal, and my cholesterol is down under 120, and my A1C is in the fives. In terms of medications, I'm only taking an aspirin. My wife is very proud of me. It's a little bit of a turnaround because she was always pushing me to eat this vegetable or that fruit or this dish. And now I'm the one who's coming up with very creative dishes. I've been noticing that my grocery bill has been $40 for six bags of groceries instead of the 115 I used to pay. Both my wife and I ride motorcycles. Since I've returned from the immersion study, I've got such good results from the plant-based lifestyle that I'm sharing it with some of the people that I ride motorcycles with. Prior to the immersion study, I think the old Dennis would've thought he had all the freedom he wanted because he was being treated for the problem. And so he wanted to continue to eat those ribeye steaks. And I think that there is a lot to be gained by reassessing how much personal responsibility you take. If you decide not to be responsible, then you become one of a group, and you start thinking in terms of exactly what the group thinks as opposed to staying an individual so that you can do the things that you want and have the freedom that you want. There's a little bit of peace knowing that now that I'm healthier, that I'm going to be living longer, and that I will have the opportunity to see grandchildren come. So now it gives you a little more peace and happiness. - [Nelson] The first obstacle in making change is the challenge of opening our eyes. I watched my dad confront his biases from life on a dairy farm, and I saw him challenge for decades the prevailing views in his profession. He soon found himself alone among his peers, but he was an individual thinking freely, and he was able to ask the hard questions that led him to the most important health truth of our time. (bright music) - I think my life is a lot better with minimal insulin. I don't even use it regularly. I've had Burger King onion rings, that'll send it up. And so I'll just give myself a couple insulin units, and, you know, it comes back down. My A1C is down to 5.7, which is normal. - In the last six months since the immersion, I've noticed sort of an evolution happening where foods that bothered him before, like if the immersion, when we ate rice, his blood sugar spiked, but now he can eat white rice, and he does fine. He's lost 30 pounds, I've lost 15 pounds. - I like being able to do stuff. Before, I would be short of breath, and now I can work outside in the hot sun, work on motorcycles, cars. And like I said, I kind of have a, quote, new hobby. I used to like to barbecue stuff, but now I'm playing with vegan burgers. Cooking plant-based has removed problematic things in the kitchen. We don't need a vent fan now 'cause there's no greasy odors to get rid of. We don't use near as much dish-washing liquid because you don't have the, quote, baked on greasy residue. - We eat out a couple of times a week, but we have a few restaurants close by that they offer like a falafel sandwich. They have a marinated tofu sandwich, an avocado sandwich. - After the immersion, the freedom that I've gained through a plant-based lifestyle has been remarkable. Every day is a new day because I was on a terminal road to death basically. And so, but now I'm more conscious, and even Kim said this before we went to the immersion. \"Everything you put in your mouth has a consequence.\" It was like, \"Nah, it doesn't.\" And then now it's like, \"Yeah, it does. It really does.\" - Where do we go from here? I just see, you know, a lifetime where we're gonna be more active and having a good time and just making the most of our days really. - [Nelson] Knowing the health benefits of plant-based nutrition is just a starting point. The harder part comes later. It's constant awareness of what we are eating and it's consequences that seems to win the day. (gentle music) - I came back from the immersion in Greensboro very excited. I started out preparing food, but my husband, some of the food he wouldn't eat. He's a meat and potato man. For the plant-based diet to be successful, the partners, the husband and wife have to be on one accord. If you don't, it's gonna be split. Right now, my diet is, I would say, 35% plant-based, and I'm taking 16 units of insulin. Some days I feel optimistic, and some days I don't. For an example, my sister, as I stated in the immersion, her dementia is a little worse. She's still staying by herself. So when I call her, she doesn't answer the phone. So when I tell her, I said, \"You know, when I call, you answer the phone. If you don't answer, I think something's wrong.\" But anyway, but we. Excuse me. And it is really difficult, you know? And sometimes, you just forget about eating. So it is hard. You have to to breathe. Sometime, I just say, \"Okay, what about me?\" And that's when I have to take a trip to the casino. (Joyce laughing) Oh, boy. This idea of personal responsibility is more complicated than people realize. I know that I have to maintain my health in order for me to have the freedom to help other people. It's still a work in progress, and by God's grace is gonna happen. (gentle music) - The doctor feels that I need to take more insulin. Since the immersion, I am running about 20 to 40 units a day. Some of the challenges that I've had since the immersion is, I've had some medical issues. I did fall, twist and bruised my leg pretty bad. I have now been on a walker for 12 weeks. I am struggling with my medical bills now, and I gave up my car for medical reasons. The car will be picked up tomorrow, and then on top of that, you add my grocery budget has doubled. I try to go to the food pantry once a month to help supplement what I need. I worry about the financial stress of it. I'm sometimes at night, I'm thinking of how am I gonna do this? Some of the personal challenges that I've had with this is, you know, I fight with food addictions. One is potato chips, and the other one is an addiction to pops. I know it's bad for me, but it has control of me, and it's very hard, and I still fight it. It's like a comfort, but it doesn't really comfort me. I feel horrible afterward, and not just physically, but emotionally too. When I came back from being at the immersion, I had shared with a friend, and she's like, \"Yeah, wow, that's pretty good, but I'm not giving up my meat.\" My friend who was very skeptical about me going, said that I'm eating too much fruit, and she gave me a cantaloupe one day, and she told me, \"Now you can only eat a third of that.\" I'm living alone, and I'm doing all of this myself. It would be nice if I could be around other people that are on this journey with me. I'm still on this journey. I'm still trying to improve, but one step at a time. - [Nelson] We've seen people heal when they change their diet, but circumstances can complicate this decision, which is why a simplistic view of personal responsibility can get a bad rap. Blindness to the plight of others can lead to judgment, disregard and a surrender to the status quo. We've found there's always reason for hope because circumstances can change. - It's been a very hectic six months. My first year of college is officially over. I am off, completely off my insulin. I have had a few low moments and high moments these past six months, but for the most part, I am completely off. Cooking plant-based is easier because I have a larger variety of tools at my hand to try different ideas and to experiment a little more. I also cook in our communal kitchen a lot where you obviously meet a lot of new people, a lot of people from different walks of life. We even cook for each other. Try try each other's food. It's a nice experience. Prior to this experience, I was an introvert. I'm not a very social person, but now I feel a lot more confident, a lot more vibrant, and I find it a little easier to get to know people just from engaging more in the community, going to the kitchen more, even meeting people at the grocery store. I think there are both challenges and opportunities shifting your lifestyle to plant-based, especially without as many social connections. I think that without having that support, it's very difficult. It's very hard to stand up by yourself, but obviously I'm surrounded with people who love me and people who support me. I think that caring about your health is caring about yourself, and to be honest, it also leads to mental health as well. And I think that, yeah, it's also helped my mental health quite a bit, especially because being more outgoing, interacting with more people has obviously lifting a burden off of my mind that I always had especially as a kid. The freedom you gain is like a breath of fresh air. When you realize how clean the world really is, you have a very low desire to go back to the way things were. And I think that freedom comes when you're free of that chain around you of that addiction to food and that addiction to dairy and meat. You realize how much more energy and how much more time you have to spare and how much like larger the world actually is. So you just see that walking outside is easier when you start caring about your health. The wind is nicer, the birds sound happier. The whole world is brighter. I don't know how to explain it. - [Nelson] We undertook the live-in immersion in Greensboro because we wanted to see the full healing power of a plant-based diet. We thought this was especially relevant today. - Getting answers for you this morning about why COVID-19 cases are on the rise yet again. We spoke with an expert about the increase and how the Omicron sub variant is mutating. - [Reporter] COVID cases are up as the BA.5 variant spreads like wildfire. - And experts warn, when it comes to pandemics, COVID-19 may not be the big one. - [Reporter] North Carolina ranks first in the nation when it comes to poultry sales. Earlier this year, avian flu outbreaks in Johnson and Wayne County resulted in a loss of more than 100,000 turkeys and 300,000 chickens. Human transmission is possible, but it's unclear how likely a human outbreak could be. Animal to human transmission of viruses is becoming more common. - Any one animal can transmit a pathogen to another. Somebody buys it, handles it, takes it home as a pet or eats it. Boom, we have another pandemic. - The encroachment of human species into areas where animals are present, you know, increases that chance for all sorts of pathogens, mainly viruses, to sort of jump from one species to the other. - [Reporter] That's becoming more common. In just the last century, humans destroyed half of the world's rainforest. - The next one could be worse, it could be more contagious or more lethal or both. - [Analyst] The world needs to prepare for a major pandemic. The question is not if we will have another pandemic but when? - [Nelson] How will we respond when confronted by another COVID variant or new virus? - Take a look. You can see all five boroughs have a high community level that is prompting health officials to issue a recommendation for New Yorkers to wear their masks again. - We need to be using the mitigations that we have available. Masking where appropriate, vaccinating people who aren't vaccinating and boosting people. - I know some are talking about living with COVID-19, but tonight I say that we never will just accept living with COVID-19. We'll continue to combat the virus as we do other diseases. - [Nelson] Will we truly follow the science the next time around? - It is very easy to pick out an individual and make them a target because that's what people can focus on. But they're really criticizing science because I represent science. - The CDC is the premier epidemiological organization on the face of the planet. - Take the big picture, as we said before, CDC is science-based and data-driven. - My job as the director of this agency is to protect the public health. You know, Delta changed things, and the science for Delta evolved, and my responsibility was to review the science, review it carefully, and we are actively following the science. - The solution seems obvious, follow the science. - [Nelson] If science is a process of humble inquiry and search of truth, and if our leaders acted in accordance with science, they would stand on the rooftops shouting out the true source of our healing. Perhaps we could then get to work building a plant-based world. Making this change will require individual initiative along with educational food and social support to create the conditions that help give expression to this initiative. We also need to believe in ourselves. At our rally in Washington, my dad spoke about a society under the thumb of powerful interests. Perhaps it's our inability to control our collective future that is at the root of our hopelessness, but the deepest power, the kind that transforms, rests not with the corrupt few, but with the many, the rest of us. This is a power rooted in our local communities. It's time we turn our gaze inward and join with the people around us in our families, friend circles, neighborhoods, and wherever else we are living to begin building the world we want. This is how we'll find freedom from those who profit at our expense. It's time for healing. It's time we stand back up and face our future with confidence.

        "content": "2nd Pillar of Health: DETOXIFICATION\nHaving completed the first and most important pillar of health—Food, we now move on to the second pillar of health—Detoxification. First, let's discuss the cellular structure of our body.\nCells are the fundamental building blocks of all organisms. The human body is made up of over 37 trillion cells. Each cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm containing various organelles. The cell membrane separates the cytoplasm and nucleus from the external environment, which contains nutrients. After nutrients penetrate the cell membrane, they are metabolized and turned into energy that fuels the cell’s life functions. The by-products of this metabolic activity are waste products that need to be removed from the cell through the same cell membrane. Any impairment in a cell's ability to let nutrients in or let waste out leads to death by starvation or toxicity. This concept in Yoga is called Prana and Apana.\nAs you can see from this discussion, detoxification is almost as important as nutrition. For good health, it is necessary not only to avoid the absorption of toxins into our body by avoiding sources of toxins in our food and environment but also to engage in activities that facilitate their elimination. Clearly, our goal should be to reduce the level of toxins we absorb and regularly engage in ways to detoxify our body. There are two types of toxins: External and Internal.\nExternal Sources of Toxins\nOur body can absorb toxins from the following sources:\n1. The food we eat\n2. The water we drink and bathe with\n3. The air we breathe\n4. The lotions we apply to our body\n5. The household cleaners we use\n6. The medications we take\nMajor Sources of Toxins In Food\n1. Hydrogenated Oil, also called vegetable shortening (Dalda & Crisco)\n2. Artificial sweeteners\n3. Mono Sodium Glutamate (MSG), commonly used in Chinese food\n4. Preservatives in packaged foods classified as “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS)\n5. Pesticides in fresh produce\n6. Traces of growth hormones, antibiotics, pesticides (fed to dairy cows), and pus in cow’s milk\n7. Refined Sugar and/or High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS). All soft drinks and 80% of the packaged items in grocery stores have added sugar or HFCS.\n8. Refined Oils with excessive Omega-6\n9. Excessive Animal Protein\n10. Municipal Water Supply\n11. Alcohol and Tobacco\nGRAS & CRISCO\nWhen we buy packaged food, we assume it is safe, believing some organization has ensured its safety. This is a common misassumption. “GRAS” stands for “Generally Recognized as Safe.” Many foods and additives fall into this category, with the burden of proof of safety lying with the food company.\nA notable example of GRAS is vegetable shortening, also known as hydrogenated fat. In America \"Crisco\" is well-known while \"Dalda\" was popular in India. William Proctor and James Gamble, originally soap and candle makers, developed a process to hydrogenate oils, turning them into solids. This innovation led to the creation of Crisco, marketed as a healthier alternative to animal fats. Crisco became an overnight success. However, after more than a century, the scientific community recognized its fatal consequences, leading to bans in many countries. Despite this, trans fats like Crisco (Dalda) remain legal in India.\nInternal Sources of Toxins\nThe metabolic activity in our body, involving various chemical reactions happening in our trillions of cells, also releases metabolic waste that needs to be cleared. Besides this there are four other internal toxins:\n1.Dead and damaged cells\nThese cells release toxic chemicals damaging healthy cells adjoining them.\n2.Misfolded proteins\nSometimes there is error in making new protein molecules and a mirror image gets created which is of no functional use. These just sit in our body and need to be removed.\n3.Senescent Cells\nThese are cells which have stopped reproducing. These hamper the functioning of the healthy cells around them.\nThese internal toxins prematurely age our body. Their removal is of utmost importance for healthy aging. So the question arises: how do we remove these toxins from our body? The following list summarizes various detoxification techniques.\n1.Body’s Natural Responses:\nBreathing, sweating, urinating, and bowel movements are the body’s natural responses for regularly excreting waste and toxins. Additionally, when we consume food that our body recognizes as toxic, the body’s natural response is to vomit or pass it through the colon as loose motion.\n2.Daily Routine:\nBrushing teeth, showering, and bathing are part of our normal routine. Steam showers and saunas are also good detox practices.\n3.Water Therapy:\nThere are several techniques for water therapy:\n* Drinking 2-3 glasses of warm water first thing every morning is a good detox habit.\n* In Japanese water therapy, it is recommended to drink one liter of water instead of 2-3 glasses. While I do not know enough to recommend it, intuitively, it should not be done more frequently than once a week.\n* One of the Yoga techniques listed below as Dhauti (Varisara Dhauti, also known as Shankhaprakshalana) is also a water therapy.\n4.Fasting:\nFasting is an ancient practice common in various forms in many cultures. It is no coincidence that two Nobel prizes in Physiology in the last seven years have been awarded for research on this subject. Intermittent fasting, also known as time-restricted feeding, is an ancient Indian practice known as Chauvihar among followers of the Jain religion.\nThere are many clinics worldwide that focus on fasting, such as True North Health Center in Santa Rosa, California, which uses continuous water only fasting for up to 40 days to treat severely ill patients. I recommend the following fasting practices:\n* 16:8 Intermittent Fasting to be practiced daily.\n* One full day of water fasting every two weeks, similar to the custom of Ekadashi fasting in India, practiced on the 11th day of the lunar cycle. It can be practiced on any convenient day of the week, but that day must be followed every other week.\n* Once or twice a year, a 9-day OMAD (One Meal A Day) fast, similar to the custom of Navratri fasting in India.\nWe will cover the subject of fasting separately in coming weeks.\n5.Yoga Techniques:\nIn ancient Indian Yoga practices, six techniques for internal cleansing are prescribed. These are collectively known as Shatkarmas and include:\n- Dhauti\n- Basti\n- Neti\n- Trataka\n- Nauli\n- Kapalbhati\nExcept for Kapalbhati and Neti, all others should only be done under expert supervision.\n6.Colon Hydrotherapy:\nThe main goal here is to clear the colon of stagnant, supposedly toxic waste encrusted on colon walls. Doing so would enhance the vitality of the body. It also improves the immune system because 70% of our immune cells reside in our colon. Two of the Shatkarma techniques called Dhauti (Varisara) and Basti also achieve the same goal.\n7.Yoga Asanas:\nHatha Yoga practice is a good way to detoxify our endocrine system. It also helps detoxify the lymphatic system.\n8.Nadishodhan Pranayam:\nPranayama are breathing techniques that help remove toxins. Among various techniques, Nadishodhan is especially effective, and practicing it for 15-20 minutes every morning can help the body tremendously. Kapalbhati, another good technique (listed in section 5) is also beneficial.\n9.Walking:\nWalking is a very good way to detoxify our lymphatic system. Every cell in our body eliminates waste, which goes either into our lymphatic system or into the blood circulatory system. The lymphatic system does not have a pump like the blood circulating system. It works only by the movement of the body. Therefore, I recommend an active lifestyle with 10,000 steps each day. It is also important to include some arm raises as part of walking.\nConclusion:\nThe second pillar of health, Detoxification, emphasizes the importance of eliminating toxins from the body, complementing the first pillar, Food. Detoxification involves not only getting rid of external toxins but also removing cellular and metabolic waste to prevent toxicity. Effective detoxification methods must include fasting regimens in addition to daily hygiene routines, water therapy and walking.\nGenerally Recognised As Safe?Food Additives Secret\nhttps://youtu.be/opDYaKdzIqo\n—————————————-\nEND OF POST\n—————————————-",

        "content": "•Intermittent Fasting (IF)•\nHuman  body evolved over millions of years eating mostly fruits and vegetables with some beans, cereals, nuts and seeds. Another observation about our evolution is that we finished our dinners by sunset and next morning we went in search of food, to return by late morning or early afternoon and prepared our lunch. The gap between the two meals was any where from 12-16 hours. It is only in last 10,000 years, when we settled down and started farming and keeping animals for milk and meat, that food became readily available to have morning breakfast. Prior to these 10,000 years, we faced periods of feasts and famine regularly. The result is that our body evolved to store surplus food in the form of fat in our fat cells. The number of fat cells stop increasing after certain age but each cell has almost unlimited capacity to store fat. Human body is very efficient in converting carbohydrates into fat and this is happening all the time. However the conversion of fat into energy, which again is a straight forward process, does not happen as easily any more. The reason for this is that we do not face any periods of famine any more. This is, as if, our body has forgotten how to burn fat to produce energy.\nThis happens because, before we can burn all the calories from the previous meal, we eat another meal, that supplies fresh batch of calories. Many of us eat five meals a day; bed tea/coffee, breakfast, lunch, evening tea/coffee and dinner. Some take additional snacks in between or snacks with evening alcohol or a glass of milk before bedtime. The result is that our pancreas are releasing insulin all the time and the only rest they get is for 8 hours during sleep. This constant presence of insulin in our body from 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 at night leads to many chronic problems which we will discuss later but for now please understand the presence of insulin interferes with the ability to burn fat.\nMany of us incorrectly believe that during fasting the body must be slowing down the metabolic rate but the reverse is true. When body burns fat it produces ketones and the brain functions very well with ketones. The process is called Ketosis and during ketosis, when brain receives ketones, instead of glucose, it realizes that there is food shortage. The brain thereby increases the metabolic rate to sharpen the body and mind, as if it is telling you to go out and search for food.\nI highly recommended all to compress your eating window from 16 hours to a shorter period and increase the fasting window to a longer period. This concept is called Chauvihar in the Indian Jain community and “Intermittent Fasting” in the modern scientific community (also called “Time Restricted Feeding”). In addition, it helps the body heal better and develop better immunity when we subject it to periods of famine by fasting for a period of 16 hours or longer.\nThe concepts of  intermittent fasting (IF) and extended fasting have gained momentum in the western world only recently but it has been practiced in the East for thousands of years.\nBased on research on mice, we have known for over six decades that regular fasting improves health and increases life expectancy by up to 50% in mice. However the reasons for this were not clear. The Nobel prizes in physiology in 2016 and 2018 have been awarded for research on this subject and now we understand the reasons also.\nThe other terms used to describe the practice of IF are “Reduced Eating Window” or “Time Restricted Feeding”. The goal in intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window to as narrow as possible. The ultimate in intermittent fasting is “One Meal A Day” (OMAD) plan; when your fasting window becomes 23 hours. Many Indian spiritual masters practice this.\nIn intermittent fasting the idea is to finish your dinner early and delay your first caloric meal of the morning, so that the eating window can be narrowed to 8 hours or less. This helps in two main ways:\n(1) Firstly it gets the body used to the idea of burning fat to produce energy in the form of ketones. This increases the metabolic rate and thereby helps loose fat.\n(2) Secondly it promotes autophagy which has many detoxing benefits and builds immunity. Autophagy was first discovered by Belgian biochemist Dr. Christian De Duve,  who received a Nobel prize for his discovery in 1974. He discovered that every cell has a kind of recycling department called lysosome which is like the stomach of the cell having enzymes that can help recycle wasted protein into amino acids. Lysosome stores worn out or damaged tissues, food particles, bacteria, viruses and other junk that accumulates in the cells. Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi discovered that during fasting, the body is under stress and no new protein (amino acids) is available. At that time Lysosome decomposes waste proteins into amino acids which can be used to make new cells.\nDuring the fasting period it is best to avoid all beverages except plain water. Some doctors allow consumption of any beverage which do not have any calories eg. black coffee or tea or plain water with lemon, ginger, turmeric, or amla extract etc. There are mixed views on it. If your goal is only to lose weight and your caffeine addictions doesn’t allow keeping longer fasting windows with out caffeine consumption that it may be okay to consume black coffee or tea without sugar but if possible please avoid anything but water.\nIntermittent fasting can be started slowly by first observing a 12 hour fasting window and then increasing it to 14 hrs. and 16hrs. or more.\nThere are other ways to do intermittent fasting called 5/2 or alternate day method where you reduce your meal to a low calorie (under 500 calories) on two days in a week or every alternate day. I do not recommend these approaches as your body’s circadian rhythm never gets used to the pattern and on fasting days you do feel hungry. In 16:8 pattern, within three weeks, your circadian rhythm takes over and you don’t feel hungry in the morning.\nWalking or exercising during the fasting window enhances the effect of IF. One mile walk is equivalent to one additional hour of fasting. Therefore it helps to do your exercises during the fasting window.\nWhen we eat frequently and for longer periods, our blood sugar stays elevated for longer than normal. This is because insulin can’t efficiently clear it – this leads to the formation of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). This process accelerates aging by triggering inflammation, neuropathy, fine lines and wrinkles and much more.\nThe health benefits of intermittent fasting include following:\n1. Reduction in fat mass\n2. Increased insulin sensitivity\n3. Lower inflammation\n4. Improved heart function\n5. Increased mitochondrial volume\n6. Improved body repair processes\n7. Aerobic endurance improvements.\nNOT FOR EVERYONE\nIntermittent fasting is not for everyone and following groups should avoid fasting window longer than 12 hours.\n1. Pregnant Women\n2. Children under 16\n3. People with eating disorders like bulimia\n4. People with gall bladder issues.\nIF  SCORE\nThere is a way to monitor your IF progress by computing your intermittent fasting score and tracking it.\n• IF score is calculated weekly.\n• Compute the time gap between you last caloric food intake in the evening and the first caloric food intake of the morning (in hours).\n• Add to this total miles walked or equivalent exercise, during this period (after dinner and before breakfast). This is your score for the day.\n• Now add this score for the 7 days of the week and grade your self based on the following criteria:\nA.  Over 140   Excellent\nB.  120-140    Very Good\nC.  100-120   Good\nD.   80-100     Fair\nF.  Under 80   Poor\nA Nobel Prize Diet\nhttps://youtu.be/bo2n50O3orY\nA One Day Starvation Secret",

        "content": "•• Intermittent Fasting ••\nSIDE  EFFECTS\nWhen one starts Intermittent Fasting some people are able to jump right into it very easily but others face some difficulties. Most side effects are temporary and due to adaptive process of the body. These go away within few days. If you experience hunger and are unable to keep a longer fasting window of 16 hours; it is a good idea to expand your fasting window slowly by one hour each week.\nHere are some common side effects of Intermittent Fasting:\n1. Headache, dizziness, mental fog and feeling a little sluggish. These are withdrawal symptoms because most people are addicted to food and when denied, they experience such withdrawal symptom. One reason for feeling this way is electrolyte imbalance. In the absence of salt, that comes from food, body looses water impacting the electrolyte balance. It is a good idea to drink water with some Himalayan salt and lemon juice mixed in.\n2. Mood Swings: Just another withdrawal symptom.\n3. Upon breaking fast one may feel bloated specially if you eat too much food. too quickly.\n4. Feeling nauseated when you eat. It may be due to sluggish liver and gall bladder and adaptive response of the body. Having ginger tea can help. This should go away within a few weeks.\n5. Experiencing Diarrhea: When we burn fat during ketosis, the fat cells also release some toxins which were stored in the fat cells over time. Human body has a defense mechanism called PPRAY pathway by which toxins are stored in the fat cells. These released toxins can cause diarrhea and be excreted. Taking a tablespoon of Psyllium husk in the morning can help with diarrhea.\n6. Acid Reflux: Take fresh lemon or lime juice and/or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with warm water in the morning.\n7. Feeling Cold: Again a temporary affect and goes away in few weeks.\n8. Insomnia: When we fast body experiences stress and produces counter regulatory hormones like Cortisol, Epinephrine, Noradrenaline, Glucagon and human growth hormones. This is body’s way of telling you to go search for food (instead of sleeping).\n9. Hair Loss: This generally happens if you were deficient of nutrients in the first place. It is also temporary. Hair should grow back and better.\n10. Bad Breadth: This again is due to toxins released with fat. It is a temporary phenomenon and should go away once weight stabilizes.\nAll side effects discussed above are due to adaptive response of the body and generally go away within a month or two. There are some other side effects which have more to do with the weight loss which involves fat burning. These can happen even after few months and one should be aware of them.\n1. Gout Pain: When we have high levels of inflammation, the body produces uric acid,  (which is actually an antioxidant) to deal with it. So fasting can spike uric acid in some people. If you are experiencing that, do the following: (1) reduce your fruit consumption (2) eliminate alcohol (3)avoid sugar.\n2. Dr. Jason Fung mentions that there is some evidence that suggests that IF can  cause gall bladder stones. It is quite rare. Consumption of green juice should avoid this problem.",

        "content": "•Therapeutic Fasting•\nThose among us who have never fasted find it very difficult to fast for even one day. By the time it is noon one begins to feel famished and all one can think of is food. Fasting as a therapeutic tool has been used in many parts of the world over past 100 years including Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and California. An early book on the subject “The Fasting Cure” was written in US by Upton Sinclair in 1911. There are clinics  in Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and California, dedicated to curative healing by fasting.\nConsidering that we all have enough fat in our body to last us 6 or more months, have you ever wondered why do we feel famished. There are two reasons:\n(1) Firstly we have developed addiction to food  and when we do not get food in time we experience withdrawal symptoms like headaches as in any addiction.\n(2) The second reason is that although our body evolved over millions of years facing feast and famine regularly, the modern man rarely experiences famine,  and finds it very hard to deal with it even for a day. As if our body has forgotten how to burn fat.\nHaving said all that, I want to assure you that once you start practicing fasting and get over initial hurdle and the mental block, the process becomes very easy. More than 90% people report not feeling hungry, while doing prolonged fasting. I have already introduced to you the concept of intermittent fasting and many have started doing it; now we will talk about other types of fasts for therapeutic purposes.\nHOW DOES HUNGER WORK ?\nHunger has little to do with absence of food in the stomach and more to do with the release of a hormone called Ghrelin.\nGhrelin is the hunger hormone that comes in waves. It makes us hungry at the same time every day as Ghrelin rises during meal times. This is why during prolong fasting first 2 days are the most difficult.\nBENEFITS  OF  FASTING\n• Fasting reduces fat mass by going into Ketosis\n• Fasting reduces inflammation,\n• Fasting reduces triglycerides,\n• Fasting heals digestive system and guts\n• Fasting lowers insulin, that helps increase insulin sensitivity and cure diabetes\n• Fasting reduces fatty liver\n• Fasting raises human growth hormone (HGH) and releases brain derived neurotraffic  factor (BDNF). This helps in healing neurological disorders.\n• Fasting causes autophagy, which is a very powerful detoxing process where by, your body recycles waste protein within cells, dead cells, weaker cells, damaged cells and misfolded proteins. 2016  Nobel prize was awarded to Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi for his research on this subject.\n• Fasting also lowers PKA enzymes in the body which unleash the ability to form new stem cells.\n• Fasting induces detoxifying enzyme pathways. This helps detoxification processes to continue even after fasting has been discontinued.\n• Fasting helps kill cancer cells by building immunity. The 2018 Nobel prize was awarded to Dr.Honzo  for research on this subject.\n• Fasting not only slows the aging process but also reverses aging.\nFOUR PHASES OF FASTING\nFasting is a four phase process.\n(1) In the first phase your body slows down the metabolic rate and the activity level. You develop headache and experience withdrawal symptoms.\n(2) In phase two of fasting Glucogon increases which helps burn fat. Your metabolic rate increases and brain releases Alpha waves which encourage relaxation, induce a profound feeling of mental clarity and help achieve an alert state of mind. This is your brain’s way of telling you to get up and search for food.\n(3) In third phase autophagy starts and it helps clean out the dead and damaged cells.\n(4) The fourth stage is during the end of fast and when food is reintroduced. It is called the re-feeding stage. At this stage the growth in new cell’s happens. It is a very important stage for rejuvenation.\nThere are two different approaches to fasting; intermittent and prolonged.\n1. INTERMITTENT FASTING\nIn Intermittent Fasting one either reduces the eating window to a narrow window of 10 hours or less every day or does 24 hour fasts with caloric reduction (to under 500 calories) twice a week. We have already covered IF in detail under a separate heading.\n2. PROLONGED FASTING\nIn Prolonged Fasting the fasting period is stretched beyond 24 hours. On the surface it appears difficult but it really isn’t because one has already gone past the tough period of the first 24 hours. Prolonged fasting has tremendous therapeutic value. In fact it is believed that when all else fails, prolonged fasting is the treatment of last resort. It has been practiced in a few countries including Russia for many years. In California there is a clinic in Santa Rosa called “True North Health Center” where they put patients on supervised water fasts for up to 40 days. I have met the director Dr. Alan Goldhamer. They have been quite successful and work closely with Dr. John McDougall of the PBWF movement.\nDuring prolonged fasting one must follow these suggestions:\n- Add a pinch of Himalayan salt to your water.\n- Do not stress out.\n- Do whatever soothes you. Meditation can help.\n- Stay physically active and follow your typical daily regimen.\nProlonged fasting can be done in different ways with varying level of intensity:\nA. Liquid Fast:\nIn this you can consume water and clear liquid foods like juice and soups. This is truly not a fast but just a detox program.\nB. Fruits Only Fast:\nIn this, you water fast for 24 hours and then break your fast with a meal of fruits only. Many Indian religious fasts come under this category, where on the fasting day you skip breakfast and lunch and only eat dinner but that dinner is fruits only; no cereals or beans or starchy vegetables.\nC. Water Fast:\nNo food but plenty of water for 24 hours or longer. This fast can be done for long periods and is very therapeutic. The longest water only fast on record is 382 days.\nD. Dry Fast:\nNo food or water for 24 hours or longer. It is the most effective way to fast. It is two to three times more effective than water fasting. There are two types of dry fasts; soft and hard. In soft dry fast you can brush your teeth, shower and wash your hands. In hard dry fast you avoid any contact with water.\nHow to break a Fast:\nWhen breaking a fast, care should be taken to introduce food slowly. Break your fast with water, juice, fruits and a small meal, in that order.\nThose who are doing dry fasting should bracket their dry fast with water fasting on both ends. A 48 hour dry fast can be bracketed with two 12 hour water fasts making it a 72 hour fast which is as effective as a five day water only fast. This is my personal favorite.\nExtended fasting should be practiced slowly. Those who have been doing intermittent fasting will find it easy to extend fasting window to 24 hrs by skipping breakfast and lunch and eating dinner at the regular time.\nOnce you are able to do 24 hr. fast comfortably, you can skip the dinner also and eat at your regular time, breakfast or brunch (whatever is your daily routine). This way you would achieve  40 hrs fast. After that the next step would be to go for 48 hrs, 64 hrs and 72 hrs. I advise against keeping any fast longer than 72 hrs without supervision.\nWhen you are doing water only fast you would be urinating a lot and it is recommended to add some Himalayan salt to your water. That salt helps maintain the mineral balance.\nPeople who are suffering serious illnesses should consult their physicians before starting the practice of fasting.\nWhen we fast for therapeutic purposes and not for weight loss, the goal is to achieve autophagy which starts when body runs out of protein and it also typically starts after 24 hours. Fruits such as apple are the lowest in protein (only 2%). So if the fast is broken by fruits low in protein, even while breaking the fast in the evening the autophagy is maintained for another 12-16 hours till next day’s breakfast.\nPlease watch the linked videos below.👇\nA one day starvations secret that got the Nobel Prize\nhttps://youtu.be/gl8k2ncIQMc\nWorld’s largest Fasting Study (2020)",

        "content": "Hello everybody! My name is Dr Françoise Wilhelmi&nbsp; Toledo. I am the head of the research department&nbsp;&nbsp; of the Buchinger Wilhelmi clinics in Überlingen,&nbsp; South of Germany, and Marbella, South of Spain.&nbsp;&nbsp; These clinics, which are specialized in periodic&nbsp; fasting, have existed for more than 70 years and&nbsp;&nbsp; have a huge clinical experience. I have followed&nbsp; thousands of patients fasting during periods going&nbsp;&nbsp; from 5 to 20 days or more. I fast already since&nbsp; the age of 17. Some years ago, we have decided&nbsp;&nbsp; to document what we were seeing clinically for&nbsp; so many years and tried to convince people that&nbsp;&nbsp; fasting is a natural method to cure a lot of&nbsp; diseases. This started with a huge study in 2016&nbsp;&nbsp; with 1422 subjects who fasted between four and&nbsp; 20 days. They were not all overweight, there were&nbsp;&nbsp; men and women. It was a very diverse community&nbsp; and they fasted according to the programme of&nbsp;&nbsp; the Buchinger Wilhelmi clinic, which is a very&nbsp; traditional programme with three dimensions,&nbsp;&nbsp; a medical dimension community dimension and an&nbsp; emotional spiritual dimension. What we found first&nbsp;&nbsp; was that all the parameters, metabolic parameters,&nbsp; improved were modulated, were normalized&nbsp;&nbsp; tendentially. First, the weight diminished and&nbsp; especially the abdominal circumference diminished.&nbsp;&nbsp; So, you lose weight and at the right place.&nbsp; Then, the blood pressure diminished, systolic&nbsp;&nbsp; and diastolic, by people who have normal blood&nbsp; pressure as well as for those who take medication.&nbsp;&nbsp; We had to stop the intake of the medication&nbsp; or reduce the medication so that the people&nbsp;&nbsp; did not have problems. The glycaemia went down and&nbsp; normalized at the lower level of the norm and the&nbsp;&nbsp; ketone bodies in the urine were going up. So, this&nbsp; was documenting the fasting metabolic switch going&nbsp;&nbsp; from the mode of eating to the mode of fasting.&nbsp; So, what else did we observe? The blood parameters&nbsp;&nbsp; changed a lot. So we had for instance a reduction&nbsp; of the lipids in the blood, triglycerides but also&nbsp;&nbsp; LDL cholesterol. This of course a modulation.&nbsp; So, a normal person stays normal and the one who&nbsp;&nbsp; has elevated values, they correct themselves very&nbsp; quickly. We control the kidneys and liver values,&nbsp;&nbsp; which were normal. We have in another study also&nbsp; documented the fatty liver, which was able to&nbsp;&nbsp; recover and get rid of the excess fat. Maybe&nbsp; a special observation in this huge group of&nbsp;&nbsp; humans is that the sedimentation rate and other&nbsp; inflammatory parameters were diminished. This&nbsp;&nbsp; documents what many other studies in animals had&nbsp; already shown: that the inflammatory parameter,&nbsp;&nbsp; the inflammation tends to decrease during&nbsp; fasting. Another interesting confirmation of&nbsp;&nbsp; what I've seen, at least seen in shorter periods&nbsp; of fasting like intermittent fasting or every&nbsp;&nbsp; other day fasting and also in animal models, is&nbsp; that the blood cells are reduced, probably due&nbsp;&nbsp; to autophagy and apoptosis. This is a phenomenon&nbsp; that leads during fasting to the elimination of&nbsp;&nbsp; old structures or all cells which are senescent.&nbsp; Damaged structures can be self digested and&nbsp;&nbsp; partially recycled. Then after fasting: We always&nbsp; have asked the people to stay at least four&nbsp;&nbsp; to five days in the setting to refeed, to get&nbsp; through the period after the fasting where you&nbsp;&nbsp; slowly reintroduce the food. This is a wonderful&nbsp; period anyway because your taste buds are renewed&nbsp;&nbsp; and you enjoy the food, even the simplest food is&nbsp; a real feast. But at the same time we know that&nbsp;&nbsp; cells regenerate, tissues regenerate, rejuvenate&nbsp; because there has been an activation of stem cells&nbsp;&nbsp; during the fasting and now they are coming out and&nbsp; renewing the pool of cells of tissues organs and&nbsp;&nbsp; especially the immune cells in the blood. We had&nbsp; also subjects having special conditions in this&nbsp;&nbsp; group. The healthy people went for preventive&nbsp; reasons but about 500 had a special condition.&nbsp;&nbsp; These conditions can be divided into three&nbsp; groups more or less: the ones who have metabolic&nbsp;&nbsp; problems i.e. high blood pressure, Diabetes type&nbsp; 2, hyperlipidemia, cholesterolemia, all risk&nbsp;&nbsp; factors for cardiovascular diseases; another group&nbsp; are the chronic inflammatory diseases, i.e. people&nbsp;&nbsp; coming for their arthritis, for polyarthritis,&nbsp; for gastritis, conditions of the digestive system,&nbsp;&nbsp; skin problems, neurodermatitis, fibromyalgia,&nbsp; they all come; and then the third group would&nbsp;&nbsp; be pre-burnout, depressive moods, people having a&nbsp; state of exhaustion psychologically or physically.&nbsp;&nbsp; 85% documented a subjective huge improvement.&nbsp; Some had more or less the same results. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; this is the first study with a very large cohort&nbsp; using a method that is traditional, which has been&nbsp;&nbsp; used seventy years long under medical supervision&nbsp; within a very beautiful context, nature,&nbsp;&nbsp; an activity program, a teaching program. Also, the&nbsp; people after fasting can go to better life habits.&nbsp;&nbsp; We pay close attention to accompanying people and&nbsp; providing a synergetic programme. So, this is a&nbsp;&nbsp; study published in PLOS ONE in January 2019 and of&nbsp; course, we would be happy if this study is giving&nbsp;&nbsp; you the taste of fasting and, because you know&nbsp; you have it in your genes, the programme is in&nbsp;&nbsp; yourself, you just have to have the right setting&nbsp; and good guidance. If you have an illness, you&nbsp;&nbsp; have to be under medical supervision and you can&nbsp; really discover one thing: fasting is enjoyable!&nbsp;&nbsp; Yes, you heard right. We have documented also the&nbsp; well-being and from the first day to the last day,&nbsp;&nbsp; you can see an improvement of the emotional&nbsp; as well as the physical well-being. So,&nbsp;&nbsp; it's exactly the contrary of what people would&nbsp; think. They would think maybe that you feel tired,&nbsp;&nbsp; you feel bad, you are hungry. We notice also&nbsp; that ninety-three per cent of the people didn't&nbsp;&nbsp; feel hungry after some hours and this is exactly&nbsp; what we would expect, you would expect so that&nbsp;&nbsp; we really encourage you to give it a try and I'm&nbsp; sure, when you have rediscovered this programme&nbsp;&nbsp; and this ability in yourself, then you will use&nbsp; it regularly. We recommend to fast periodic every&nbsp;&nbsp; year and then maybe one or two days per week if&nbsp; it's necessary, and some hours a day so to have&nbsp;&nbsp; a long pause in the food intake. This would be&nbsp; intermittent fasting for instance. But you can&nbsp;&nbsp; use other nutritional strategies and if you&nbsp; are healthy and have a normal weight then&nbsp;&nbsp; you can just do periodic fasting. The very nice&nbsp; thing about it - it's only a possibility for an&nbsp;&nbsp; adult - to regenerate yourselves and your tissues&nbsp; to rejuvenate them. So, it would be crazy not to&nbsp;&nbsp; use that ability. Thank you very much for&nbsp; watching this video and just do it, fast!",

        "content": "•• 8 Stages of Fasting ••\nEvery cell in the human body is genetically programmed for two main functions (1) self preservation and (2) procreation.\nDuring plenty of food (fed state), it is less worried about preservation and it is preoccupied with procreation. It is very similar to human behavior; which truly is just the composite of 30 trillion cell’s behavior. During shortage of food body’s focus shifts to preservation.\nThe first thing to run out is sugar which is stored as glycogen in muscles and liver. The total storage capacity is 500 grams (2,000 calories), 100 in liver and 400 in muscles. This usually takes about 12 hours to exhaust. When body runs out of sugar in liver, it starts to convert fat into ketone bodies to provide energy to the brain. This stage is called ketosis. The body can stay in ketosis for a very long time and the longest record for water fasting is 382 days.\nWhen body runs out of protein, it begins to recycle the waste protein sitting inside each cell’s trash can (lysosome) and recycles it into amino acids (which are the building blocks of protein). After some time the body begins to recycle the dead and damaged cells for protein. The process also extends to Senescent cells which are not quite dead but have stopped reproducing.\nThe body goes through various stages; some of which are a step curve as in intermittent fasting but others lie on a continuum. Also, when a stage is triggered, is a function of meal (or two) before you start fasting. If the last meal was low in carbs the metabolic shift to ketosis would happen sooner. If the last meal was low in protein the autophagy would trigger earlier.\nThe following describes the various stages human body goes through while fasting. The gap in hours is only an approximation as actual would vary from individual to individual, depending upon their gut microbiome and content of the meals prior to fasting.\n(1) 12 hrs: Ketosis: As glycogen in the liver is exhausted, the metabolic pathway shifts to fat burning mode called Ketosis. During ketosis the fat from fat cells is released to provide fuel for the body, as liver converts these fat cells into ketone bodies to provide energy to the brain. During this stage the metabolic rate increases as if body is nudging you to go find food. This is what is typically achieved during daily Intermittent fasting. The higher metabolic rate helps lose excess fat.\n(2) 18 hrs: As ketone bodies level in the blood rises, it signals the body to ramp up stress busting pathways to reduce inflammation and repair DNA damage.\n(3) 24 hrs: Autophagy (Intracellular): At 24 hours cells start recycling protein waste kept in a trash container inside every cell (called lysosome).\n(4) 36 hrs: Autophagy (Intercellular): As further time passes the body also begins to recycle damaged cells like senescent cells and misfolded proteins.\n(5) 48 hrs: Growth Hormones reach the highest levels (almost 5 times as high as before the fast). This is because hunger hormone Ghrelin promotes the growth hormone secretion.\n(6) 54 hrs: Insulin levels drop to the lowest point. The body becomes more insulin sensitive.\n(7) 72 hrs: Breakdown of old immune cells and generation  of new ones. Helps build cancer immunity. During this stage (as per Dr. Valter Longo of USC) cancer cells are weakened and more susceptible to chemotherapy while normal cells become more resistant to chemo therapy.\n(8) Refeeding Stage: This stage is very important and often misunderstood. The refeeding should be done slowly and some suggest that food should be gradually increased to normal levels over a duration half as long as the fasting period. More research is needed in this area as human studies to date are quite limited.\nWhen human body is deprived of Autophagy by staying for ever in fed state, the neurons cells in the brain get damaged causing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and others. It is for these reasons the experts like Dr. Tasuku Honzo and Dr. James P. Allison recommend that one should do a 10 day prolonged fast each year. It does not have to be water only fast; one can eat one meal a day of under 500 calories. It helps if the meals are light on protein as protein deficiency is the main cause of therapeutic benefits. It so happens that there is a custom in many cultures to observe such fasts. Navratri among Hindus and Ramdan among Muslims. Unfortunately to avoid discomfort people have started making too many concessions which negate the benefits of such fasts.",

        "content": "••• NAVRATRI FAST •••\nIn most cultures it is believed that there are demons (negative tendencies) within us which make us do the wrong and evil. Navratri is the nine days period when we fight and defeat these demons within us. Exemplified in victory of Ram over 10 headed Ravan or 9 visits by Mother Durga to our homes to kill these demons within us. Dash-hara means to concur the 10 (demons). Our ancestors had beautifully tied the wisdom of their knowledge through religious strings to increase compliance.\nThe modern science is only catching up to what our ancestors knew intuitively. It was only in year 2016 and 2018 that Nobel prizes were awarded to scientists who demonstrated how and why fasting is so therapeutic. First a note about the demons we are trying to eliminate:\n1. Ahankar: Ego, Pride\n2. Kam (Vasana): Lust\n3. Krodh: Wrath, Anger\n4. Mada: Stubbornly\n5. Lobha: Greed, Selfishness\n6. Moha: Attachment, Delusion\n7. Amanavta: Inhumane Behavior, Cruelty\n8. Anyaya: Injustice\n9. Matsara: Envy (Jealousy)\n10. Swarth: Moha: Attachment, Delusion\n11. Sloth: Laziness\n12. Gluttony\nThe list varies slightly from culture to culture but the idea is the same. Fasting achieves it very well and in various ways by rejuvenating body, mind and intellect.\nOne’s main goal during Navratri fast is to to create a caloric deficiency and protein deficiency for an extended period of time so that the body can derive the benefits of autophagy and cleans itself of waste protein, misfolded proteins, damaged cells, dead cells and senescent cells. Ideally the fast should be done without any food as it is practiced among Jains called Paryushan  8-Day fast. But that is a bit more difficult for most people to follow. Here are the guidelines for meal during Navratri fasting.\n1. One meal a day (OMAD) only. Have it in the early evening.\n2. The total calories should be 500 or less.\n3. During fasting window of 23 hours consume only water. Avoid any tea or coffee or any other beverages. Take any beverage only during the eating window of one hour including coconut water.\n4. Avoid food which are rich in protein (as a % of total calories).\n5. Avoid foods from the grains and legumes groups as they are rich in protein.\n6. Predominantly eat from fruits and vegetable groups. Their caloric density is low, so they fill up stomach without exceeding total calories.\n7. Within the fruits and vegetables group look for foods which are low in protein. For example apples are better than guavas.\n8. Nuts and Seeds group is okay but in smaller quantities. Have a spoon of flax, Chia or hemp seed to ensure you get your omega-3.\nIn this process of Navratri fast, you will lose some weight but that is not the primary purpose of Navratri fast. If weight loss bothers you, you can gain it right back upon completion of the 9 day fast by going back to regular diet.",

this subject cover this subject cover this subject and then i and then i and then i i realized that a lot of people have i realized that a lot of people have i realized that a lot of people have a lot of misunderstandings about about what this fast is all about what this fast is all about what this fast is all about how to keep the fast how to break the how to keep the fast how to break the how to keep the fast how to break the fast and so on so i decided to do this talk to clarify so i decided to do this talk to clarify some of the things some of the things some of the things if you go to youtube and watch if you go to youtube and watch if you go to youtube and watch many videos many videos many videos on navratri fast they are very misleading they are very misleading in fact i came across in fact i came across in fact i came across some some some recommended diets recommended diets recommended diets for navratri fast which included six for navratri fast which included six for navratri fast which included six meals from seven in the morning meals from seven in the morning meals from seven in the morning till nine at night and then the lady said and then the lady said in case you feel hungry in case you feel hungry in case you feel hungry in between the in between the in between the meals you can always have another fruit meals you can always have another fruit meals you can always have another fruit or a glass of milk which has which has a caloric value which provides energy fasting requires us fasting requires us not to consume not to consume not to consume anything anything anything but but but water thousands of years ago we were not thousands of years ago we were not drinking tea and coffee drinking tea and coffee drinking tea and coffee so our so our so our ancestors did not mention anything about ancestors did not mention anything about ancestors did not mention anything about tea and coffee tea and coffee tea and coffee and many people have and many people have and many people have somehow adapted tea and coffee as if it somehow adapted tea and coffee as if it somehow adapted tea and coffee as if it is normal is normal is normal to have tea and coffee to have tea and coffee to have tea and coffee during fast during fast during fast it is not it is not it is not the idea is to give your body complete the idea is to give your body complete the idea is to give your body complete rest and and body should not be secreting any fluids body should not be secreting any fluids body should not be secreting any fluids that it does whether it is that it does whether it is that it does whether it is in your stomach or in your pancreas in your stomach or in your pancreas in your stomach or in your pancreas there should not be any activity that there should not be any activity that there should not be any activity that initiates initiates initiates such fluid secretion so the only way to do fast is so the only way to do fast is by not consuming by not consuming by not consuming anything anything anything and putting few drops of lemon and putting few drops of lemon and putting few drops of lemon makes it make doesn't make it any better makes it make doesn't make it any better makes it make doesn't make it any better so you have to ask your question so you have to ask your question so you have to ask your question why am i putting these few drops of why am i putting these few drops of why am i putting these few drops of lemon unless you don't like the taste of lemon unless you don't like the taste of lemon unless you don't like the taste of water and you can't fast water and you can't fast water and you can't fast without those few drops of lemon please don't do that please don't do that okay okay okay so let's let's talk about what navratri so let's let's talk about what navratri so let's let's talk about what navratri is all about first is all about first is all about first and and then we'll discuss and and then we'll discuss and and then we'll discuss how to do navrati fast and other things how to do navrati fast and other things how to do navrati fast and other things so navratri so navratri so navratri is is is as we as we as we say that say that say that ma durga ma durga ma durga comes every night in a different form to kill to kill one of the demons one of the demons one of the demons so who are these demons so who are these demons so who are these demons these demons are within us and let's go these demons are within us and let's go these demons are within us and let's go to slide second all right all right so here i have listed nine demons so here i have listed nine demons so here i have listed nine demons that we are trying to conquer these demons are within us these demons are within us they have become part of our nature they have become part of our nature they have become part of our nature lust lust lust anger anger anger greed greed greed pride pride pride envy envy envy gluteny gluteny gluteny sloth sloth sloth wrath and delusion wrath and delusion wrath and delusion this list varies from culture to culture this list varies from culture to culture this list varies from culture to culture but in many cultures but in many cultures but in many cultures they have some activities planned during year planned during year to win to win to win these demons within us now we know and the science has now we know and the science has demonstrated it live the normal life live the normal life consume the food that we do consume consume the food that we do consume consume the food that we do consume our body our body our body creates creates creates toxins and waste and waste now some of this waste we remove by now some of this waste we remove by now some of this waste we remove by going to toilet every day and going to toilet every day and going to toilet every day and urinating and taking showers and taking showers externally but there are other toxins which remain but there are other toxins which remain in our body in our body in our body body metabolizes when it body metabolizes when it body metabolizes when it does to the food what it needs to do it creates byproducts it creates byproducts these byproducts our body has 30 trillion cells and each our body has 30 trillion cells and each cell cell cell needs two things only needs two things only needs two things only it needs nutrition it needs nutrition it needs nutrition and then it needs to poop out that's that's the one activity that's that's the one activity and the second is it and the second is it and the second is it procreates procreates procreates it multiplies it multiplies it multiplies and creates and creates and creates more cells let's call them more cells let's call them more cells let's call them the cells the cells the cells children so all children so all children so all all cells almost all cells the few cells all cells almost all cells the few cells all cells almost all cells the few cells which do not do that which do not do that which do not do that like retina of our eye like retina of our eye like retina of our eye or not the retina but the cell of our or not the retina but the cell of our or not the retina but the cell of our eye but very few otherwise all cells eye but very few otherwise all cells eye but very few otherwise all cells have only two purpose in life one to have only two purpose in life one to have only two purpose in life one to survive survive survive and second and second and second to procreate to multiply it creates certain toxins it creates certain toxins certain proteins it creates which are certain proteins it creates which are certain proteins it creates which are the byproduct and and some of these get detoxified they get some of these get detoxified they get some of these get detoxified they get removed removed removed through our lymphatic system through our lymphatic system through our lymphatic system our body we have two systems we have a our body we have two systems we have a our body we have two systems we have a blood circulation system blood circulation system blood circulation system which provides nutrients to every cell which provides nutrients to every cell which provides nutrients to every cell and then we have a lymphatic system and then we have a lymphatic system and then we have a lymphatic system which removes which removes which removes the garbage the garbage the garbage the toxins the toxins the toxins you all know that if you're you all know that if you're you all know that if you're if there is a strike if there is a strike if there is a strike and and garbage is not being removed and garbage is not being removed it can make your life miserable it can make your life miserable it can make your life miserable just imagine the time when there were no just imagine the time when there were no just imagine the time when there were no flush toilets at least these days flush toilets at least these days flush toilets at least these days flush toilets keep working flush toilets keep working flush toilets keep working but imagine the time when there were no but imagine the time when there were no but imagine the time when there were no flush toilets flush toilets flush toilets if if if if there was a strike if there was a strike if there was a strike by janitors by janitors by janitors it will make your life miserable similarly similarly if we do not remove the toxins from our if we do not remove the toxins from our if we do not remove the toxins from our body body body the body's life can become miserable the body's life can become miserable the body's life can become miserable and the body can die also and the body can die also and the body can die also so fasting is a way so fasting is a way so fasting is a way to remove those toxins which otherwise to remove those toxins which otherwise to remove those toxins which otherwise don't get removed don't get removed don't get removed through the normal body processes through the normal body processes through the normal body processes of going to toilet urinating taking of going to toilet urinating taking of going to toilet urinating taking shower and sweating it is for this reason it is for this reason in our culture in our culture in our culture they have they have they have prescribed fasting prescribed fasting prescribed fasting every two weeks every two weeks every two weeks we call it a kadashi fast we call it a kadashi fast we call it a kadashi fast if we fast every two weeks if we fast every two weeks if we fast every two weeks the body gets to the body gets to the body gets to remove the toxins which were not removed remove the toxins which were not removed remove the toxins which were not removed on the daily fashion the akashi fast involves the akashi fast involves keeping whole day fast keeping whole day fast keeping whole day fast after dinner on the first night you keep after dinner on the first night you keep after dinner on the first night you keep fast on the whole day the next day fast on the whole day the next day fast on the whole day the next day and then day after the next day you and then day after the next day you and then day after the next day you consume your normal breakfast consume your normal breakfast consume your normal breakfast so it becomes a 36 hour fast now now no rather fast is a nine day fast no rather fast is a nine day fast no rather fast is a nine day fast which which which we do we do we do when the season changes when the season changes when the season changes when the crop has been harvested when the crop has been harvested when the crop has been harvested and the season has changed is changing and the season has changed is changing and the season has changed is changing people have time they people have time they people have time they they have harvested the crops they have harvested the crops they have harvested the crops successfully and the next crop has not successfully and the next crop has not successfully and the next crop has not yet started yet started yet started so they have some time to relax so they have some time to relax so they have some time to relax and and take it easy and that's why the and and take it easy and that's why the and and take it easy and that's why the fast is fast is fast is recommended during the month of april recommended during the month of april recommended during the month of april and during the month of october okay okay i normally i normally i normally cover the subject of health in a two-month in a two-month course and course and course and many of you many of you many of you have been part of my health group some have been part of my health group some have been part of my health group some of you may not of you may not of you may not so i just wanted to explain that there so i just wanted to explain that there so i just wanted to explain that there are five pillars of life of health are five pillars of life of health are five pillars of life of health and food is first pillar of health and food is first pillar of health and food is first pillar of health but detoxification is the second but detoxification is the second but detoxification is the second most important most important most important process that we need to do process that we need to do process that we need to do and and navratri fast and and navratri fast and and navratri fast and a kadashi fast and a kadashi fast and a kadashi fast they both relate to detoxification one other thing that we recommend in one other thing that we recommend in my courses my courses my courses is that we do a daily fast do a daily fast of 16 hours we try and consume all our of 16 hours we try and consume all our of 16 hours we try and consume all our food food food in a narrow 8-hour eating window in a narrow 8-hour eating window in a narrow 8-hour eating window this is how we evolved this is how we evolved this is how we evolved millions of years ago millions of years ago millions of years ago there were no refrigerators there were there were no refrigerators there were there were no refrigerators there were no storage no storage no storage we used to move from one place to we used to move from one place to we used to move from one place to another and in the morning when we got up and in the morning when we got up there was no food to consume we there was no food to consume we there was no food to consume we went out looking for food went out looking for food went out looking for food ladies and children went picking fruits ladies and children went picking fruits ladies and children went picking fruits from trees from trees from trees men went looking for maybe men went looking for maybe men went looking for maybe some leftover meat some leftover meat some leftover meat that a that a that a tiger or lime or any other predator may tiger or lime or any other predator may tiger or lime or any other predator may have have have left left left the previous night the previous night the previous night we were mostly scavengers we were mostly scavengers we were mostly scavengers we did catch some small we did catch some small we did catch some small hunt like a chicken or a rabbit hunt like a chicken or a rabbit hunt like a chicken or a rabbit when we came back it was probably 10 30 when we came back it was probably 10 30 when we came back it was probably 10 30 11 o'clock anyway 11 o'clock anyway 11 o'clock anyway and then we and then we and then we cooked a meal and we had supper in the evening in the evening we tried to finish our meal before it we tried to finish our meal before it we tried to finish our meal before it got dark got dark got dark because we didn't have because we didn't have because we didn't have light or candles candles came much later and and even 150 years ago even 150 years ago even 150 years ago people tried to finish their people tried to finish their people tried to finish their kitchen functions before it got dark kitchen functions before it got dark kitchen functions before it got dark outside so eating was done by six o'clock so eating was done by six o'clock latest and and jan people have a custom which is called jan people have a custom which is called jan people have a custom which is called chauvihar chauvihar chauvihar chauvihar meaning that you don't eat chauvihar meaning that you don't eat chauvihar meaning that you don't eat anything after you have finished dinner anything after you have finished dinner anything after you have finished dinner and you try and finish your dinner and you try and finish your dinner and you try and finish your dinner around the sunset time around the sunset time around the sunset time and then next morning and then next morning and then next morning till next morning you don't consume till next morning you don't consume till next morning you don't consume anything anything anything so our body evolved so our body evolved so our body evolved on a 24 hour on a 24 hour on a 24 hour circadian rhythm 12 hours of daylight circadian rhythm 12 hours of daylight circadian rhythm 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours and 12 hours and 12 hours of night somehow after the invention of somehow after the invention of electricity electricity electricity we have we have we have forgotten about that custom forgotten about that custom forgotten about that custom and now and now and now we we we keep eating keep eating keep eating till late at night and especially in till late at night and especially in till late at night and especially in india there's a very bad habit india there's a very bad habit india there's a very bad habit of having dinners at nine o'clock or ten of having dinners at nine o'clock or ten of having dinners at nine o'clock or ten o'clock o'clock o'clock and when people go out to eat they're and when people go out to eat they're and when people go out to eat they're eating dinner at 11 or even midnight eating dinner at 11 or even midnight eating dinner at 11 or even midnight most weddings they don't serve most weddings they don't serve most weddings they don't serve dinner till 11 o'clock dinner till 11 o'clock dinner till 11 o'clock our body was not designed for that our body was not designed for that our body was not designed for that our body gets confused when it receives our body gets confused when it receives our body gets confused when it receives food after it is dark outside food after it is dark outside food after it is dark outside body knows when it is body knows when it is body knows when it is daytime daytime daytime in the morning when we receive blue in the morning when we receive blue in the morning when we receive blue light light light reflected from the sky reflected from the sky reflected from the sky our body knows it's the morning time our body knows it's the morning time our body knows it's the morning time and certain hormones are released and certain hormones are released and certain hormones are released at that time cortisol hormones which are at that time cortisol hormones which are at that time cortisol hormones which are the hormones that make you the hormones that make you the hormones that make you get up and go get up and go get up and go and some other hormones and some other hormones and some other hormones decline in the morning like melatonin decline in the morning like melatonin decline in the morning like melatonin it rises in the evening after sunset it rises in the evening after sunset it rises in the evening after sunset and it is a hormone that calms you down and it is a hormone that calms you down and it is a hormone that calms you down and makes you go to sleep and makes you go to sleep and makes you go to sleep so when you keep eating food beyond so when you keep eating food beyond so when you keep eating food beyond darkness your body gets confused says what's your body gets confused says what's going on i thought the day was over going on i thought the day was over going on i thought the day was over i guess not i guess not i guess not so the hormones it was supposed to so the hormones it was supposed to so the hormones it was supposed to release it may put a hold on them release it may put a hold on them release it may put a hold on them and the hormones it was supposed to stop and the hormones it was supposed to stop and the hormones it was supposed to stop releasing it may continue releasing them releasing it may continue releasing them releasing it may continue releasing them so so so we have known about it for some time we have known about it for some time we have known about it for some time circadian rhythm but in 2017 a nobel prize was given but in 2017 a nobel prize was given to scientists who demonstrated to scientists who demonstrated to scientists who demonstrated how our body's circadian clock works how our body's circadian clock works how our body's circadian clock works we have a clock in our mind we have a clock in our mind we have a clock in our mind in our brain in our brain in our brain where hypothalamus is under the where hypothalamus is under the where hypothalamus is under the hypothalamus we have a master clock hypothalamus we have a master clock hypothalamus we have a master clock and that master clock tunes tunes all other clocks all other clocks all other clocks every cell has a clock so every every cell has a clock so every every cell has a clock so every cell out of 30 trillion cells cell out of 30 trillion cells cell out of 30 trillion cells has a clock has a clock has a clock which is embedded in our gene and we have a gene and we have a gene is called period gene and it's the is the gene that dictates and it's the is the gene that dictates the clock the clock the clock in each cell in each cell in each cell it it it creates a protein called or protein gets created in the night or protein gets created in the night time time time and in the morning that protein and in the morning that protein and in the morning that protein is slowly spent is slowly spent is slowly spent till it runs out till it runs out till it runs out so we have a circadian rhythm we have so we have a circadian rhythm we have so we have a circadian rhythm we have been been been learning more and more about it learning more and more about it learning more and more about it and and and it is important for good health it is important for good health it is important for good health to be in sync to be in sync to be in sync with the nature's clock so circadian with the nature's clock so circadian with the nature's clock so circadian clock clock clock in our hypothalamus needs to be in our hypothalamus needs to be in our hypothalamus needs to be synchronized synchronized synchronized with the nature's clock with the nature's clock with the nature's clock and it is for that reason it is and it is for that reason it is and it is for that reason it is important that we finish our dinner important that we finish our dinner important that we finish our dinner before it is dark before it is dark before it is dark and stop eating anything beyond that so and stop eating anything beyond that so and stop eating anything beyond that so this daily process of fasting this daily process of fasting this daily process of fasting for 12 for 12 for 12 or more hours or more hours or more hours is very important for good health so they are we're talking about three so they are we're talking about three types of fasting here types of fasting here types of fasting here one is the daily fasting which we call one is the daily fasting which we call one is the daily fasting which we call intermittent fasting intermittent fasting intermittent fasting try to consume all your food in eight try to consume all your food in eight try to consume all your food in eight hour window preferably hour window preferably hour window preferably but ten hours is also fine especially if but ten hours is also fine especially if but ten hours is also fine especially if you are unwell if you are ill with you are unwell if you are ill with you are unwell if you are ill with hypertension or diabetes or cholesterol hypertension or diabetes or cholesterol hypertension or diabetes or cholesterol or asthma or asthma or asthma or arthritis or any chronic disease then or arthritis or any chronic disease then or arthritis or any chronic disease then you should try to reduce your eating you should try to reduce your eating you should try to reduce your eating window to eight hours window to eight hours window to eight hours and that is and that is and that is known as intermittent fasting known as intermittent fasting known as intermittent fasting okay okay okay so we discussed these things i covered so we discussed these things i covered so we discussed these things i covered the subject because there are some new the subject because there are some new the subject because there are some new people in this audience people in this audience people in this audience let's move to the next slide rakesh all right we'll all right we'll other factors for good health are other factors for good health are other factors for good health are emotional health emotional health emotional health and spiritual health and spiritual health and spiritual health so these are the five pillars of health so these are the five pillars of health so these are the five pillars of health all five are very important all five are very important all five are very important when we do not detoxify our when we do not detoxify our when we do not detoxify our brain properly brain properly brain properly it can lead to some emotional it can lead to some emotional it can lead to some emotional stress stress stress and there are many diseases which are and there are many diseases which are and there are many diseases which are caused caused caused because of lack of detoxification our brain our brain releases a certain protein a certain protein as a byproduct called beta as a byproduct called beta as a byproduct called beta amyloid amyloid amyloid and these proteins if they are not and these proteins if they are not and these proteins if they are not removed regularly which happens during deep sleep process which happens during deep sleep process so when you go to deep sleep your mind so when you go to deep sleep your mind so when you go to deep sleep your mind your brain flushes these your brain flushes these your brain flushes these beta amyloids beta amyloids beta amyloids and pushes them into and pushes them into and pushes them into a lymphatic system a lymphatic system a lymphatic system but if you are not getting proper deep but if you are not getting proper deep but if you are not getting proper deep sleep these beta amyloids sleep these beta amyloids sleep these beta amyloids clog together clog together clog together and and and like plaque we talk about plaque and like plaque we talk about plaque and like plaque we talk about plaque and blood vessels there is a plaque blood vessels there is a plaque blood vessels there is a plaque in brain also and these things lead to in brain also and these things lead to in brain also and these things lead to diseases like diseases like diseases like dementia alzheimer's dementia alzheimer's dementia alzheimer's and parkinson's disease which are and parkinson's disease which are and parkinson's disease which are diseases of our diseases of our diseases of our of our brain of our brain of our brain so so so fasting during fasting during fasting during navratri navratri navratri does a great job does a great job does a great job of detoxifying every cell in our body of detoxifying every cell in our body of detoxifying every cell in our body and we'll talk about it shortly let's and we'll talk about it shortly let's and we'll talk about it shortly let's move move move to the next slide to the next slide to the next slide okay for for the benefit of those who okay for for the benefit of those who okay for for the benefit of those who have not been part of my group one thing we emphasize is that one thing we emphasize is that the food should only be consumed the food should only be consumed the food should only be consumed in an unrefined in an unrefined in an unrefined and unprocessed form and unprocessed form and unprocessed form so the question comes up what is the so the question comes up what is the so the question comes up what is the difference between a processed and difference between a processed and difference between a processed and refined food refined food refined food and i have taken example here to and i have taken example here to and i have taken example here to communicate that point communicate that point communicate that point and when you eat corn and when you eat corn and when you eat corn corn on the cob is the least refined corn on the cob is the least refined corn on the cob is the least refined food it's the natural form food it's the natural form food it's the natural form you take those corn kernels corn kernels and freeze them and then you make corn and freeze them and then you make corn and freeze them and then you make corn soup soup soup it is still in a whole form freezing it is still in a whole form freezing it is still in a whole form freezing itself is not bad then you then you take take take dry corn dry corn dry corn and you make a meal out of that that's and you make a meal out of that that's and you make a meal out of that that's corn meal you process a little more corn meal you process a little more corn meal you process a little more you become corn flour you become corn flour you become corn flour corn process more becomes corn starch corn process more becomes corn starch corn process more becomes corn starch you heat it you heat it you heat it they used to heat it in sand they used to heat it in sand they used to heat it in sand you can heat it in micro wave and it you can heat it in micro wave and it you can heat it in micro wave and it becomes popcorn becomes popcorn becomes popcorn so everything on this side of this so everything on this side of this so everything on this side of this table table table is whole food it's just slightly more is whole food it's just slightly more is whole food it's just slightly more processed from the previous category processed from the previous category processed from the previous category but on the right side when you look at but on the right side when you look at but on the right side when you look at corn flakes corn flakes corn flakes it is highly processed corn flakes is it is highly processed corn flakes is it is highly processed corn flakes is what you consume for breakfast what you consume for breakfast what you consume for breakfast mr kellogg invented cornflakes mr kellogg invented cornflakes mr kellogg invented cornflakes and that was almost 100 years ago and that was almost 100 years ago and that was almost 100 years ago and then he and then he and then he asked everybody to eat corn flakes for asked everybody to eat corn flakes for asked everybody to eat corn flakes for breakfast breakfast breakfast and his secretary and his secretary and his secretary who was probably the first dietitian in a in an interview with a in a in an interview with a magazine magazine magazine made a comment that breakfast is the most important that breakfast is the most important meal of the day meal of the day meal of the day of course she was trying to push the of course she was trying to push the of course she was trying to push the product product product her boss made her boss made her boss made and that's how that line came and that's how that line came and that's how that line came into our into our into our vocabulary vocabulary vocabulary and you see a lot of people saying and you see a lot of people saying and you see a lot of people saying breakfast is the most important meal of breakfast is the most important meal of breakfast is the most important meal of the day the day the day it is not it is not it is not it is not necessary to have a meal at it is not necessary to have a meal at it is not necessary to have a meal at seven o'clock in the morning or eight seven o'clock in the morning or eight seven o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock o'clock in the morning or nine o'clock in the morning it is it is not necessary at all not necessary at all not necessary at all and you can take your first meal and you can take your first meal and you can take your first meal at 10 o'clock or 11 or even at noon time at 10 o'clock or 11 or even at noon time at 10 o'clock or 11 or even at noon time it's perfectly healthy and normal anyway it's perfectly healthy and normal anyway it's perfectly healthy and normal anyway so coming back to so coming back to so coming back to the processed food corn oil is refined the processed food corn oil is refined the processed food corn oil is refined food food food when you make corn oil you remove all when you make corn oil you remove all when you make corn oil you remove all the fiber the fiber the fiber so the fiber has been removed so the fiber has been removed so the fiber has been removed and one should not consume any oil and one should not consume any oil and one should not consume any oil whatsoever in a plant-based whole food in a plant-based whole food diet diet diet you can have you can have you can have peanuts but not peanut oil you can have peanuts but not peanut oil you can have peanuts but not peanut oil you can have mustard seeds but not mustard oil you mustard seeds but not mustard oil you mustard seeds but not mustard oil you can have corn can have corn can have corn but not corn oil but not corn oil but not corn oil another product made out of corn is high another product made out of corn is high another product made out of corn is high fructose corn syrup fructose corn syrup fructose corn syrup which is even more processed than corn which is even more processed than corn which is even more processed than corn oil oil oil it's very inexpensive and it's very it's very inexpensive and it's very it's very inexpensive and it's very sweet sweet sweet corn has a lot of sweetness a lot of corn has a lot of sweetness a lot of corn has a lot of sweetness a lot of sugar in it sugar in it sugar in it and high fructose corn syrup is used and high fructose corn syrup is used and high fructose corn syrup is used to sweeten everything everything you buy to sweeten everything everything you buy to sweeten everything everything you buy in a grocery store in a grocery store in a grocery store and all the soft drinks use high and all the soft drinks use high and all the soft drinks use high fructose corn syrup fructose corn syrup fructose corn syrup so i wanted to make a point that to live so i wanted to make a point that to live so i wanted to make a point that to live healthy healthy healthy you want to consume food you want to consume food you want to consume food in its whole form in its whole form in its whole form and as close to natural form as you can and as close to natural form as you can and as close to natural form as you can any processes that you can do with your any processes that you can do with your any processes that you can do with your hand that our ancestors must have also hand that our ancestors must have also hand that our ancestors must have also done like peeling done like peeling done like peeling slicing dicing mesh meshing slicing dicing mesh meshing slicing dicing mesh meshing they all are okay they all are okay they all are okay but processes which but processes which but processes which could not be done by you could not be done by you could not be done by you using using using primitive tools primitive tools primitive tools should be avoided i'm not saying you should be avoided i'm not saying you should be avoided i'm not saying you don't use modern tools don't use modern tools don't use modern tools but only use modern tools which achieve but only use modern tools which achieve but only use modern tools which achieve processes which you could do otherwise processes which you could do otherwise processes which you could do otherwise as well so yes you can use blenders all right so a just a small uh lesson on all right so a just a small uh lesson on what one should normally eat for healthy what one should normally eat for healthy what one should normally eat for healthy living let's move on to the next slide living let's move on to the next slide living let's move on to the next slide please okay in this slide i'm showing how okay in this slide i'm showing how a typical a typical a typical indian family indian family indian family which calls itself a vegetarian the

people would even have a and then some people would even have a glass of milk before going to bed in this in this as you can see on the right hand as you can see on the right hand as you can see on the right hand of your of your of your of this slide of this slide of this slide almost almost almost 20 to 50 percent of the calories are 20 to 50 percent of the calories are 20 to 50 percent of the calories are coming from ghee oil and sugar coming from ghee oil and sugar coming from ghee oil and sugar and another ten to twenty percent from and another ten to twenty percent from and another ten to twenty percent from dairy dairy dairy now dairy is also very unhealthy now dairy is also very unhealthy now dairy is also very unhealthy and we spend two three days discussing and we spend two three days discussing and we spend two three days discussing it as a part of the course you know all mammals if you look around you know all mammals if you look around nurse their nurse their nurse their newborn newborn newborn only a few months only a few months only a few months and once the newborn and once the newborn and once the newborn has its own teeth its own teeth they wean them they wean them they wean them and and and then the child never consumes mother's then the child never consumes mother's then the child never consumes mother's milk milk milk after that initial period of after that initial period of after that initial period of three months or six months that continue to feed our children milk that continue to feed our children milk after we have weaned after we have weaned after we have weaned the child from mother's milk the child from mother's milk the child from mother's milk the other observation is that no other the other observation is that no other the other observation is that no other mammal drinks mammal drinks mammal drinks some other species milk they only drink some other species milk they only drink some other species milk they only drink their mother's milk their mother's milk their mother's milk but we are the we are the only mammals but we are the we are the only mammals but we are the we are the only mammals that we drink other species milk cows that we drink other species milk cows that we drink other species milk cows milk milk milk buffaloes milk goat's milk buffaloes milk goat's milk buffaloes milk goat's milk camel's milk camel's milk camel's milk it's a very unhealthy practice we have it's a very unhealthy practice we have it's a very unhealthy practice we have adopted adopted adopted and a source of many problems and a source of many problems and a source of many problems the research has shown the research has shown the research has shown that the protein in milk in cow's milk that the protein in milk in cow's milk that the protein in milk in cow's milk causes cancer tumors to grow causes cancer tumors to grow causes cancer tumors to grow this research was actually published by this research was actually published by this research was actually published by two hyderabad doctors two hyderabad doctors two hyderabad doctors in 1967 dr colin campbell dr colin campbell of cornell university when he saw that he was so surprised when he saw that he was so surprised that he thought that he thought that he thought the publisher had swapped the data the publisher had swapped the data the publisher had swapped the data and he wrote to the publisher and the and he wrote to the publisher and the and he wrote to the publisher and the publisher said no my data is correct publisher said no my data is correct publisher said no my data is correct this is what this is what this is what these two scientists gopalan and madhwan these two scientists gopalan and madhwan these two scientists gopalan and madhwan uh uh uh was saying was saying was saying so so so protein in milk is very unhealthy protein in milk is very unhealthy protein in milk is very unhealthy and and and it causes tumor cells foreign cells in our body tumor cells foreign cells in our body which are cancer cells which are cancer cells which are cancer cells which by the way are present in 99 of which by the way are present in 99 of which by the way are present in 99 of the population you can't escape them the population you can't escape them the population you can't escape them and causes them to grow so and causes them to grow so and causes them to grow so so what we are looking here is that so what we are looking here is that so what we are looking here is that almost one third to two thirds of our almost one third to two thirds of our almost one third to two thirds of our calories come coming from food which is calories come coming from food which is calories come coming from food which is unhealthy unhealthy unhealthy which is which is which is practically empty calories practically empty calories practically empty calories and that is the cause of most chronic and that is the cause of most chronic and that is the cause of most chronic problems problems problems if only we could replace that if only we could replace that if only we could replace that one-third to two-third calories from one-third to two-third calories from one-third to two-third calories from some healthy food some healthy food some healthy food your chronic illnesses will go away your chronic illnesses will go away your chronic illnesses will go away we experienced that i have over 23 000 members 23 000 members and they all report improved health and getting all report improved health and getting off all medications for diabetes off all medications for diabetes off all medications for diabetes hypertension cholesterol arthritis copd asthma and and many other diseases copd asthma and and many other diseases autoimmune diseases etc autoimmune diseases etc autoimmune diseases etc let's move to the next slide so what you see here and i recommend so what you see here and i recommend people that you consume so much food people that you consume so much food people that you consume so much food that you see here on this in this that you see here on this in this that you see here on this in this photograph photograph photograph there are a lot of green leafy there are a lot of green leafy there are a lot of green leafy vegetables vegetables vegetables there is a kale chard celery there is a

ginger lemon ginger lemon ginger beetroot beetroot beetroot green apples carrots green apples carrots green apples carrots and licorice and licorice and licorice now now now this is if you can replace those two this is if you can replace those two this is if you can replace those two third or half the calories which were third or half the calories which were third or half the calories which were coming coming coming from oil sugar and dairy sugar and dairy or ghee and oil or ghee and oil or ghee and oil with this food with this food with this food you will never have any health problem you will never have any health problem you will never have any health problem you will not have any problem any you will not have any problem any you will not have any problem any chronic chronic chronic problem and and i guarantee that and so problem and and i guarantee that and so problem and and i guarantee that and so that is what we that is what we that is what we suggest people do some find it difficult suggest people do some find it difficult suggest people do some find it difficult to eat to eat to eat these things raw these things raw these things raw and juicing is that's why i'm saying and juicing is that's why i'm saying and juicing is that's why i'm saying juicing is one way it is the second best juicing is one way it is the second best juicing is one way it is the second best option to eating them raw option to eating them raw option to eating them raw as salad as salad as salad and if you take that juice a glass of and if you take that juice a glass of and if you take that juice a glass of juice before every meal juice before every meal juice before every meal 15 minutes before breakfast 15 minutes 15 minutes before breakfast 15 minutes 15 minutes before breakfast 15 minutes before lunch and 15 minutes before before lunch and 15 minutes before before lunch and 15 minutes before dinner dinner dinner you will not have any health problems you will not have any health problems you will not have any health problems and all health problems that you have and all health problems that you have and all health problems that you have will go away will go away will go away chronic problems not problems you were chronic problems not problems you were chronic problems not problems you were born with not congenital problems but born with not congenital problems but born with not congenital problems but chronic problems okay so let's move to chronic problems okay so let's move to chronic problems okay so let's move to the next chart i wanted to share with you that in 2016 i wanted to share with you that in 2016 dr yoshinori received nobel prize for dr yoshinori received nobel prize for dr yoshinori received nobel prize for his research his research his research now we had known at that time now we had known at that time now we had known at that time based on research on based on research on based on research on mice mice mice that those mice which are deprived of that those mice which are deprived of that those mice which are deprived of food for one day a week food for one day a week food for one day a week almost live 50 percent longer their almost live 50 percent longer their almost live 50 percent longer their lifespan increases by 50 lifespan increases by 50 lifespan increases by 50 but how it works was not well known but how it works was not well known but how it works was not well known and dr yoshinori and dr yoshinori and dr yoshinori his research his research his research demonstrated how it works he explained demonstrated how it works he explained demonstrated how it works he explained that there is a process called autophagy that there is a process called autophagy that there is a process called autophagy when body runs out of protein when body runs out of protein when body runs out of protein it looks for that protein it looks for that protein it looks for that protein in other parts of the body in other parts of the body in other parts of the body where waste where waste where waste was being collected was being collected was being collected and and and so every cell has a so every cell has a so every cell has a like like a trash can and it's called lysosome and it's called lysosome so when a cell has a so when a cell has a so when a cell has a waste protein a spent protein it keeps waste protein a spent protein it keeps waste protein a spent protein it keeps it in that it in that it in that trash can trash can trash can when we fast and we run out of protein and we run out of protein because no new food is coming because no new food is coming because no new food is coming the body begins to recycle the waste the body begins to recycle the waste the body begins to recycle the waste it has stored in the waste pin it has stored in the waste pin it has stored in the waste pin and this is this can be seen under and this is this can be seen under and this is this can be seen under microscope microscope microscope under powerful electron microscopes you under powerful electron microscopes you under powerful electron microscopes you can see this happening it's very amazing can see this happening it's very amazing can see this happening it's very amazing every cell in your body every cell in your body every cell in your body of those 30 trillion cells starts going of those 30 trillion cells starts going of those 30 trillion cells starts going through a process of autophagy through a process of autophagy through a process of autophagy it begins around it begins around it begins around 18 hours but it increases more as you 18 hours but it increases more as you 18 hours but it increases more as you reach 24 hours reach 24 hours reach 24 hours and and then it continues so autophagy so autophagy happens when the shortage of protein it helps every cell detoxify itself it helps every cell detoxify itself and and that trash can becomes empty and and that trash can becomes empty and and that trash can becomes empty it's kind of like it's kind of like it's kind of like you going through you going through you going through the day before diwali we have what we the day before diwali we have what we the day before diwali we have what we call narkachodas call narkachodas call narkachodas we go through our house we get rid of we go through our house we get rid of we go through our house we get rid of old clothes we don't wear anymore old clothes we don't wear anymore old clothes we don't wear anymore which were clogging our closets which were clogging our closets which were clogging our closets we donate them we donate them we donate them we we we take out take out take out old old old maybe glasses you know you buy a set of maybe glasses you know you buy a set of maybe glasses you know you buy a set of eight glasses and then they keep eight glasses and then they keep eight glasses and then they keep breaking and then you have only one left breaking and then you have only one left breaking and then you have only one left and doesn't match into anything and doesn't match into anything and doesn't match into anything you you go through your attics and do a you you go through your attics and do a you you go through your attics and do a deep cleaning of course deep cleaning of course deep cleaning of course in india we used to get a white wash in india we used to get a white wash in india we used to get a white wash done done done so the whole idea is you're cleaning so the whole idea is you're cleaning so the whole idea is you're cleaning your house of things which you do not your house of things which you do not your house of things which you do not need anymore need anymore need anymore which are which are which are if you don't clean them then your if you don't clean them then your if you don't clean them then your closets closets closets get overloaded get overloaded get overloaded you certainly find that you certainly find that you certainly find that you're using your garage you're using your garage you're using your garage to store clothes and you're buying those to store clothes and you're buying those to store clothes and you're buying those 99 white laminate closets 99 white laminate closets 99 white laminate closets from a scandinavian design and suddenly from a scandinavian design and suddenly from a scandinavian design and suddenly your garage becomes your your garage becomes your your garage becomes your secondary closet secondary closet secondary closet so a cleaning once in a while is very so a cleaning once in a while is very so a cleaning once in a while is very good good good and and and navratri fast provides you that navratri fast provides you that navratri fast provides you that opportunity opportunity opportunity to clean to clean to clean the dead cells the dead cells the dead cells the damaged cells the damaged cells the damaged cells and the trash can inside each cell and the trash can inside each cell and the trash can inside each cell the 2018 nobel prize also went to this the 2018 nobel prize also went to this the 2018 nobel prize also went to this subject subject subject and dr honzo demonstrated so the focus was so the focus was extended fast for him extended fast for him extended fast for him that when we keep extended fast that when we keep extended fast that when we keep extended fast the stress caused by deprivation of the stress caused by deprivation of the stress caused by deprivation of protein makes human cells protein makes human cells protein makes human cells resistant to cancer resistant to cancer resistant to cancer and cancer treatments like chemotherapy and cancer treatments like chemotherapy and cancer treatments like chemotherapy and radiation and radiation and radiation are are are more successful more successful more successful because they are no longer killing because they are no longer killing because they are no longer killing our healthy cells they're only killing our healthy cells they're only killing our healthy cells they're only killing the cancer cells the cancer cells the cancer cells and it also provides immunity so if you and it also provides immunity so if you and it also provides immunity so if you would do navratri fast every year even if it is only once a year even if it is only once a year you are likely to not you are likely to not you are likely to not suffer from cancer suffer from cancer suffer from cancer that's the whole idea here the lot of that's the whole idea here the lot of that's the whole idea here the lot of chronic illnesses which have started chronic illnesses which have started chronic illnesses which have started progressing progressing progressing can be reversed can be reversed can be reversed if you would keep that fast if you would keep that fast if you would keep that fast once a year that is what dr hanzo once a year that is what dr hanzo once a year that is what dr hanzo recommends that one should do recommends that one should do recommends that one should do he recommends 10 days the same thing and he recommends 10 days the same thing and he recommends 10 days the same thing and one should do a 10-day fast one should do a 10-day fast one should do a 10-day fast once or twice a year so so both of these both of these both of these uh uh uh pieces of information from 2016 nobel pieces of information from 2016 nobel pieces of information from 2016 nobel prize 2018 nobel prize prize 2018 nobel prize prize 2018 nobel prize somehow our ancestors knew or they were somehow our ancestors knew or they were somehow our ancestors knew or they were aware of it that is why aware of it that is why aware of it that is why they prescribe they prescribe they prescribe the three things which are very the three things which are very the three things which are very important one important one important one a daily fasting for 12 to 16 hours a daily fasting for 12 to 16 hours a daily fasting for 12 to 16 hours a a kadashi fasting every two weeks a a kadashi fasting every two weeks a a kadashi fasting every two weeks of 36 hours of 36 hours of 36 hours and once a year navratri fast and once a year navratri fast and once a year navratri fast for nine days for nine days for nine days now it is difficult to keep nine day now it is difficult to keep nine day now it is difficult to keep nine day fast without consuming anything fast without consuming anything fast without consuming anything so so so what what what is recommended what the science is recommended what the science is recommended what the science recommends what dr honzo recommends recommends what dr honzo recommends recommends what dr honzo recommends is that you consume a is that you consume a is that you consume a light meal light meal light meal only one meal only one meal only one meal of 500 calories or less and choose your meal so that it is and choose your meal so that it is very low in protein the whole idea is to very low in protein the whole idea is to very low in protein the whole idea is to leave your body in a stressed stage leave your body in a stressed stage leave your body in a stressed stage for nine days for nine days for nine days and the body goes into a stress stage and the body goes into a stress stage and the body goes into a stress stage when it does not receive any protein when it does not receive any protein when it does not receive any protein that is what we are talking about we're that is what we are talking about we're that is what we are talking about we're talking about depriving body talking about depriving body talking about depriving body of of of protein protein protein in diet in diet in diet for a stretch of nine days for a stretch of nine days for a stretch of nine days by allowing you to consume some 500 by allowing you to consume some 500 by allowing you to consume some 500 calories calories calories it makes the process easy it makes the process easy it makes the process easy of course if you do the fast without of course if you do the fast without of course if you do the fast without consuming any food consuming any food consuming any food as jans do genes do a fast once a year as jans do genes do a fast once a year as jans do genes do a fast once a year where where where and in fact it ended just about three and in fact it ended just about three and in fact it ended just about three weeks ago weeks ago weeks ago where they don't take any food where they don't take any food where they don't take any food for eight for eight for eight days days days and that is the healthiest cost and that is the healthiest cost and that is the healthiest cost and navratri fast can also be done and navratri fast can also be done and navratri fast can also be done without without without consuming any food but it is uh but it is uh it is a little difficult for people who it is a little difficult for people who it is a little difficult for people who are do not have healthy are do not have healthy are do not have healthy uh eating habits because we develop uh eating habits because we develop uh eating habits because we develop addictions addictions addictions people don't realize but of course people don't realize but of course people don't realize but of course everybody is aware of the fact that everybody is aware of the fact that everybody is aware of the fact that alcohol is addictive and alcohol is addictive and alcohol is addictive and tobacco and smoking is addictive similarly your tea and coffee is similarly your tea and coffee is addictive as well so when you do not get addictive as well so when you do not get addictive as well so when you do not get tea tea tea at the time you normally take it you at the time you normally take it you at the time you normally take it you develop headache within two three hours develop headache within two three hours develop headache within two three hours and and you can't focus on your work so and and you can't focus on your work so and and you can't focus on your work so tea and coffee are addictive similarly tea and coffee are addictive similarly tea and coffee are addictive similarly there are other foods which are there are other foods which are there are other foods which are addictive addictive addictive fat is addictive fat is addictive fat is addictive cheese cheese cheese which is very high in fat which is very high in fat which is very high in fat chocolate chocolate chocolate is addictive is addictive is addictive french fries are addictive french fries are addictive french fries are addictive so so they have their food addiction as so so they have their food addiction as so so they have their food addiction as well so when well so when well so when if you're going to be keeping fast for if you're going to be keeping fast for if you're going to be keeping fast for the first time the first time the first time you're going to have difficulties you will if your normal eating time is nine will if your normal eating time is nine o'clock then by 10 30 11 you will start o'clock then by 10 30 11 you will start o'clock then by 10 30 11 you will start having headache having headache having headache and and other problems and and so if you so if you so if you want to keep the fast and that caffeine want to keep the fast and that caffeine want to keep the fast and that caffeine problem is not allowing you to go to problem is not allowing you to go to problem is not allowing you to go to toilet i say okay you can have some tea toilet i say okay you can have some tea toilet i say okay you can have some tea or coffee or coffee or coffee not that i recommend it but if the not that i recommend it but if the not that i recommend it but if the choices between breaking the fast choices between breaking the fast choices between breaking the fast or keeping the fast with some or keeping the fast with some or keeping the fast with some black tea without cream and sugar or black tea without cream and sugar or black tea without cream and sugar or black coffee black coffee black coffee it is fine it is halfway to your it is fine it is halfway to your it is fine it is halfway to your to your stomach to your stomach to your stomach taking black coffee empty stomach is one taking black coffee empty stomach is one taking black coffee empty stomach is one of the cause for ulcers of the cause for ulcers of the cause for ulcers but at this time if the choice is but at this time if the choice is but at this time if the choice is between completing nine day fast or between completing nine day fast or between completing nine day fast or having slight damage having slight damage having slight damage by having by having by having black tea black tea black tea i think a slight damage having black tea i think a slight damage having black tea i think a slight damage having black tea is preferred over is preferred over is preferred over not having the nine day fast not having the nine day fast not having the nine day fast okay so we'll move on next slide please okay okay so so so so so so what i'm talking here is what happens to what i'm talking here is what happens to what i'm talking here is what happens to your body your body your body when you deprive body of any food when you deprive body of any food when you deprive body of any food so so so there are eight different stages there are eight different stages there are eight different stages your body goes through your body has a ability to store your body has a ability to store some sugar some sugar some sugar in the form of glycogen in the form of glycogen in the form of glycogen about 100 grams of sugar is stored in about 100 grams of sugar is stored in about 100 grams of sugar is stored in liver liver liver 400 grams of sugar is stored in our 400 grams of sugar is stored in our 400 grams of sugar is stored in our muscles muscles muscles so so so the sugar which is stored in our liver the sugar which is stored in our liver the sugar which is stored in our liver runs out in within 12 hours runs out in within 12 hours runs out in within 12 hours so if you're finished your dinner so if you're finished your dinner so if you're finished your dinner previous night at seven o'clock by next morning seven o'clock the sugar by next morning seven o'clock the sugar in your liver runs out in your liver runs out in your liver runs out when your body runs out of when your body runs out of when your body runs out of glucose body gives a signal body gives a signal to the brain and body begins to and body begins to burn the fat burn the fat burn the fat the fat is stored that's the place for for storage of that's the place for for storage of energy energy energy and generally most of us have enough fat and generally most of us have enough fat and generally most of us have enough fat stored stored stored to last us four to six months to last us four to six months to last us four to six months the longest fasting done the record is the longest fasting done the record is the longest fasting done the record is 382 days 382 days 382 days so this fellow was able to fast so this fellow was able to fast so this fellow was able to fast on water only on water only on water only for 382 days for 382 days for 382 days okay he obviously lost about 150 pounds of he obviously lost about 150 pounds of weight weight weight which was a fat which was a fat which was a fat but the point i'm trying to emphasize is but the point i'm trying to emphasize is but the point i'm trying to emphasize is that that that when you fast when you fast when you fast your body after 12 hours starts to burn your body after 12 hours starts to burn your body after 12 hours starts to burn fat fat fat now when body burns fat the certain the certain ketone bodies are generated in place of ketone bodies are generated in place of ketone bodies are generated in place of glucose glucose glucose and your brain runs on ketone bodies and your brain runs on ketone bodies and your brain runs on ketone bodies instead of running on glucose that is a signaling mechanism to the that is a signaling mechanism to the brain brain brain that there's shortage of food that there's shortage of food that there's shortage of food and and and it starts several processes it starts several processes it starts several processes to adapt to the shortage of food and one to adapt to the shortage of food and one to adapt to the shortage of food and one of which is of which is of which is the recycling the recycling the recycling of of of waste protein waste protein waste protein using that protein so using that protein so using that protein so but the stage one is the body moves its but the stage one is the body moves its but the stage one is the body moves its metabolic mechanism from glucose burning metabolic mechanism from glucose burning metabolic mechanism from glucose burning to to to fat burning fat burning fat burning if you do intermittent fasting you will if you do intermittent fasting you will if you do intermittent fasting you will go through this process every day go through this process every day go through this process every day for three four hours if you are on a 16 for three four hours if you are on a 16 for three four hours if you are on a 16 hour hour hour fasting window fasting window fasting window and you go into ketosis at the 12th hour and you go into ketosis at the 12th hour and you go into ketosis at the 12th hour so you have four additional hours of so you have four additional hours of so you have four additional hours of burning fat burning fat burning fat that's why daily intermittent fasting that's why daily intermittent fasting that's why daily intermittent fasting helps lose weight helps lose weight helps lose weight because because because when you are burning when you are burning when you are burning ketone fat to produce ketone bodies ketone fat to produce ketone bodies ketone fat to produce ketone bodies the brain increases your metabolic rate the brain increases your metabolic rate the brain increases your metabolic rate to do the same activity for example to to do the same activity for example to to do the same activity for example to walk the same one mile if normally you walk the same one mile if normally you walk the same one mile if normally you spend 100 calories spend 100 calories spend 100 calories during intermittent fasting you will during intermittent fasting you will during intermittent fasting you will spend 110 calories spend 110 calories spend 110 calories so so so even if you keep eating whatever you even if you keep eating whatever you even if you keep eating whatever you have been eating but you reduce your have been eating but you reduce your have been eating but you reduce your eating window to only eight hours eating window to only eight hours eating window to only eight hours you will begin to lose weight second stage at 18 hours second stage at 18 hours when the ketone levels when the ketone levels when the ketone levels go go go up in your body up in your body up in your body it signals the body to it signals the body to it signals the body to stress busting pathways stress busting pathways stress busting pathways to reduce inflammation and repair dna to reduce inflammation and repair dna to reduce inflammation and repair dna damage so these are the damage so these are the damage so these are the detoxification processes detoxification processes detoxification processes rejuvenation processes i am talking rejuvenation processes i am talking rejuvenation processes i am talking about about about and your body begins and your body begins and your body begins to do those to do those to do those repair the dna repair the dna repair the dna and reduce the inflammation and reduce the inflammation and reduce the inflammation when we cross when we cross when we cross the 24 hour mark the 24 hour mark the 24 hour mark now autophagy is at its peak now autophagy is at its peak now autophagy is at its peak but this is autophagy but this is autophagy but this is autophagy from the trash can from the trash can from the trash can within each cell within each cell within each cell so it's looking for the food is looking so it's looking for the food is looking so it's looking for the food is looking for protein in that trash can for protein in that trash can for protein in that trash can it takes that protein converts it into it takes that protein converts it into it takes that protein converts it into amino acids amino acids amino acids and puts those amino acids into the and puts those amino acids into the and puts those amino acids into the blood which circulate to all the 30 blood which circulate to all the 30 blood which circulate to all the 30 trillion cells trillion cells trillion cells so that is the cleaning process that's so that is the cleaning process that's so that is the cleaning process that's going on called autophagy when you reach 36 hour mark when you reach 36 hour mark so now all the cells have been cleaned so now all the cells have been cleaned so now all the cells have been cleaned up up up and and your protein is still not coming and and your protein is still not coming and and your protein is still not coming so at that time the autophagy moves on so at that time the autophagy moves on so at that time the autophagy moves on to to to other cells which are in between the other cells which are in between the other cells which are in between the cells not it is not inside each cell it cells not it is not inside each cell it cells not it is not inside each cell it is is is damaged cells which are sitting in damaged cells which are sitting in damaged cells which are sitting in between healthy cells between healthy cells between healthy cells you know a lot of your wrinkles in your you know a lot of your wrinkles in your you know a lot of your wrinkles in your skin skin skin is because of those damaged cells is because of those damaged cells is because of those damaged cells it begins to there's a cell we call it begins to there's a cell we call it begins to there's a cell we call senescent cells senescent cells are senescent cells senescent cells are senescent cells senescent cells are those cells those cells those cells which are which are which are not killed not killed not killed but they have stopped reproducing but they have stopped reproducing but they have stopped reproducing so so they sit so they sit in between healthy cells and they in between healthy cells and they in between healthy cells and they secrete certain chemicals which make secrete certain chemicals which make secrete certain chemicals which make which when they come in contact with which when they come in contact with which when they come in contact with healthy cells they make them also damage healthy cells they make them also damage healthy cells they make them also damage cells cells cells if you all have if you all have if you all have bought strawberry baskets and sometimes bought strawberry baskets and sometimes bought strawberry baskets and sometimes put them in your freezer in your put them in your freezer in your put them in your freezer in your refrigerator refrigerator refrigerator and it's deep inside and you forget that and it's deep inside and you forget that and it's deep inside and you forget that there were a basket of strawberries you there were a basket of strawberries you there were a basket of strawberries you take it out after take it out after take it out after two three weeks you find that two three weeks you find that two three weeks you find that strawberries have developed fungus strawberries have developed fungus strawberries have developed fungus if you do one experiment and you buy a if you do one experiment and you buy a if you do one experiment and you buy a fresh fresh fresh basket of strawberries basket of strawberries basket of strawberries and remove and remove and remove from the top from the top from the top six seven strawberries and take one six seven strawberries and take one six seven strawberries and take one damage fungus strawberries put it there damage fungus strawberries put it there damage fungus strawberries put it there and then cover it with and then cover it with and then cover it with fresh strawberries again and then look at it after one day or two and then look at it after one day or two days you will find days you will find days you will find that the four or five strawberries which that the four or five strawberries which that the four or five strawberries which were in contact with the were in contact with the were in contact with the with the rotten strawberry with the rotten strawberry with the rotten strawberry get also get damaged get also get damaged get also get damaged the part of this fresh strawberry which the part of this fresh strawberry which the part of this fresh strawberry which was in contact with that rotten was in contact with that rotten was in contact with that rotten strawberry develops that fungus strawberry develops that fungus strawberry develops that fungus the same thing happens in our body the same thing happens in our body the same thing happens in our body the four or five cells which are the four or five cells which are the four or five cells which are surrounding a senescent cell surrounding a senescent cell surrounding a senescent cell also get damaged also get damaged also get damaged by the secretion of that senescent cell by the secretion of that senescent cell by the secretion of that senescent cell so at this stage your body begins to so at this stage your body begins to so at this stage your body begins to recycle recycle recycle those senescent cells those senescent cells those senescent cells it's it's it's a great process it's a it's it's it's a great process it's a it's it's it's a great process it's a rejuvenating process rejuvenating process rejuvenating process people who keep these fast people who keep these fast people who keep these fast every two weeks or every two weeks or every two weeks or navrati fast every one year or twice a navrati fast every one year or twice a navrati fast every one year or twice a year you'll find that your skin becomes year you'll find that your skin becomes year you'll find that your skin becomes smoother smoother smoother your wrinkles decline of course there's your wrinkles decline of course there's your wrinkles decline of course there's only so much you can achieve only so much you can achieve only so much you can achieve but just imagine if you did that but just imagine if you did that but just imagine if you did that throughout your life throughout your life throughout your life you will have you will have you will have a shiny a shiny a shiny smooth skin smooth skin smooth skin even when you are 75 years old even when you are 75 years old even when you are 75 years old okay okay okay so that's the process that's going on at so that's the process that's going on at so that's the process that's going on at 36 hours 36 hours 36 hours at 48 hours at 48 hours at 48 hours the growth hormones in our body which get released while we are fasting which get released while we are fasting they reach their highest level they reach their highest level they reach their highest level they're almost at five times the level they're almost at five times the level they're almost at five times the level before you started fasting before you started fasting before you started fasting so so so within 48 hours within 48 hours within 48 hours your growth hormones are the highest your growth hormones are the highest your growth hormones are the highest level level level and and and when you are removing all these damaged when you are removing all these damaged when you are removing all these damaged cells cells cells you also need to create new cells so for you also need to create new cells so for you also need to create new cells so for those new cell creation those new cell creation those new cell creation you need growth hormones and that is you need growth hormones and that is you need growth hormones and that is what the body is doing is preparing what the body is doing is preparing what the body is doing is preparing itself itself itself to when you start eating food again to to when you start eating food again to to when you start eating food again to make new cells at 54 hours at 54 hours our insulin level drops to the lowest our insulin level drops to the lowest our insulin level drops to the lowest point so when the insulin is at the low point so when the insulin is at the low point the body becomes more insulin sensitive the body becomes more insulin sensitive the body becomes more insulin sensitive which helps which helps which helps people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic people who are diabetic or pre-diabetic diabetes is a disease of diabetes is a disease of diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance insulin resistance insulin resistance as we live our as we live our as we live our our life from the age to when we start our life from the age to when we start our life from the age to when we start eating eating eating with our parents on on a dining table and we are fed the on on a dining table and we are fed the food that parents have been eating food that parents have been eating food that parents have been eating the milk a cow's milk comes into our the milk a cow's milk comes into our the milk a cow's milk comes into our diet the eggs come into our diet the oil diet the eggs come into our diet the oil diet the eggs come into our diet the oil and sugar comes in our diet and sugar comes in our diet and sugar comes in our diet we start developing a resistance to we start developing a resistance to we start developing a resistance to insulin so maybe we develop one percent so maybe we develop one percent resistance two percent resistance it resistance two percent resistance it resistance two percent resistance it doesn't bother us doesn't bother us doesn't bother us we have enough capacity in our pancreas we have enough capacity in our pancreas we have enough capacity in our pancreas to release insulin to release insulin to release insulin and they just release more insulin and and they just release more insulin and and they just release more insulin and make up for it make up for it make up for it so our body knows how to so our body knows how to so our body knows how to compensate compensate compensate but by the age of 40 but by the age of 40 but by the age of 40 45 when you realize that okay 45 when you realize that okay 45 when you realize that okay about one third of my insulin insulin receptors in my receptors in my receptors in my muscle cells have now muscle cells have now muscle cells have now been clogged been clogged been clogged with fat with fat with fat and and and pancreas cannot release any more insulin pancreas cannot release any more insulin pancreas cannot release any more insulin your sugar level begins to rise okay your sugar level begins to rise okay your sugar level begins to rise okay so your body is always compensating so your body is always compensating so your body is always compensating initially it compensates initially it compensates initially it compensates by by by increasing more insulin increasing more insulin increasing more insulin your blood sugar remains normal and then your blood sugar remains normal and then your blood sugar remains normal and then somewhere at age 40 45 somewhere at age 40 45 somewhere at age 40 45 50 50 50 body cannot produce any more insulin and body cannot produce any more insulin and body cannot produce any more insulin and sugar begins to rise sugar begins to rise sugar begins to rise and then and then and then arbitrarily at one point they say arbitrarily at one point they say arbitrarily at one point they say now now now your sugar level is high enough that your sugar level is high enough that your sugar level is high enough that we'll call you pre-diabetic we'll call you pre-diabetic we'll call you pre-diabetic that that cut-off point is arbitrary that that cut-off point is arbitrary that that cut-off point is arbitrary because disease always happens in a because disease always happens in a because disease always happens in a continuum it's happening every day from continuum it's happening every day from continuum it's happening every day from age two onwards age two onwards age two onwards your your your body has started becoming slowly body has started becoming slowly body has started becoming slowly resistant to insulin resistant to insulin resistant to insulin okay okay okay and then they decide that okay if you if and then they decide that okay if you if and then they decide that okay if you if your morning blood sugar reaches your morning blood sugar reaches your morning blood sugar reaches 126 or higher you are now a diabetic 126 or higher you are now a diabetic 126 or higher you are now a diabetic patient patient patient those cutoff points are arbitrary we'll those cutoff points are arbitrary we'll those cutoff points are arbitrary we'll discuss it more a little later okay so discuss it more a little later okay so discuss it more a little later okay so so this is how your body so this is how your body so this is how your body reverses reverses reverses your your diabetes your your diabetes your your diabetes uh uh uh problem problem problem and and that is what is going on at 54 and and that is what is going on at 54 and and that is what is going on at 54 hours hours hours you have reached the lowest point it is you have reached the lowest point it is you have reached the lowest point it is at the peak at the peak at the peak that that that that that that benefit is at the peak at that time it's benefit is at the peak at that time it's benefit is at the peak at that time it's not that it wasn't happening at 48 hours not that it wasn't happening at 48 hours not that it wasn't happening at 48 hours it was happening but it reaches the peak it was happening but it reaches the peak it was happening but it reaches the peak point point point by by by reducing the insulin level to the lowest reducing the insulin level to the lowest reducing the insulin level to the lowest point point point at 72 hours at 72 hours at 72 hours your breakdown of old immune cells so your breakdown of old immune cells so your breakdown of old immune cells so our body has immune cells our body has immune cells our body has immune cells which help which help which help our immunity immunity to infectious our immunity immunity to infectious our immunity immunity to infectious diseases immunity to diseases immunity to diseases immunity to cancer cancer cancer and many other diseases and many other diseases and many other diseases so at that time so at that time so at that time once the three days are over once the three days are over once the three days are over body begins to generate body begins to generate body begins to generate new immune cells which are more powerful new immune cells which are more powerful new immune cells which are more powerful and stronger and stronger and stronger and that is how we build immunity and that is how we build immunity and that is how we build immunity so clearly navratri fast navratri fast or any other fast that you may keep for or any other fast that you may keep for or any other fast that you may keep for three days four days three days four days three days four days will help you build immunity will help you build immunity will help you build immunity to even to even to even covet 19 covet 19 covet 19 and it has been well established the and it has been well established the and it has been well established the people who people who people who eat healthy diet eat healthy diet eat healthy diet live a healthy lifestyle live a healthy lifestyle live a healthy lifestyle follow intermittent fasting and follow intermittent fasting and follow intermittent fasting and regular fasting regular fasting regular fasting every two weeks every two weeks every two weeks have a stronger immunity to covet have a stronger immunity to covet have a stronger immunity to covet than public at large than public at large than public at large the eighth stage is the refeeding state the eighth stage is the refeeding state the eighth stage is the refeeding state this is when you break your fast of course for navratri fast we'll be of course for navratri fast we'll be breaking it every day breaking it every day breaking it every day um but when you keep a longer fast or um but when you keep a longer fast or um but when you keep a longer fast or that jain fast that we were talking that jain fast that we were talking that jain fast that we were talking about the refeeding is a very critical about the refeeding is a very critical about the refeeding is a very critical stage and you should not stage and you should not stage and you should not consume a lot of food consume a lot of food consume a lot of food in fact the rule of thumb is in fact the rule of thumb is in fact the rule of thumb is if you're keeping fast for x number of days x number of days your refeeding process should involve your refeeding process should involve your refeeding process should involve half of the eggs half of the eggs half of the eggs so if you're keeping fast for four days so if you're keeping fast for four days so if you're keeping fast for four days your refeeding program should be a your refeeding program should be a your refeeding program should be a two-day program two-day program two-day program and in that gen fast of and in that gen fast of and in that gen fast of eight days eight days eight days there there there they should be breaking that fast over a they should be breaking that fast over a they should be breaking that fast over a four day process four day process four day process before they go back to their normal before they go back to their normal before they go back to their normal daily meal okay so this was the most daily meal okay so this was the most daily meal okay so this was the most important slide that i wanted to get important slide that i wanted to get important slide that i wanted to get across across across in today's talk because a lot of people don't know because a lot of people don't know why they are keeping they know it body why they are keeping they know it body why they are keeping they know it body detoxifies detoxifies detoxifies but if you're going to consume but if you're going to consume but if you're going to consume an apple at 10 o'clock in the morning an apple at 10 o'clock in the morning an apple at 10 o'clock in the morning or a cup of tea with sugar or a cup of tea with sugar or a cup of tea with sugar your ketosis will not start because you your ketosis will not start because you your ketosis will not start because you have not had have not had have not had 12 hours 12 hours 12 hours without food without food without food if ketosis does not start if ketosis does not start if ketosis does not start or is broken or is broken or is broken then rest of the seven stages will not then rest of the seven stages will not then rest of the seven stages will not be achieved be achieved be achieved because that is the most important stage because that is the most important stage because that is the most important stage and the body needs to be in a stress and the body needs to be in a stress and the body needs to be in a stress mode mode mode and that is why when and that is why when and that is why when we keep navratri fast we keep navratri fast we keep navratri fast your meal should be a light meal your meal should be a light meal your meal should be a light meal i mean you can eat 2 000 calories i mean you can eat 2 000 calories i mean you can eat 2 000 calories at six o'clock in the evening there are at six o'clock in the evening there are at six o'clock in the evening there are a lot of people a lot of spiritual a lot of people a lot of spiritual a lot of people a lot of spiritual people people people eat one meal a day every day all their eat one meal a day every day all their eat one meal a day every day all their life life life but they don't lose weight necessarily but they don't lose weight necessarily but they don't lose weight necessarily because they eat a sufficient meal if because they eat a sufficient meal if because they eat a sufficient meal if they need 2 000 calories they consume 2 they need 2 000 calories they consume 2 they need 2 000 calories they consume 2 000 calories over a one hour window 000 calories over a one hour window 000 calories over a one hour window eating windows so eating windows so eating windows so in navratri fast you should try to in navratri fast you should try to in navratri fast you should try to consume all your meal within a one hour consume all your meal within a one hour consume all your meal within a one hour eating window eating window eating window the meal should only be 500 calories so the meal should only be 500 calories so the meal should only be 500 calories so that the body that the body that the body does remain does remain does remain or achieves ketosis again so 500 or achieves ketosis again so 500 or achieves ketosis again so 500 calories will get burned out calories will get burned out calories will get burned out very quickly very quickly very quickly the calories are used to the calories are used to the calories are used to to to replenish your muscles with to to replenish your muscles with to to replenish your muscles with glucose glucose glucose and then only extra calories left after and then only extra calories left after and then only extra calories left after replenishing muscles are stored in your replenishing muscles are stored in your replenishing muscles are stored in your liver as glycogen liver as glycogen liver as glycogen so during navratri fast those 500 so during navratri fast those 500 so during navratri fast those 500 calories will be quickly replenishing calories will be quickly replenishing calories will be quickly replenishing your glucose your glucose your glucose in your muscles in your muscles in your muscles and your liver is not likely to get the the the the 100 grams 100 grams 100 grams which is 400 calories so so you would which is 400 calories so so you would which is 400 calories so so you would remain remain remain in ketosis mode in ketosis mode in ketosis mode most of the time most of the time most of the time during this eight day fast let's move to during this eight day fast let's move to during this eight day fast let's move to the next slide i hope this point is the next slide i hope this point is the next slide i hope this point is clear okay next slide so here i have described a a a so here i have described a a a suggested meal plan for for three meals three meals three meals you need to have some green vegetables you need to have some green vegetables you need to have some green vegetables they are very good for you they are the they are very good for you they are the they are very good for you they are the ones which will ones which will ones which will help help help reduce your blood pressure reduce your blood pressure reduce your blood pressure because green leafy vegetables have because green leafy vegetables have because green leafy vegetables have nitrates nitrates nitrates and they release nitric oxide which act and they release nitric oxide which act and they release nitric oxide which act as a as a as a as a drain or as a drain or as a drain or that you use to clean your kitchen sink that you use to clean your kitchen sink that you use to clean your kitchen sink when you kitchen sink less clog when you kitchen sink less clog when you kitchen sink less clog you you you first try to use some first try to use some first try to use some chemical compound some liquid to clean chemical compound some liquid to clean chemical compound some liquid to clean it it it so green leafy vegetables provide nitric so green leafy vegetables provide nitric so green leafy vegetables provide nitric oxide which oxide which oxide which works like a draenor works like a draenor works like a draenor or a or a or a roto-rooter so if you have a half a roto-rooter so if you have a half a roto-rooter so if you have a half a pound pound pound which would be about 260 that will provide you about 50 calories that will provide you about 50 calories then some low protein fruits then some low protein fruits then some low protein fruits now now now some fruits are very low in protein like some fruits are very low in protein like some fruits are very low in protein like apple or pears apple or pears apple or pears some fruits are very high in protein some fruits are very high in protein some fruits are very high in protein like guavas obviously you don't want to like guavas obviously you don't want to like guavas obviously you don't want to eat guavas eat guavas eat guavas while fasting you want to eat while fasting you want to eat while fasting you want to eat apples or pears or grapefruit apples or pears or grapefruit apples or pears or grapefruit fruits which are low in protein that is fruits which are low in protein that is fruits which are low in protein that is what you want to eat starchy vegetables what you want to eat starchy vegetables what you want to eat starchy vegetables like potatoes rb sweet potatoes sweet potatoes you want to consume them you want to consume them you want to consume them they are fairly low in in protein this they are fairly low in in protein this they are fairly low in in protein this protein is about five protein is about five protein is about five five and a half percent in pro in five and a half percent in pro in five and a half percent in pro in potatoes potatoes potatoes and and you can mix them in your meal and and you can mix them in your meal and and you can mix them in your meal so that's what i recommend so

tarot root english it's known as uh tarot root tarot root should be tarot root should be tarot root should be should be taken then then tapioca surprisingly tapioca surprisingly tapioca surprisingly tapioca or sabudana tapioca or sabudana tapioca or sabudana is totally devoid of protein there is no is totally devoid of protein there is no is totally devoid of protein there is no protein protein protein at all by by that i mean is less than at all by by that i mean is less than at all by by that i mean is less than uh uh uh point point point one percent one percent one percent okay okay okay so sabudana is an ideal meal so sabudana is an ideal meal so sabudana is an ideal meal for foss for foss for foss it just amazes how did our ancestors it just amazes how did our ancestors it just amazes how did our ancestors know that i have absolutely no clue know that i have absolutely no clue know that i have absolutely no clue obviously they were smart enough and obviously they were smart enough and obviously they were smart enough and they figured out they figured out they figured out and it perplexes me how they figured out and it perplexes me how they figured out and it perplexes me how they figured out that sabudana is the only thing that sabudana is the only thing that sabudana is the only thing which is devoid of protein it's very which is devoid of protein it's very which is devoid of protein it's very hard to find food hard to find food hard to find food in the plant kingdom in the plant kingdom in the plant kingdom which is devoid of protein which is devoid of protein which is devoid of protein so try to consume your meal made of so try to consume your meal made of so try to consume your meal made of sabudana sabudana sabudana you can sabudana you can sabudana you

meal plan and definitely during navratri meal plan never have to be fast never have to be fast never have to be fast let's move to the next slide okay so i wanted to briefly discuss okay so i wanted to briefly discuss chronic diseases chronic diseases chronic diseases and show you how these fast can achieve and show you how these fast can achieve and show you how these fast can achieve that that that let's skip to the next slide here i have listed 10 leading causes of here i have listed 10 leading causes of death in u.s it pretty much applies the death in u.s it pretty much applies the death in u.s it pretty much applies the same same same worldwide worldwide cancer and cancer and lung problems may be higher than heart lung problems may be higher than heart lung problems may be higher than heart disease disease disease because still a lot of people are because still a lot of people are because still a lot of people are smoking smoking smoking around the world in u.s smoking has been around the world in u.s smoking has been around the world in u.s smoking has been cut down so cut down so cut down so lung diseases have become number three lung diseases have become number three lung diseases have become number three but but but heart diseases cancer heart diseases cancer heart diseases cancer lung diseases lung diseases lung diseases strokes and cerebral strokes and cerebral strokes and cerebral vascular diseases alzheimer's vascular diseases alzheimer's vascular diseases alzheimer's diabetes diabetes diabetes influenza and pneumonia influenza and pneumonia influenza and pneumonia kidney diseases liver diseases and kidney diseases liver diseases and kidney diseases liver diseases and hypertension these are the hypertension these are the hypertension these are the leading chronic diseases these are the leading chronic diseases these are the leading chronic diseases these are the causes of causes of causes of death death death throughout the world throughout the world throughout the world and i'll show you how we and i'll show you how we and i'll show you how we can cure these diseases by can cure these diseases by can cure these diseases by of course healthy plant-based whole food of course healthy plant-based whole food of course healthy plant-based whole food diet but also by fasting regularly let's diet but also by fasting regularly let's diet but also by fasting regularly let's move to the next slide okay so what i'm trying to show here is okay so what i'm trying to show here is that the disease chronic diseases that the disease chronic diseases that the disease chronic diseases lie on a continuum lie on a continuum lie on a continuum i discussed that briefly earlier for i discussed that briefly earlier for i discussed that briefly earlier for diabetes diabetes diabetes so if you look at the middle of this s so if you look at the middle of this s so if you look at the middle of this s curve curve curve it is almost a straight line the middle it is almost a straight line the middle it is almost a straight line the middle portion portion portion so body moves on that straight line up so body moves on that straight line up so body moves on that straight line up and down one day you eat healthy it and down one day you eat healthy it and down one day you eat healthy it comes down comes down comes down one day you eat some unhealthy food and one day you eat some unhealthy food and one day you eat some unhealthy food and you had the hiki lassi it becomes a you had the hiki lassi it becomes a you had the hiki lassi it becomes a little bit unhealthy little bit unhealthy little bit unhealthy but it keeps moving up and down you do but it keeps moving up and down you do but it keeps moving up and down you do you you do it fast you you do it fast you you do it fast uh every two weeks so if you were uh every two weeks so if you were uh every two weeks so if you were eating some unhealthy things during the eating some unhealthy things during the eating some unhealthy things during the 13-14 days by keeping that fast you pull 13-14 days by keeping that fast you pull 13-14 days by keeping that fast you pull the body back into the healthy range the body back into the healthy range the body back into the healthy range and that is why and that is why and that is why [Music] [Music] [Music] daily fasting of 16 hours is very daily fasting of 16 hours is very daily fasting of 16 hours is very important it important it important it it it kind of makes up for some it it kind of makes up for some it it kind of makes up for some unhealthy eating a little bit of a unhealthy eating a little bit of a unhealthy eating a little bit of a one or two teaspoon of sugar one or two teaspoon of sugar one or two teaspoon of sugar and one or two teaspoon of oil or ghee and one or two teaspoon of oil or ghee and one or two teaspoon of oil or ghee um it can be made up by that 16 hours of um it can be made up by that 16 hours of um it can be made up by that 16 hours of uh daily fasting uh daily fasting uh daily fasting um um um and then every two weeks when you do and then every two weeks when you do and then every two weeks when you do akatshi fasting it can again pull you akatshi fasting it can again pull you akatshi fasting it can again pull you back if you are reaching on the curved back if you are reaching on the curved back if you are reaching on the curved portion of of the curve on the top where portion of of the curve on the top where portion of of the curve on the top where i have written disease i have written disease i have written disease uh you can come back to the middle uh you can come back to the middle uh you can come back to the middle portion portion portion so that's what the fasting does it's so that's what the fasting does it's so that's what the fasting does it's amazing amazing amazing how it how it how it it creates a balance it it creates a balance it it creates a balance it it allows it allows it allows to compensate for some of your mischiefs and misbehavior and and eating mischiefs and misbehavior and and eating unhealthy food here and there unhealthy food here and there unhealthy food here and there now once you reach if you don't do those now once you reach if you don't do those now once you reach if you don't do those fast fast fast and you don't do and you don't do and you don't do any offsetting mechanism any offsetting mechanism any offsetting mechanism in a regular in a regular in a regular diet and lifestyle diet and lifestyle diet and lifestyle you reach the top when you you reach the top when you you reach the top when you your body begins to show symptoms your body begins to show symptoms your body begins to show symptoms symptoms symptoms symptoms only begin to show when body cannot make only begin to show when body cannot make only begin to show when body cannot make up and compensate anymore up and compensate anymore up and compensate anymore and that's when we say that okay i have and that's when we say that okay i have and that's when we say that okay i have got hypertension got hypertension got hypertension our blood pressure increases throughout our blood pressure increases throughout our blood pressure increases throughout life a little bit at a time life a little bit at a time life a little bit at a time and then it reaches and then it reaches and then it reaches 130 135 140 and we say okay you are now 130 135 140 and we say okay you are now 130 135 140 and we say okay you are now hypertension hypertension hypertension those markers are arbitrary they are those markers are arbitrary they are those markers are arbitrary they are decided by decided by decided by by doctors or by doctors or by doctors or leading institutions leading institutions leading institutions certain committees which decide certain committees which decide certain committees which decide that we'll call that we'll call that we'll call a blood pressure of 140 hypertension and a blood pressure of 140 hypertension and a blood pressure of 140 hypertension and under 130 as healthy and they're all under 130 as healthy and they're all under 130 as healthy and they're all arbitrary okay as we'll see further so arbitrary okay as we'll see further so arbitrary okay as we'll see further so this is how chronic diseases this is how chronic diseases this is how chronic diseases operate let's move next slide it is also it is also called hockey curve and hockey is called hockey curve and hockey is called hockey curve and hockey is probably a better probably a better probably a better uh explanation than jay uh explanation than jay uh explanation than jay what we are talking here is that we all what we are talking here is that we all what we are talking here is that we all know know know that that that if we all medicines if we all medicines if we all medicines have side effects have side effects have side effects so if we take too much medica medication so if we take too much medica medication so if we take too much medica medication we are hurting our bodies we are hurting our bodies we are hurting our bodies and we don't really know how we are and we don't really know how we are and we don't really know how we are hurting our bodies but we do know hurting our bodies but we do know hurting our bodies but we do know that medicines have negative side that medicines have negative side that medicines have negative side effects effects effects some of these get some of these get some of these get uh uh uh get declared on on the on the on the get declared on on the on the on the get declared on on the on the on the piece of paper that comes with your piece of paper that comes with your piece of paper that comes with your medicine medicine medicine because the doctors or the researchers because the doctors or the researchers because the doctors or the researchers or the pharmaceutical company or the pharmaceutical company or the pharmaceutical company was forced to declare three or four side was forced to declare three or four side was forced to declare three or four side effects effects effects but for every three or four side effects but for every three or four side effects but for every three or four side effects that they were forced to declare that they were forced to declare that they were forced to declare you can be just assured that there were you can be just assured that there were you can be just assured that there were others others others 16 17 that they could get away with 16 17 that they could get away with 16 17 that they could get away with they did not happen on everybody i they did not happen on everybody i they did not happen on everybody i happened on only very few cases happened on only very few cases happened on only very few cases and these side effects happen and these side effects happen and these side effects happen differently on different people because differently on different people because differently on different people because we all are different we all are different we all are different we may be we may be we may be similar genetically similar genetically similar genetically but we are very different epigenetically but we are very different epigenetically but we are very different epigenetically we live in different households we we we live in different households we we we live in different households we we eat different foods eat different foods eat different foods we eat the food that our our parents ate we eat the food that our our parents ate we eat the food that our our parents ate so a lot of things we attribute to jeans so a lot of things we attribute to jeans so a lot of things we attribute to jeans really really really has nothing to do with genes all it has has nothing to do with genes all it has has nothing to do with genes all it has to do with is how you were raised to do with is how you were raised to do with is how you were raised and if your mom and dad ate certain food and if your mom and dad ate certain food and if your mom and dad ate certain food you ate certain food you ate certain food you ate certain food and you developed certain similar and you developed certain similar and you developed certain similar diseases diseases diseases so they were not caused by genes we have so they were not caused by genes we have so they were not caused by genes we have a tendency to blame too many things on a tendency to blame too many things on a tendency to blame too many things on our genes our genes our genes but it really but it really but it really doesn't work that way genes may load the doesn't work that way genes may load the doesn't work that way genes may load the gun but you always have the trigger gun but you always have the trigger gun but you always have the trigger and when you pull the trigger the and when you pull the trigger the and when you pull the trigger the disease happens disease happens disease happens so we know so we know so we know that that that disease is harmful disease is harmful disease is harmful the higher blood pressure is harmful the higher blood pressure is harmful the higher blood pressure is harmful higher blood sugar is harmful higher blood sugar is harmful higher blood sugar is harmful it is hurting our body it is hurting our body it is hurting our body in ways in ways in ways we may not fully understand we may not fully understand we may not fully understand but we also know that but we also know that but we also know that taking high doses of taking high doses of taking high doses of medicine is harmful medicine is harmful medicine is harmful so there is a balance somewhere in so there is a balance somewhere in so there is a balance somewhere in between between between and that balance is where the bottom of and that balance is where the bottom of and that balance is where the bottom of the j is the j is the j is so so scientists and doctors have begun so so scientists and doctors have begun so so scientists and doctors have begun to believe now to believe now to believe now that controlling that controlling that controlling our symptoms too tightly is not very our symptoms too tightly is not very our symptoms too tightly is not very good for us good for us good for us if you control your blood pressure too if you control your blood pressure too if you control your blood pressure too tightly and keep it under 120 over 80 tightly and keep it under 120 over 80 tightly and keep it under 120 over 80 it is very unhealthy it is very unhealthy it is very unhealthy and they have a concept called all cause and they have a concept called all cause and they have a concept called all cause mortality mortality mortality death due to any cause death due to any cause death due to any cause or all causes combined so they say that or all causes combined so they say that or all causes combined so they say that if you control your if you control your if you control your symptoms too tightly symptoms too tightly symptoms too tightly you all cause mortality will go up you all cause mortality will go up you all cause mortality will go up and if you don't control your symptoms and if you don't control your symptoms and if you don't control your symptoms at all at all at all your all-cause mortality will also go up your all-cause mortality will also go up your all-cause mortality will also go up so if you were to draw a curve so if you were to draw a curve so if you were to draw a curve you will see a j happening you will see a j happening you will see a j happening and that is what we call j curve and that is what we call j curve and that is what we call j curve so lately in last so lately in last so lately in last decade or two decade or two decade or two many senior doctors have started many senior doctors have started many senior doctors have started expressing their opinion expressing their opinion expressing their opinion that we have gone too far that we have gone too far that we have gone too far taking medications for chronic diseases taking medications for chronic diseases taking medications for chronic diseases which were caused by diet and lifestyle which were caused by diet and lifestyle which were caused by diet and lifestyle issues issues issues is not appropriate is not appropriate is not appropriate and we really should try to address and we really should try to address and we really should try to address these these these diet and lifestyle diseases by changing diet and lifestyle diseases by changing diet and lifestyle diseases by changing diet and lifestyle diet and lifestyle diet and lifestyle something the doctors something the doctors something the doctors don't tell you and something the doctors don't tell you and something the doctors don't tell you and something the doctors are not taught are not taught are not taught they're only taught medicine they're only taught medicine they're only taught medicine they are not taught they are not taught they are not taught nutrition so they don't know and how can nutrition so they don't know and how can nutrition so they don't know and how can they tell you what they do not know they tell you what they do not know they tell you what they do not know and that is what we and that is what we and that is what we are talking here a a j curve phenomenon are talking here a a j curve phenomenon are talking here a a j curve phenomenon so so so diabetes diabetes diabetes guidelines were revised guidelines were revised guidelines were revised by american college of physicians which by american college of physicians which by american college of physicians which is a much larger body than american is a much larger body than american is a much larger body than american diabetes association diabetes association diabetes association or the association of clinical or the association of clinical or the association of clinical endocrinologists endocrinologists endocrinologists the specialist that you go and see for the specialist that you go and see for the specialist that you go and see for diabetes diabetes diabetes the american college of physicians moderated their guidelines to reduce use moderated their guidelines to reduce use of medication similarly for blood of medication similarly for blood of medication similarly for blood pressure pressure pressure the joint national committee which used the joint national committee which used the joint national committee which used to decide to decide to decide the cutoff point the cutoff point the cutoff point in 2014 revision they said in 2014 revision they said in 2014 revision they said we should not control blood pressure too we should not control blood pressure too we should not control blood pressure too tightly tightly tightly unfortunately your doctors are not aware unfortunately your doctors are not aware unfortunately your doctors are not aware of them or they pretend that they are of them or they pretend that they are of them or they pretend that they are not aware of them not aware of them not aware of them because nobody wants their clients to go because nobody wants their clients to go because nobody wants their clients to go away if you away if you away if you cure your hypertension and cure your cure your hypertension and cure your cure your hypertension and cure your diabetes diabetes diabetes then they have lost a patient and it then they have lost a patient and it then they have lost a patient and it reduces their income so let's look at reduces their income so let's look at reduces their income so let's look at the next slide so here are the guidelines so here are the guidelines that uh that show the j curve you can see the j that show the j curve you can see the j curve happening curve happening curve happening uh this is a study that was done in uh this is a study that was done in uh this is a study that was done in 2009 2009 2009 9 and 10 9 and 10 9 and 10 and was published in 2010 and was published in 2010 and was published in 2010 but but most doctors did not act on it it but most doctors did not act on it it shows that if you are taking oral shows that if you are taking oral shows that if you are taking oral medication for diabetes medication for diabetes medication for diabetes you you you reach reach reach the lowest all-cause mortality the lowest all-cause mortality the lowest all-cause mortality if your a1c is between 7.5 if your a1c is between 7.5 if your a1c is between 7.5 and 8.2 and 8.2 and 8.2 okay the lowest point is between 7.5 and okay the lowest point is between 7.5 and okay the lowest point is between 7.5 and 8.2 8.2 8.2 so based on that finally american so based on that finally american so based on that finally american college of physicians college of physicians college of physicians conceded in 2019 conceded in 2019 conceded in 2019 that we should try to maintain that we should try to maintain that we should try to maintain for diabetic patients who are on for diabetic patients who are on for diabetic patients who are on medication medication medication a1c a1c a1c under 8 or 8.2 under 8 or 8.2 under 8 or 8.2 and not under 7 and not under 7 and not under 7 as american diabetes association says as american diabetes association says as american diabetes association says all under 6.5 all under 6.5 all under 6.5 in fact if you see the chart in fact if you see the chart in fact if you see the chart is 6.5 a1c is as bad a1c is as bad as a a1c of 9.7 or 9.8 9.7 or 9.8 so if your a1c is 9.7 so if your a1c is 9.7 so if your a1c is 9.7 with low dose of medication or no dose with low dose of medication or no dose with low dose of medication or no dose of medication of medication of medication but it is 6.5 but it is 6.5 but it is 6.5 with high dose of medication you are with high dose of medication you are with high dose of medication you are better off better off better off not taking that medication because that not taking that medication because that not taking that medication because that high dose of medication high dose of medication high dose of medication is making you as likely to die as that is making you as likely to die as that is making you as likely to die as that low dose of medication low dose of medication low dose of medication the same thing is the the curve is the same thing is the the curve is the same thing is the the curve is steeper for those who are taking insulin steeper for those who are taking insulin steeper for those who are taking insulin so if you're taking insulin so if you're taking insulin so if you're taking insulin and your a1c is 6.5 and your a1c is 6.5 and your a1c is 6.5 that is as bad as not taking insulin and that is as bad as not taking insulin and that is as bad as not taking insulin and having an a1c of 10.5 you can see the having an a1c of 10.5 you can see the having an a1c of 10.5 you can see the 6.5 and 10.5 in the same line 6.5 and 10.5 in the same line 6.5 and 10.5 in the same line they are they are they are equally equally equally harmful or beneficial whatever you want harmful or beneficial whatever you want harmful or beneficial whatever you want to say to say to say so if you can have the same so if you can have the same so if you can have the same level of benefit level of benefit level of benefit without insulin by keeping it at 10.5 without insulin by keeping it at 10.5 without insulin by keeping it at 10.5 why take insulin and keep it at 6.5 why take insulin and keep it at 6.5 why take insulin and keep it at 6.5 because insulin has many other problems because insulin has many other problems because insulin has many other problems many problems okay many problems okay many problems okay and and we don't have time to discuss and and we don't have time to discuss and and we don't have time to discuss that we discussed such subjects under that we discussed such subjects under that we discussed such subjects under our normal course our normal course our normal course this was a very large study 28 000 this was a very large study 28 000 this was a very large study 28 000 patients patients patients and this study had to be stopped because and this study had to be stopped because and this study had to be stopped because too many people too many people too many people who were taking insulin were dying who were taking insulin were dying who were taking insulin were dying because of that high insulin dosages because of that high insulin dosages because of that high insulin dosages and and so they had to tell them they and and so they had to tell them they and and so they had to tell them they had said it would be unethical to had said it would be unethical to had said it would be unethical to continue this study and they had to stop continue this study and they had to stop continue this study and they had to stop that study that study that study sooner sooner sooner okay next slide please okay a lot of people talk to me and say okay a lot of people talk to me and say how about ayurveda and shouldn't one be how about ayurveda and shouldn't one be how about ayurveda and shouldn't one be taking ayurvedic medicine i put this taking ayurvedic medicine i put this taking ayurvedic medicine i put this slide here just to make a point that as slide here just to make a point that as slide here just to make a point that as per ayurveda per ayurveda per ayurveda when diet is wrong medicine is of no use when diet is wrong medicine is of no use when diet is wrong medicine is of no use and when diet is and when diet is and when diet is correct correct correct medicine is of no need medicine is of no need medicine is of no need so taking ayurvedic medicine is a so taking ayurvedic medicine is a so taking ayurvedic medicine is a contradiction in itself contradiction in itself contradiction in itself you must you must you must live healthy live healthy live healthy and you and you and you should not take any medicine should not take any medicine should not take any medicine whether ayurvedic or allopathic or whether ayurvedic or allopathic or whether ayurvedic or allopathic or homeopathic the whole concept of taking homeopathic the whole concept of taking homeopathic the whole concept of taking medicine is flawed medicine is flawed medicine is flawed you must you must you must let the food be your medicine that is let the food be your medicine that is let the food be your medicine that is the whole idea and the food needs to be the whole idea and the food needs to be the whole idea and the food needs to be plant-based plant-based plant-based whole food whole food whole food when you have plant-based whole food when you have plant-based whole food when you have plant-based whole food you're eating in a narrow eating window you're eating in a narrow eating window you're eating in a narrow eating window of eight hours every day of eight hours every day of eight hours every day your remaining physically active your remaining physically active your remaining physically active walking 10 000 steps a day walking 10 000 steps a day walking 10 000 steps a day as the human body was intended as the human body was intended as the human body was intended and fasting every two weeks and once a and fasting every two weeks and once a and fasting every two weeks and once a year for eight days you will not be year for eight days you will not be year for eight days you will not be sick and this is sick and this is sick and this is the feedback i have received the feedback i have received the feedback i have received from about 23 000 from about 23 000 from about 23 000 members and they all report members and they all report members and they all report most of them who follow some don't most of them who follow some don't most of them who follow some don't follow or make too many exceptions follow or make too many exceptions follow or make too many exceptions which is a different problem all which is a different problem all which is a different problem all together together together all right next slide now this is what is happening to your now this is what is happening to your arteries your blood arteries your blood arteries your blood vessels vessels vessels if you are eating plant-based food if you are eating plant-based food if you are eating plant-based food you don't see any plaque on the internal you don't see any plaque on the internal you don't see any plaque on the internal lining of blood vessels lining of blood vessels lining of blood vessels when you eat vegetarian food and you add when you eat vegetarian food and you add when you eat vegetarian food and you add uh dairy and yogurt and cheese to your uh dairy and yogurt and cheese to your uh dairy and yogurt and cheese to your food food food uh you develop uh you develop uh you develop inflammation and plaque begins to inflammation and plaque begins to inflammation and plaque begins to develop but develop but develop but not too much if you are a meat eater a not too much if you are a meat eater a not too much if you are a meat eater a lot of plaque develops okay because the lot of plaque develops okay because the lot of plaque develops okay because the food causes inflammation food causes inflammation food causes inflammation to cure inflammation the blood needs to cure inflammation the blood needs to cure inflammation the blood needs cholesterol it's like a like a mulham a cholesterol it's like a like a mulham a cholesterol it's like a like a mulham a ointment ointment ointment when your child falls and scratches his when your child falls and scratches his when your child falls and scratches his knee you put an ointment on that knee you put an ointment on that knee you put an ointment on that knee knee knee to to to to make it heal that is similarly your to make it heal that is similarly your to make it heal that is similarly your body puts a ointment of cholesterol body puts a ointment of cholesterol body puts a ointment of cholesterol when a food when a food when a food which is inflammatory is causing which is inflammatory is causing which is inflammatory is causing inflammation in your blood vessel lining so i've demonstrated that that this is so i've demonstrated that that this is how how how blood pressure increases when the blood pressure increases when the blood pressure increases when the effective opening goes down effective opening goes down effective opening goes down to circulate same amount of blood you to circulate same amount of blood you to circulate same amount of blood you have to increase the pressure and that's have to increase the pressure and that's have to increase the pressure and that's what your body does what your body does what your body does it compensates because it cannot allow it compensates because it cannot allow it compensates because it cannot allow blood circulation to go down blood circulation to go down blood circulation to go down blood has to be circulated to provide blood has to be circulated to provide blood has to be circulated to provide nutrition to every cell nutrition to every cell nutrition to every cell so it just simply compensates by so it just simply compensates by so it just simply compensates by increasing blood pressure increasing blood pressure increasing blood pressure when you do eat those leafy green when you do eat those leafy green when you do eat those leafy green vegetables they act as roto-rooter and vegetables they act as roto-rooter and vegetables they act as roto-rooter and they clean they clean they clean your blood your blood your blood vessels internal vessels internal vessels internal lining lining lining and and it clears up and and it clears up and and it clears up and and within three to six months in and and within three to six months in and and within three to six months in fact you will see blood pressure go down fact you will see blood pressure go down fact you will see blood pressure go down within two weeks within two weeks within two weeks those people who are doing narrative those people who are doing narrative those people who are doing narrative fasting should be able to see their fasting should be able to see their fasting should be able to see their blood pressure go down blood pressure go down blood pressure go down by the ninth day by the ninth day by the ninth day of course after the ninth day they still of course after the ninth day they still of course after the ninth day they still should continue eating healthy food should continue eating healthy food should continue eating healthy food they can have three meals a day but they they can have three meals a day but they they can have three meals a day but they all should be healthy means otherwise all should be healthy means otherwise all should be healthy means otherwise the plaque will come back up the plaque will come back up the plaque will come back up but this is how blood pressure increases but this is how blood pressure increases but this is how blood pressure increases next slide please so this is the blood pressure guidelines so this is the blood pressure guidelines there was a committee there's a that was there was a committee there's a that was there was a committee there's a that was established back in established back in established back in 1970s a joint national committee which a joint national committee which came up with recommendations for blood came up with recommendations for blood came up with recommendations for blood pressure guidelines in 2014 pressure guidelines in 2014 pressure guidelines in 2014 the last committee the last time the the last committee the last time the the last committee the last time the committee met they came up with the committee met they came up with the committee met they came up with the guidelines they became more lenient this guidelines they became more lenient this guidelines they became more lenient this is all that realization that i talked is all that realization that i talked is all that realization that i talked about as the j curve or hockey curve about as the j curve or hockey curve about as the j curve or hockey curve and they said that for people who are and they said that for people who are and they said that for people who are under the age of 60 under the age of 60 under the age of 60 your normal bp is 140 over 90. so if your normal bp is 140 over 90. so if your normal bp is 140 over 90. so if your bp is your bp is your bp is 140 over 90 or less you should not be 140 over 90 or less you should not be 140 over 90 or less you should not be taking medication taking medication taking medication if you're taking medication if you're taking medication if you're taking medication that medication is increasing that medication is increasing that medication is increasing the chances of death the chances of death the chances of death by all causes so your all-cause by all causes so your all-cause by all causes so your all-cause mortality will increase mortality will increase mortality will increase if you're taking medication if you're taking medication if you're taking medication while your bp is under 140 over 90. now while your bp is under 140 over 90. now while your bp is under 140 over 90. now i know for sure i know for sure i know for sure the many who are attending this talk the many who are attending this talk the many who are attending this talk are in that situation are in that situation are in that situation you are taking medication because your you are taking medication because your you are taking medication because your doctor has not told you about this doctor has not told you about this doctor has not told you about this okay okay okay and and and when when when and then if you're over 60 your normal and then if you're over 60 your normal and then if you're over 60 your normal is 150 over 90. is 150 over 90. is 150 over 90. and a lot of people i and a lot of people i and a lot of people i who come to me and my groups who come to me and my groups who come to me and my groups they say that they're they say that they're they say that they're they're taking medication and they're they're taking medication and they're they're taking medication and they're maintaining maintaining maintaining a a a bp level of 125 over 85 or something bp level of 125 over 85 or something bp level of 125 over 85 or something like that which is quite ridiculous like that which is quite ridiculous like that which is quite ridiculous frankly frankly frankly and and so and and so and and so if you can get this message if you can get this message if you can get this message please uh please uh please uh read about it read about it read about it and and and and and and and and and and i can assure that most people after and i can assure that most people after and i can assure that most people after navratri fast navratri fast navratri fast if you follow the fast properly if you follow the fast properly if you follow the fast properly you will come within this range you will come within this range you will come within this range if you're over 60 your bp will come if you're over 60 your bp will come if you're over 60 your bp will come under 150 over 90. under 150 over 90. under 150 over 90. if you're under 60 it'll be under 140 if you're under 60 it'll be under 140 if you're under 60 it'll be under 140 over 90. next slide please here is the revised guidelines which here is the revised guidelines which were issued on march 6 2018 american college of physician recommends american college of physician recommends moderate blood sugar control targets for moderate blood sugar control targets for

        "content": "•COFFEE DURING FAST?•\nAn often asked question is whether drinking black coffee is okay during fasting periods. Many doctors do allow black coffee and I also have in the past allowed this exception. Part of the reason is that people are so dependent on coffee for their bowl movement that without it they can’t extend their eating window for proper adherence to 16:8 intermittent fasting. Also caffeine addiction causes headache withdrawal symptom making it difficult to fast. I want to address this issue today and revise my recommendation.\nDrinking coffee empty stomach is not a good idea as it can cause many problems. Here are some explanations:\n(1) Even though black coffee doesn’t have any calories and should not interrupt ketosis during fasting window, it does reset the circadian clock. So for daily 16:8 intermittent fasting it should not be consumed during fasting window.\n(2) One objective of fasting is to provide complete rest to the digestive system and secretive glands. Drinking coffee interrupts this and gets the glands to secrete hormones and digestive fluids. If causes liver to release sugar. These disrupt the rejuvenation process. It is also true with the consumption of other additives like lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, Methi seeds, Amla extract etc. I suggest you avoid adding anything to your water during fasts.\n(3) Stomach has hydrochloric acid which helps digest food. Drinking coffee empty stomach increases acidity. This can lead to heartburn, acid reflux, irritable bowl syndrome and stomach ulcers.\n(4) Caffeine on empty stomach releases cortisol and adrenal hormones raising heart rate and blood pressure. This gives signal to liver to release blood sugar to assist in fight or flight response. This is the reason you feel perked up, but in the long run it is unhealthy as it interferes with your natural circadian rhythm.\n(5) Caffeine in Coffee leads to anxiety because you lower your brain’s power to properly breakdown serotonin which is the hormone that keeps you calm and  happy. It can also lead to depression.\n(6) Reduced serotonin production can affect sleep because body changes serotonin into melatonin at night. This is why coffee impacts one’s ability to sleep at night.\n(7) Coffee is diuretic and increases the amount of fluid the body passes which can lead to dehydration.\nFor all these reasons it is advisable to drink coffee during your eating window with breakfast or lunch. One should avoid coffee after 4:00 PM as it has a half life of 6 hours and it might affect your sleep. Most things discussed in this post also apply to tea but to a somewhat lower extent.\nPLEASE AVOID COFFEE DURING ALL FASTS AND DAILY FASTING WINDOW.",

Then after sunset they take their second meal. The gap between the meals is about 12 hours.\nA Fasting Study at UC SanDiego\ndemonstrated that intermittent fasting similar to Ramadan fasting changes proteome signature in human body by changing gene expression, lowering proteins associated with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Alzheimer’s, metabolic syndrome and bipolar disease and depression.",

        "content": "•3rd Pillar of Health•\nCIRCADIAN  RHYTHM\nThe third pillar of health is maintaining our circadian rhythm in sync with the day and night cycle of nature. The timing of our daily activities like eating, exercising, spending time outdoors, and sleeping plays a key role in our well-being. All mammals, including humans, evolved on a 24-hour day/night cycle. This has led to the creation of an internal clock in each cell that dictates the essential functions and processes of that cell during the daily 24-hour cycle. These are called circadian rhythms, and they play a key role in various aspects of physical and mental health. The word \"circadian\" comes from the Latin phrase “circa diem,” which means “around a day.” Circadian rhythms exist in most living organisms, including plants, helping them breathe in CO2 during the day and oxygen at night. In humans, circadian rhythms coordinate mental and physical systems throughout the body. The digestive system produces proteins to match the typical timing of meals, and the endocrine system regulates hormones to suit normal energy expenditure. Circadian rhythms ensure that the body’s processes are optimized at various points during a 24-hour period.\nIt is important to note that the term \"biological clock,\" although often used interchangeably with circadian rhythm, is not the same. Biological clocks help regulate the timing of bodily processes, including circadian rhythms. A circadian rhythm is an effect of a biological clock, but not all biological clocks are circadian. Some operate on lunar or seasonal cycles.\nCortisol & Melatonin\nTwo important hormones released by the body are cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol is released in the morning, with its levels rising with sunrise and staying high until sunset. It is called the \"get up and go\" hormone as it promotes activity. Melatonin rises after sunset and stays high throughout the night. It is a hormone that slows us down and prepares us for the sleep cycle. These two hormones counteract each other and determine our circadian rhythm.\nHow Does Circadian Rhythm Work?\nThe circadian rhythms throughout the body are connected to a master clock, sometimes referred to as the circadian pacemaker, located in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. At different times of the day, clock genes in the SCN send signals to regulate activity throughout the body. Various systems of the body synchronize with this master clock. The master clock synchronizes itself to nature’s clock via multiple mechanisms that we have only recently begun to understand.\nThe SCN is highly sensitive to light, which serves as a critical external cue that influences the signals sent by the SCN to coordinate internal clocks in the body. For this reason, circadian rhythms are closely connected to day and night. Other cues, like food intake, exercise, social activity, and temperature, can affect the master clock. Light has the most powerful influence on circadian rhythms.\nMelanopsin Protein\nThere is a protein called melanopsin, discovered less than 20 years ago, which has a light-sensing mechanism and is present only in about 5,000 neurons of each eye. These neurons are hardwired to the master clock in the brain. Through these cells, we perceive daylight and adjust our master clock in the brain.\nIn 2017, Nobel laureates Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W. Young discovered how plants, animals, and humans adapt their biological rhythms to synchronize with the Earth’s rotations. They isolated a gene called \"Period\" that controls the normal daily biological rhythm. They showed that this gene encodes a protein called Per that accumulates in the cell during the night and degrades during the day. There is also a gene called \"Timeless\" which makes a protein called Tim during daytime, that combines with Per to enter the nucleus of the cell and help maintain the cycle.\nOur inner clock adapts our physiology not only to the dramatically different phases of day and night but also to the various phases within day and night. Many of our genes are regulated by the biological clock, and a carefully calibrated circadian rhythm adapts our physiology to the different phases of the day. The clock regulates various functions like hormone levels, sleep, body temperature, metabolism, and even behavior.\nOur health is affected when there is a temporary mismatch between the external clock and this internal biological clock, as in the case of jet lag. When this misalignment becomes chronic, it can lead to chronic diseases. In recent years, circadian biology has developed into a separate research field, with implications for our health and wellness. Besides daylight, other external factors that affect the master clock include:\n1. Sleep Patten\nOne of the most important and well-known circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle. When properly aligned, a circadian rhythm can promote consistent and restorative sleep. But when this circadian rhythm is out of sync, it can create significant sleeping problems, including insomnia.\n2. Blue Light Exposure:\nThe screens used for TV, computer monitors, and cell phones emit blue light and create confusion in the circadian rhythm, making the body think it may still be daytime. It is therefore important to attach a blue light filter to these devices or switch them off at least an hour before bedtime. Most cell phones have this filter built-in and should be set to turn on automatically at night.\n3. Meal Time:\nAfter society’s adoption of artificial light in the last 150 years, we have changed our eating habits, delayed meal times, and added late-night snacking. This is another factor that confuses our body, making it think it is still daytime.\n4. Physical Activity:\nOur body is programmed to engage in physical activity during the daytime, so when we go to the gym and work out after dark, the body gets conflicting signals.\n5. Temperature:\nOur body is programmed to expect cooler temperatures at night, so artificial heating at night can also upset the circadian rhythm. It is therefore recommended to set lower temperatures at night.\nStudies by Dr. Sachin Panda of the Salk Indtitute (affiliated with University of California, San Diego) have shown that when we correct our circadian rhythm our body recovers significantly.\nAs you can see, many of the behaviors that we have modified in the last 150 years, after the development of the electric grid, upset our circadian rhythm and have contributed to the growth of chronic diseases. It is only in the last 15 years that we have paid attention to this field. When we change our lifestyle to align it with our circadian rhythm, the results are remarkable, irrespective of the food we consume. Changes in diet, when combined with circadian rhythm harmony, lead to wonders.\nhttps://youtu.be/erBJuxVR7IE?si=VOsU7Ln_eDT1BzZk\n———————————\nEND OF POST\n———————————",

        "content": "•SLEEP: Why it Matters?\nNearly two out of three people in the U.S. don’t get sufficient sleep, significantly impacting their health. One-third of people sleep six hours or less, double the rate from 50 years ago. The CDC recognizes this as a public health epidemic, with an estimated 60 million Americans suffering from chronic sleep disorders. Children are progressively getting less sleep, averaging two hours less per night compared to a century ago. One in five car crashes in the U.S. is caused by drowsy driving. Here’s what we know about sleep:\nWhy Do We Sleep?\n1. Brain Maintenance:\nThe brain, which consumes 25% of the body’s energy, produces metabolic waste that must be removed. Cerebral spinal fluid flushes out waste like beta-amyloids during deep sleep. Accumulation of these wastes can lead to diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Besides removing toxins during sleep the brain repairs brain cells, prunes connections, and transfers short-term memory into long-term memory. It also integrates daily learning, especially perceptual learning, with prior experiences.\n2.Energy Replenishment:\nSleep replenishes energy sources. Tiredness builds up Adenosine levels in the brain leading to involuntary sleep, which is dangerous while driving. Caffeine temporarily blocks this signal but does not prevent it.\n3.Cognitive Function:\nLack of sleep impairs concentration, logical thinking, memory, focus, attention, and alertness. It also triples reaction times, contributing to auto accidents.\n4.Health Impact:\nSleep affects the cardiovascular system, including heart function and blood pressure. Sleep deprivation is linked to high BP, weakened immune systems, increased infections, and cancer progression.\n5.Appetite Regulation:\nSleep deprivation disrupts appetite regulation, leading to overeating and increased obesity.\n6.Increased Insulin Resistance:\nIt also makes insulin less effective, raising blood sugar levels, and contributing to type-2 diabetes. Sleep-deprived college students showed a 40% reduction in glucose clearance rates and a 30% decrease in insulin response. Fat cells from sleep-deprived people have poor glucose response.\n7.Immunization Impact:\nSleep deprivation reduces vaccination benefits. In a study, one night of sleep deprivation after Hepatitis vaccination resulted in 49% reduction in HPAV antibodies after 4 weeks.\n8.Emotional Health:\nSleep deprivation is linked to increased anxiety, depression, and volatile behavior. It is also associated with ADHD in children and marital discord due to a tendency to remember negative words more than positive ones. One in five high school boys in the US is diagnosed with ADHD. Studies show that sleep deprived people are twice as likely to remember negative words than positive words. This explains some of the marital discords.\n9.Circadian Rhythm:\nBoth sleep deficits and misalignment of circadian rhythm contribute to health problems. Sleep apnea increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 420%, and sleeping less than six hours a night raises stroke risk by 4.5 times. A rare sleep disorder called Fatal Familial Insomnia leads to dementia and death.\n10.Miscellaneous:\nHeavy physical labor does not require extra sleep, while emotional stress may. Activities that increase core body temperature, like exercise or a hot bath, can facilitate sleep. Waking during the night is common and not necessarily indicative of disturbed sleep. Those who can \"sleep anywhere anytime\" are likely sleep deprived.\nHOW MUCH SLEEP?\nA typical adult needs 7-9 hours of sleep and an adolescent needs 8-10 hours of sleep. Children need more. There are personal differences, but no adult needs less than 6 hours and any claims to the contrary are only reflection of their ignorance. Adverse effects to sleeping less are well understood but are there adverse health effects of sleeping too much? Over sleeping is not natural. Sleeping over 10 hours a night is abnormal. Studies have shown that subjects who were asked to sleep 14 hours at night could not sleep that much after the first few days. Once they have made up for a sleep deficit, it is not possible to sleep more and accumulate a surplus. Many people who claim to need less sleep, when brought under a controlled study, are surprised to find how their sleep duration expanded when the light and clocks are removed from their environment.\nSleep Deficiency\nHealth consequences of sleep deficiency include following:\n- Higher Inflammation\n- Weight Gain & Obesity\n- Diabetes Risk\n- Cardio Vascular Disease\n- Cancer Risk\n- Reduced Immunity\n- Hormonal ImbalanceLack of Concentration\n- Hyperactivity\n- Emotional Instability\n- Depression & Burnout\nNAPPING\n1. Napping is very beneficial and it can help make up for sleep deficit at night. Hour for hour it is just as effective as sleep at night. However it does not help remove any circadian rhythm imbalances.\n2. When it comes to memory processing, a 90 minute nap is as beneficial as a 6 hour sleep at night. However we don’t have data for immune function, endocrine function, hormonal function, clearance of toxins etc.\n3. A good time to nap is early afternoon and not late afternoon.\n4. If a person wakes up naturally at the time they need to wake up, they probably get enough sleep. Do they sleep longer on the weekends ? If so, they likely don’t get enough sleep during the week.\nSLEEP DISORDERS\nHere are some common sleep disorders.\n(1) Insomnia:\nThis refers to difficulty in falling asleep. There can be many causes like\n- Acute stress\n- Alcohol or caffeine\n- Circadian imbalance\n- Medical or neurological factors\n- Psychiatric disorders\n(2) Parasomnia:\nThis refers to unusual behavior at night.\n- Non REM Parasomnia like sleep walking or nightmares.\n- REM Sleep Behavior Disorders\n(3) Hypersomnia:\nExcessive Daytime Sleeping\ncan be due to any of the following major causes:\n- Insufficient quantity of sleep at night\n- Poor quality of sleep\n- Sleep Apnea\n- Pathological disorders like Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Insomnia.\n- Medical or Psychiatric disorders like thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effects or mood disorders\n- Circadian Rhythm disorders like night shift job and jet lag.\n(4) Sleep Apnea:\nThis is a sleep related breathing disorder. With this condition, people snore very loudly and stop breathing in the middle of their sleep.\n(5)  Restless Leg Syndrome:\nThis is classified as a sleep related movement disorder and involves periodic limb movement.\nCAUSES OF SLEEP DISORDERS\n1. Melatonin deficiency\n2. Caffeine and/or alcohol\n3. Watching blue light emitting screens like TV, computer and cell phones before bedtime\n4. Eating late dinners after it is dark outside\n5. Snacking after dinner\n6. Bright light and warm temperature\n7. Erratic timing of sleep\nAs you can see there are many sleep disorders some are clearly due to diet and lifestyle but all may not be. If these persist even after making modifications in diet and lifestyle, one should consult a specialist.\nMELATONIN\nMelatonin, a hormone produced in the pineal gland and enterochromaffin cells in the gut, is typically released after sunset. Traditionally known as a sleep hormone, recent research reveals its broader roles, especially in the body's rejuvenation.\nThere are two types of melatonin: circulating melatonin, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by darkness, and subcellular melatonin, found in mitochondria and protecting against oxidation and free radical damage. Subcellular melatonin is now considered primary, with pineal gland melatonin as a backup. Insufficient melatonin can disrupt sleep, increase inflammation, and reduce antioxidant protection, impacting conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Melatonin deficiency is linked to Sundown Syndrome in dementia and Alzheimer’s patients, characterized by agitation and fatigue at sunset.\nMelatonin production is stimulated by darkness and infrared light but inhibited by brightness and blue light. Near-infrared (NIR) waves from the sun, comprising about 50% of solar energy, are major stimulants of subcellular melatonin. Historically, infrared exposure came from wooden fires, now replaced by fluorescent lights, which lack this benefit. Clouds and grass reflect infrared rays, making outdoor exposure beneficial even without direct sunlight.\nBesides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, melatonin offers numerous benefits:\n1. Modulates the immune system and is effective against certain viruses.\n2. Is neuroprotective, aiding memory and reducing anxiety and depression.\n3. Controls the release of reproductive hormones in men and women.\n4. Has cardioprotective qualities, lowering blood pressure and improving cholesterol profiles.\n5. Plays a crucial role in insulin production and action, regulating GLUT4 expression, and reducing insulin resistance.\n6. Lower melatonin levels are linked to higher incidences of breast and prostate cancers.\nAs melatonin production decreases with age, dietary sources become important. I do not advise taking melatonin supplements. Melatonin was discovered in plant foods in 1995, with rich sources including pistachios, cranberries, mushrooms, cherries, and walnuts. Consuming just two pistachios a day can suffice. A date-pistachio roll is a recommended dessert after dinner to boost melatonin intake.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Translator: Rhonda Jacobs Reviewer: Peter van de Ven So pathogens like this used to cause infectious diseases that killed humans for centuries. Until sanitation, vaccination and antibiotics took care of pathogens and gave us long, healthy lives. But now, we spend nearly half of our life fighting with these kinds of chronic diseases, and for which there is no cure in sight. So today, I'll share with you some really revolutionary ideas of how to prevent, manage and cure these diseases. And the idea is based on the concepts of circadian rhythm, our near-24-hour rhythms. To adapt to the 24-hour light-dark cycle, or day-night cycle, on our planet, almost every plant and animal has circadian rhythms that are controlled by what we call circadian clocks. These are actually encoded in our DNA. And this is so fundamental to life forms on our planet that if we move any animal or human from this planet to another planet that has identical conditions as the planet Earth but has a day-night cycle other than 24 hours, then we cannot easily survive. In recognition of this fundamental property of circadian clocks and health, this year's Nobel Prize was actually awarded to three scientific leaders in this field. And I'm really honored that all three of them have directly inspired and influenced my research. So how do we know that these clocks are in-built? For example, if you lock me inside an apartment with no clue about outside time, then my circadian clock will make me go to sleep around 10:00 at night. I'll go into deep sleep around 2:00, and anticipating waking up, my body will warm up around 4:00 in the morning. As soon as I wake up and open my eyes, my sleep hormone melatonin will plummet, and my stress hormone cortisol level will rise. My peak performance time for brain will be around noon. And my peak athletic performance will happen around late afternoon. As evening rolls in, the circadian clock will crank up melatonin to make me go to sleep again, and my body will cool down to support my sleep. So this will continue every 24 hours, even if I'm locked inside an apartment. And these rhythms happen because almost every single gene in our genome turns on and off at different times of the day. Every single hormone and brain chemical also rises and falls at different times of the day. So to have these rhythms is actually to have health. And when these rhythms break down, when we stay awake late into the night finishing an assignment or taking care of a loved one, then we feel horrible the next day. And if we continue abusing our clock for weeks or months, then all these chronic diseases can happen. So it's very important, then, to know how are these clocks organized so that we can nurture them much better. So as you can imagine, just like in our brain we have a clock that makes us go to sleep and wake up every day, the same brain clock sends chemical signals to the rest of the body. But what is really surprising is that almost every organ in our body, and even every single cell in our body has its own clock. What does that mean? It means that just like your brain clock makes us more efficient at solving complex problems in the middle of the day, and also the brain needs to sleep at night, every organ has its own peak performance time at certain times of the day. And every organ needs to sleep, or rest and rejuvenate, at another time. So all these clocks work together to give us daily rhythms in sleep, metabolism, mood and even gut microbiome. But how are these clocks connected to the outside world? In fact, every morning as we wake up and open our eyes, bright light goes through our eyes and resets or synchronizes this clock, so that when daylight savings time changes, or when we move from one time zone to another time zone, light synchronizes all of our clocks to the new season or the new time zone. But the property of light that resets our clock is very different. Almost 15 years ago, we discovered a new blue-light-sensing protein called melanopsin. It's present only in 5,000 squiggly neurons in our eye. And these light-sensing neurons are literally hard wired to our brain clock, to the master circadian clock. But they have a very interesting property. They're less sensitive to light, and especially to orange colored light. So that means, in the evening, as we move around and find our way under candle light or dim orange light, the melanopsin is not activated. It sends a signal to the brain as if it's dark outside so that the brain clock makes a lot of melatonin and we get a good night's sleep. And in the daytime as we wake up, go outside for at least an hour or so. The daylight is very rich in blue light. It fully activates melanopsin. That synchronizes the brain clock nicely with the day. It reduces sleepiness and depression, and increases alertness. But the problem is, we spend more than 90 percent of our time indoors. And at nighttime, bright screens and bright light activates melanopsin; it sends a confusing signal to the brain, and the brain thinks it's not night yet, so it produces less melatonin, and we sleep poorly. The next day when we wake up, as we spend most of our time indoors, this indoor light is not rich in blue light, so it again sends another confusing signal to the brain, and the brain thinks it's not day yet. So all the chemicals that should boost our mood are actually not produced enough. So we kind of go back and forth between insomnia and fogginess, and if it continues for weeks or months, then a lot of diseases can happen. And what is interesting is, this is particularly important for children because their brain is still developing. And when children go through early childhood circadian disruption, they are more prone to diseases like ADHD and autism. So this new simple idea, that we need more bright blue light during the daytime and less light, or darkness, at nighttime, is starting a new lighting revolution. And you are just getting a glimpse of this new light revolution when your smart screen and computer screen dim down and turn orange at nighttime. But there is more to it. Just think about it: Circadian lighting at daycare and schools will promote healthy brain development and promote learning. Circadian lighting at home, factories, offices, will promote alertness and improve productivity. Circadian lighting at hospitals or retirement homes will promote health and accelerate healing. And in fact, right now, there is new circadian lighting in our International Space Station to promote productivity of our astronauts and make them have better nights' sleep. So light is not the only factor that affects our clock. In fact, just like light in the middle of the night disturbs the brain clock and breaks the chemical balance in our brain, food at the wrong time can disturb the peripheral clock and break the metabolic balance in our body, and that will push us towards disease. Now, let's figure out how. So in the morning, our stomach is actually ready with the right amount of hormones and digestive enzymes, and even good gut microbiome to digest food. So after we eat our first breakfast, a body absorbs enough carbohydrates and uses it to fuel our body. At the same time, it saves a little bit of nutrient as fat. As we continue at lunch and dinner, the same process continues. And after the last dinner, last bite, a body slowly goes low on carb. At the same time, the circadian clock cranks up morning fat. And after a few hours, the clock turns into a reset and repair rejuvenation mode. That means that it turns on enzymes that will break down cholesterol and toxins. It also turns on mechanisms to repair the DNA that we have damaged during the daytime. And a lot of cells that are damaged on our stomach lining or our skin lining are also replaced with healthy new cells so that allergy-causing chemicals or bacteria cannot get into our body. So after 12 to 16 hours of fasting, when we eat our next breakfast, the cycle of nurture, rejuvenation continues. But imagine if we delay that last bite late into the night. So in this case, this daily rhythm in metabolism becomes shallow. There is not enough time to burn fat, and there is not enough time to break down the toxins, cholesterol, etc. So, you can imagine that somebody who eats within ten hours might have a much better circadian rhythm, whereas somebody who eats within 15 hours may not. To test this idea, we went back to the old lab and brought two identical groups of mice born to the same parents, raised in the same room, same age. And one group of mice got the standard Western diet to eat whenever they wanted. And then the second group was trained to eat the same number of calories from the same food, but they had to eat everything within eight to 12 hours at nighttime when they're supposed to eat. And we measured the food and weighed the mice carefully every week for almost 18 weeks. At the end of 18 weeks, the first group of mice, who ate randomly, were obese, where at the same time, they had a host of different diseases - they were really morbidly sick - where the second group that ate within eight to 12 hours were completely healthy. But what is more surprising is this: If we take those morbidly sick mice and give them the same diet, same number of calories, and they have to eat only within eight to ten hours, they become healthy. This was a really earth-shattering, eureka moment for us, because for the first time in the history of nutrition science, we found that when we eat is as important as what or how much we eat. Well then, how do we translate [that] to humans? The first thing we wanted to know is, when do people eat? To do that, we started a new study - and people usually sign up for the study at mycircadianclock.org - and then, since people love to take pictures, we asked them to take pictures of every single thing that they eat or drink, and we'd do the rest. So when the pictures come to our server, we add them on a timeline so that it's easy for us to figure out when they eat. And they continue taking pictures for almost two to three weeks. So that we can take a nice snapshot of their food life during the weekdays and weekends. And you can see, for this particular person, he or she eats very randomly throughout the day. And if you look at the weekday and weekend pattern, those are also very random. And if you combine the weekday and weekend, there is another interesting thing that comes up. It appears as if the person is on the East coast during the weekday and comes to the West coast on the weekend, which is also very bad for our circadian clock. Now, if we combine all of this data and plot it as if we are looking at a clock, then you can see that this person was eating almost around the clock. He's not an outlier, actually. If we look at the first 150 people who had signed up, nearly 50 percent of adults who actually have regular 8 to 5 jobs, eat for 15 hours or longer. So that means if they have their first bite at 7:00 in the morning, the last bite or last sip of wine happens at 9:00 or later. What is interesting is, if we feed mice even a healthy diet, and they eat for 15 hours or longer, then slowly they become overweight and they get all these diseases. So that's why we wanted to ask a very simple question. We brought back people who were eating for 15 hours and were a little overweight, and asked them to eat whatever they want within ten hours of their own choosing, and we wanted to see what happens to them. So within three to four months, these people actually boosted up their circadian rhythm and they lost the excessive body weight that they had. And over the last one year, we've had thousands of people from all over the world who are signing up either through our study or doing this by themselves. They try to eat all of their food somewhere between 8, 10 or 11 hours. And when they do that, after a few weeks, they're truly amazed by the untapped potential of the healing power of circadian rhythm. Almost all of them lose a little bit of weight, but as they continue, they actually feel much better, more energetic throughout the day. They sleep much better at night, and their mood is much better; they feel very sharp. And slowly, over months, they suffer less from different diseases of the gut, heart, immune system, diabetes and even some of the mental diseases. So we're truly excited about this study, but at the same time, we learned another very important insight, and let me share that with you. That is, circadian clock tunes the potency of almost every drug that we take for almost every disease. So that means, at certain times of the day, the drug is more potent and can cure you, but at the wrong time of the day it can have a more severe adverse effect, as if it's a poison. So this is really important. And the effect is not even [only] to drugs, at what time of the day we take our flu shots, at what time we schedule our surgery for liver or heart, does matter. Even cancer patients who are going through chemotherapy or radiation therapy, it really matters whether they schedule the chemo or radiation in the morning or late in the afternoon. So this new knowledge about circadian rhythm is poised to start a new revolution in healthcare and healthy habits. Because the current idea of taking care of your health by counting calories and counting steps is just prehistoric. And the same software and tools that our tech companies are using to make us watch more arts, sleep less and eat around the clock can be used for something better. We can have devices and sensors that can create a nice circadian lighting environment around us. Sensors can go on us to monitor our own circadian rhythm every day and how it interacts with the real outside world. Devices can prompt us what to eat and when to eat to boost our circadian rhythm. And even there will be smart pills and programmed drug pumps that can deliver the right medicine, at the right dose, at the right time, even in the middle of our sleep, so that we can get cured much faster. So I truly believe that circadian rhythm has untapped potential to prevent, manage and cure many of the chronic diseases that affect billions of people. Thank you. (Applause) (Cheers) Thank you.",

        "content": "4th Pillar of Health: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY\nThe fourth pillar of health is physical activity. Throughout evolution, we needed to walk in search of food and sometimes run to catch a prey or defend ourselves. As a result, our bodies have evolved to depend on mostly moderate physical activity, with occasional strenuous exertion. In modern times, with an abundance of food, these activities are no longer necessary for survival, but they remain crucial for maintaining optimal bodily function. An inactive lifestyle ranks as the fifth leading risk factor for death and the sixth for disability. Dietary risks and smoking are the top two factors for both these risks.\nDiet is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to health. However, after diet, detoxification, and circadian rhythm, physical activity is the fourth most important factor for good health. Most people are aware of the importance of exercise. My goal in this blog is to cover some basic minimum activities and exercises essential for good health.\nWhy Exercise\nBesides its benefits to physical health, exercise positively impacts mental health, cognitive function, sleep quality, cancer prevention, diabetes management, cardiovascular disease (CVD), immune function, blood pressure, and lifespan. Outlined below are some major benefits.\nCardiac Health\nThe most common focus of exercise is on cardiac health. Research shows that the more you walk, the lower your all-cause mortality rate. Walking for 90 minutes a day is better than walking for 60 minutes, which is better than walking for 30 minutes. The speed of walking is important for cardiac workouts. I recommend a pace of 100-130 steps per minute, though this will vary depending on one’s age. The body should reach a stress level of about 85% of its maximum capacity for some duration during the day. To compute your maximum pulse capacity, subtract your age from 220. For example, a 60-year-old would have a maximum pulse rate of 160. The goal should be to reach 85% of that maximum—136 beats per minute—for at least 5 minutes twice daily.\nLymphatic Health\nThe lymphatic system is the body’s janitorial system, collecting and disposing of waste throughout the body. Unfortunately, this benefit of walking is often neglected by most authors. Our lymphatic system does not have a pump, so walking facilitates the flow of lymphatic fluids from our lymph nodes, located near our underarms and upper leg joints. For this benefit, it’s not necessary to climb up the stairs; climbing down is equally effective.\nVertebrae Health\nCertain parts of the body, like the intervertebral discs (IVDs) separating our backbones, lack blood vessels. The only way they get nutrition and excrete waste is through a spongy process—when they’re compressed, waste is excreted, and when they expand, fresh nutrients are absorbed from the bones above and below. This cycle repeats with every step we take. Many media articles questioning the wisdom of 10,000 steps a day miss this critical point.\nOther Benefits\nWalking also offers many other benefits, including:\n- Aiding in weight loss\n- Reducing the risk of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, stroke, and varicose veins\n- Increasing lung capacity\n- Improving mood\n- Boosting immunity\n- Preventing disability in old age\n- Speeding up digestion\nHow Much Exercise\nThe question then arises: how much exercise is ideal? The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, issued by the U.S. government, recommend 150-300 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. This is consistent with previous guidelines advising at least 30 minutes per day. However, these advisories often suffer from a mindset of, “Why advise something that won’t be followed?” As a result, they tone down their recommendations to what they think is achievable rather than informing us of what the science says—this is also common with dietary guidelines.\nA good rule of thumb is to spend 10% of your waking time in movement. This amounts to about 100 minutes a day or approximately 10,000 steps. Ideally, this should be spread throughout the day, and the best way to monitor this is by using a Fitbit or Apple Watch.\nWhile some activities have benefits that lie on a continuum, it helps to pick a number to emphasize the point. Walking is one such activity. It is well established that the more you walk each day, the better it is for your health. Of course, extremes are bad, and the law of diminishing returns applies to all activities. Research has shown that walking for one hour per day is better than walking for half an hour, which is better than 20 minutes, and even that is better than no walking at all. Studies also indicate that walking for an hour and a half each day is better than one hour. There is no research beyond that. Separately, research has shown that walking for five minutes each waking hour is a good target for activity levels. Studies of various Blue Zones, where people live the longest and healthiest lives, have shown that the average number of daily steps people walk in these areas is over 13,000. The figure of 10,000 is just a marker to be used as a guide.\nTypes of Activity\nThe goal should be to stay physically active during waking hours. There are many types of physical activities, such as walking, jogging, running, climbing stairs, cycling, swimming, stationary running, skipping rope, yoga asanas, pranayama, and more. Playing sports is also a great way to stay active and provides mental relaxation.\nVertebrae Movement\nBesides walking, it’s important to move your vertebrae to exercise the muscles that hold your back in place. Some exercises for the back should cover all four types of movements:\n- Forward and backward bending\n- Side bending to the left and right\n- Twisting in both directions\n- Compression and extension\nYoga is the best way to exercise these muscles.\nStrength Training\nStrength training is important for muscle and bone health. Many freehand exercises, like pushups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and squats, can help. Going to the gym is also a good idea for those who have time. However, excessive exercises like HIIT should be avoided.\nYog Asanas\nPracticing yoga asanas is very healthy for the body. Besides providing flexibility and strength, it also stimulates various internal organs and reduces visceral fat\nPranayama\nThe practice of pranayama can significantly improve and maintain health. The role of breathing patterns in health recovery is only now being recognized in the Western world, as demonstrated by the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology for research on how human cells respond to different levels of oxygen.\n10K Walk In Tight Spaces\nIn extreme weather conditions, covering 10,000 steps each day can be challenging. However, there is a way to achieve this in tight spaces by walking in a figure-eight pattern as shown in the diagram below.\nTo summarize, an active lifestyle is key to good health, and it’s best to establish a routine that can be followed regularly\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Pillar 5:  EMOTIONAL & SPIRITUAL HEALTH\nThe fifth pillar of health is Emotional & Spiritual Health. The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental drive shared by all living organisms, from single cells to the largest blue whales. For over a century, it was believed that happiness was experienced primarily at the brain level, leading to the development of psychology as a field to understand mental malfunctions. However, recent research has shown that this is not entirely true; every cell in the human body seeks happiness and compensates under conditions of adversity.\n5.1 Emotional Health\nWe’ve all heard stories about positive thinking and mind over matter. Every cell in our body is a living organism that behaves as if it has a mind of its own. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology was awarded to J.C. Hall, M. Rosbash, and M.W. Young for their research on how our circadian clock functions at the cellular level. The 2019 Nobel Prize was given to W.G. Kaelin, G.L. Semenza, and P.J. Ratcliffe for their work demonstrating how cells respond to the level of oxygen in our blood.\nHormones play a crucial role in determining our emotional health, while emotions influence the functioning of our endocrine glands, which release hormones. This interdependence significantly impacts our health, and science has only just begun to scratch the surface of understanding it. There is still much more to learn.\nPlacebo and Nocebo Effects\nThe placebo effect has been known for over a century, and the entire field of homeopathy relies on it. \"Placebo\" in Latin means “I shall be acceptable or pleasing.” When we take a pill believing it to be medicine, we can experience healing, even if the pill is just sugar. Clearly, it is not the sugar that cures the illness but the conscious belief that healing will occur. The reverse of this is known as the nocebo effect, which has only recently garnered significant attention from researchers. \"Nocebo\" in Latin means “I shall cause harm.” Negative thoughts can be as powerful as positive ones in affecting our bodies, but in the opposite direction. If you believe something bad will happen, it’s quite likely that it will. The concept of a curse, or \"shrap\" in Hindu mythology, operates on this principle. Happy people tend to have happy thoughts, which lead to healthy bodies, while sorrow and self-pity often result in poor health.\nConcept of Rasas\nIn our younger days, we learned about the concept of various rasas (moods) in Hindi literature:\n1. Shanti: Peace\n2. Bhakti: Devotion\n3. Karuna: Pathos\n4. Hasya: Laughter\n5. Sringaar: Love, Romance, Beauty\n6. Veer: Courage and Bravery\n7. Adbhut: Wonderment\n8. Raudra: Anger\n9. Bhayanak: Fear\n10. Vibhatsya: Hatred\nWe now understand that these emotions impact the functioning of our hormonal glands, which release different hormones into the bloodstream, affecting our physical health. This is essentially what is meant by the power of positive and negative thinking.\nResearch Findings\nIt is widely accepted now that laughter is the best medicine. We’ve heard this time and again, but what we may not realize is that every single emotion has an impact on our body—every feeling has physical consequences. Here are some examples, all proven by various studies:\n- When we are in love, even water tastes sweet. Love is also a potent painkiller and can improve memory.\n- Anger leads to insomnia by increasing blood circulation to the lymph nodes and heart, which prevents sleep. It also results in high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and a weakened immune system.\n- Powerlessness makes everything feel heavy.\n- Loneliness and sadness can make people feel cold, increase appetite, and lead to weight gain.\n- Feeling offended can cause acne.\n- Disgust can upset the stomach.\n- A fit of giggles can reduce stress hormone levels.\n- Laughter reduces the risk of heart attacks by lowering stress hormones.\n- Jealousy, a mix of anger, stress, and fear, increases adrenaline levels increasing heart rate, and blood pressure while weakening the immune system.\n- Crying expels stress chemicals (except those triggered by cutting onions). Suppressing tears can ruin digestion and weaken the immune system.\n- Fear makes us pale by redirecting blood to the muscles for a fight-or-flight response.\n- Praising your partner can lower cholesterol levels.\n- Shame increases the stress hormone cortisol, which can constrict arteries and raise heart rate.\n- Arguing produces more cytokines, which can slow down the healing process. High levels of cytokines can lead to cancer, heart disease, and arthritis.\n- Short-term stress can strengthen the immune system and help fight cancer, but chronic stress can impair memory and lead to diabetes and heart disease.\nHappiness Chemicals\nThere are four primary chemicals in our body that affect happiness: dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins.\nDopamine\nThis is the “feel-good” hormone, released when we eat desired food or engage in sex. However, it’s more accurate to say that dopamine is involved with anticipation rather than the actual feeling of happiness. It boosts mood, motivation, and attention and helps regulate emotional responses. It is often described as a striving emotion.\nOxytocin\nThis is the neurochemical that enables us to be social creatures. It fosters empathy, helping us feel close and bonded to others when released. Oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland.\nSerotonin\nThis is the hormone that helps regulate mood and social behavior, appetite and digestion, sleep, memory and sexual desire and function. A link is also suspected between serotonin and depression. Eighty percent of serotonin exists in the gut, and is governed by one’s state of hunger (yes, this is why you’re hungry).\nEndorphins\nThese act as analgesics, reducing the perception of pain or discomfort. This explains their association with the “fight or flight” response. When pursuing happiness, endorphins help you “power through.” For example, they enable runners to push further and harder towards their goals.\nSome of the natural ways  to boost Happiness hormones are:\n* Listening to Music\n* Eating Carbs\n* Spending Time with loved ones\n* Physical Exercise and Yoga\n* Pranayama\n* Meditation\n* Prayers\n* Helping others through social work\n(I’ve let the secret out—now you know why I run these health blogs.)\nGeeta’s Teachings\nThe entire discussion in the Geeta about the three types of personalities (gunas)—Satwic (purity), Rajsic (passion), and Tamsic (inertia)—makes sense. Chapter 14 of the Bhagavad Geeta is devoted to this subject. Similarly, in Ayurveda, people are classified into three main types: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Western medicine now recognizes that people can be divided into three types based on their gut microbiome. While these classifications are not identical, they illustrate that the differentiation among types of people is gaining acceptance. Our gut-brain connection is now well recognized, with the gut even being called the second brain.\nOur diet and lifestyle affect the hormonal balance in our body, which in turn influences our psyche and actions. This concept is covered to some extent in all religious scriptures. I quote here verse 5 from Chapter 14 of the Geeta:\n“Sattva (purity), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia) - these gunas (qualities), O Arjun, are born of Prakrti (nature) and they bind the indestructible soul (consciousness within us) to the body”.\nThis is my favorite subject, and as you can see, I am passionate about it, having spent 14 years under the tutelage of Swami Chinmayananda.\n————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————",

        "content": "Pillar 5.2: SPIRITUAL HEALTH\nThe human pursuit to understand the nature of things has been eternal. Approximately 2,500 years ago, this quest for knowledge split into two disciplines: philosophy and science. At that time, India was the wealthiest country, and Takshshila was the world's largest university, attracting scholars from all over the world.\nThe credit given to Thales of Miletus as the father of modern science may be due to Western bias or the result of 1,000 years of oppression in India by invading cultures. Regardless, it is fascinating to note the convergence of modern science and Indian philosophy after 2,500 years. This topic was thoroughly explored by Fritjof Capra in his 1975 book, The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism. I highly recommend it.\nIn matters of health and psychology, medical science is still trying to catch up with Ayurveda and the teachings of the Upanishads and Geeta. If it weren't for the greed of the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, we might have seen the light many decades ago.\nThe power of prayer has also gained acceptance within the scientific community. That you pray is important; who you pray to is irrelevant. What matters is that your mind becomes flooded with a sense of reverence and gratitude. Feelings of gratitude trigger the release of the oxytocin hormone which decreases blood pressure, strengthens the immune system, and speeds up the body's healing processes. To illustrate this point, I will share my favorite couplet from Sant Kabir:\n“Dukh me sumiran sab karen, Sukh me karen na koi ,\nJo sukh me sumirun kare, dukh kahe ko hoi.”\n\"Everyone prays when they are unhappy.\nNo one prays when they are happy.\nThose who pray when they are happy\nNever experience unhappiness.\"\nThis verse is often misunderstood because we attribute *sukh* (happiness) to material gain, leading to disappointment when those material gains do not materialize. We often forget that we seek material gain only because we believe it will bring us happiness, and its absence will cause unhappiness. Happiness is our true goal. When we pray in the true spirit, seeking nothing but happiness, it comes to us naturally—like a five-year-old who, after feverishly chasing a butterfly, finds it gently resting on his hand once he sits down tired.\nMy humble suggestion is that when you pray, never ask for material gains; simply ask that the results (outcomes) lead you to the path of happiness. Similarly, if you are blessing someone, wish for them to find happiness in whatever life has in store for them. Do not say, \"May your wishes come true,\" because in their ignorance, they might wish for material gain, which may or may not bring them happiness.\nWhen we pray with a sense of gratitude, the release of oxytocin in our body brings happiness. This creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging us to pursue this path more strongly. When we change our diet to a plant-based whole food (PBWF) approach, start intermittent fasting, and walk 10,000 steps a day, changes occur not only in our body but also in our psyche. Plant-based whole foods are what Krishna refers to as *Satvic* in the Geeta. Satvic foods bring forth Satvic thoughts, which are positive and promote happiness by releasing the “happiness hormones.\"\nWhen we engage in action for the sake of action, without attachment to the outcome, the process of acting becomes joyful because there is no anxiety about the result. Whether we reach the target or not becomes secondary. When our sole focus is on achieving the target and we miss it, we feel disappointed and miserable, which negatively affects our health. This is the essence of the teachings of the Geeta, beautifully summarized in verse 2:47:\n“कर्मण्ये वाधिका रस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन।\nमा कर्म फल हेतु र्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्व कर्मणि॥\nKarmanye vadhika raste, Ma phaleshu kadachana,\nMa karma phala hetur bhurma te sangotsva karmani”\n“You have a right to work only, but never to any results thereof (fruits of action). You should never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to inaction (laziness).”\nWhen it comes to our children, we often advise them, \"Enjoy the game and play your best; it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose.\" Yet in our own lives, we often forget this advice.\nPower of Concentration\nA common question is: why should I meditate? Why should I spend 20 minutes each morning concentrating and thinking about nothing? This is a valid question for a newcomer who has not yet experienced the power of concentration. Professor Martin Seligman, the President of the American Psychological Association 25 years ago, raised a valid question: why are psychologists only studying psychotics, maladjusted people and not well-adjusted, happy people? His work focused on happy people, leading to the development of a new field of psychology called “Positive Psychology.”\nAnother psychology professor, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, conducted extensive research on this subject and interviewed many of the most successful people across various fields. He wrote a book titled Flow, named after a famous music composer who described a state of \"flow\" experienced while conducting a challenging symphony. In this state, he became so engrossed that he felt beyond his body, with his hands moving automatically. This book is worth reading, as it explains why deep concentration brings maximum happiness. Coming from Western scientists, this explanation adds validity to the experiences our ancestral masters must have felt when writing the Yoga Sutras, the Geeta and the Upanishads. In Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra, he discussed the eight limbs of yoga, with the sixth limb being *Dharana*, which means concentration. Deep concentration leads to meditation, and deep meditation leads to *Samadhi*, a state of bliss where one’s consciousness transcends the body.\nIn 1969, when I was at IIT Kanpur, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi came to give talks on Transcendental Meditation and initiated some of us who were interested. It had a profound effect on me and instilled a lifelong habit.

        "content": "SPIRITUAL HEALTH: YOG\nWhat is Yog (also written as Yoga) and how is it relevant in contemporary society? We will explore this topic in this blog post.\nToday, with the worldwide spread of Yog, it has become a generic term describing many pursuits ranging from simple physical exercises to an elaborate set of principles dictating how we live our lives. The sculptures of Mohenjodaro and Harappa are a testament to the practice of Yog 5,000 years ago. There are references to Yog in the Vedas, and, in fact, there are 20 Upanishads dedicated to it, 11 of which are in the Atharva Veda alone. The best known among them is the Yogatattva Upanishad from the Atharva Veda. In this Upanishad Vishnu states to Brahma that Yog is one, but there are various kinds in practice, the chief among these are of four types:\n* Mantra Yog: The practice through chants.\n* Laya Yog: Through deep concentration.\n* Hatha Yog: Through exertion.\n* Raja Yog: Through meditation.\nSome say Yog was first started by Shiva, while others credit Sage Kapil. Ved Vyas included Yog in the Bhagavad Gita, providing one of the broadest interpretations, where each chapter is described as a different Yog. Sage Patanjali’s *Yog Sutra* is widely recognized as the authoritative work on Yog. It also offers a broad interpretation of Yog, encompassing all aspects of one’s whole life.\nHatha Yog is a narrower interpretation of Yog, focusing on body postures (Asanas), cleansing activities (Kriyas), and breathing exercises (Pranayama). In Yog literature, there are a number of reliable texts on Hatha Yoga, written between the 6th and 15th centuries AD. Four that stand out among them are:\n1. *Hatha Yog Pradeepika* by Yogi Swatmarama\n2. *Goraksha Samhita* by Yogi Gorakhnath\n3. *Gheranda Samhita* by Sage Gheranda\n4. *Hatharatnavali* by Srinivasbhatta Mahayogindra\nYog in the 20th century was revived by Krishnamacharya of Mysore, who was patronized by the King of Mysore about a century ago. His two disciples, B.K.S. Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois, played a key role in spreading Yog throughout the world.\nBroadly, one can say that Hatha Yog, combined with Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana Yog disciplines, as preached in the Gita, prepares one to practice meditation. The triangle of the knower, the knowledge, and the known, once dissolved, is the ultimate state of being. Achieving this state is Yog.\nThe state of samadhi, achieved through yog and meditation, is not experienced by our sense organs, mind, or intellect, and is therefore indescribable in words. But one thing is certain, it must provide a very happy and peaceful experience; otherwise, why would one, after experiencing it, continue to return to it again and again?\nThe knowledge of the supreme self and ultimate reality (Brahman) is necessary but not sufficient to realize it. Experience is essential. The experience cannot be realized until we streamline our body, mind, and intellect through proper disciplines as expounded by Patanjali in his Yog Sutras: Yam, Niyam, Asan, Pranayam, Pratyahar, Dharna, Dhyan and Samadhi. In the Gita, the recommendation is similar but further classified by one’s aptitude (*gunas*) into Karma (action), Bhakti (devotion), and Jnana (knowledge). When a seeker who has achieved this balance in life (defined as *sthitaprajna* in the Gita as a person of steady wisdom) practices concentration (*dharana*), their meditation (*dhyana*) is successful, and they achieve samadhi.\nThe Yogatattva Upanishad declares that the realization of the supreme self is possible for the yog student who is free from \"passion, anger, fear, delusion, greed, pride, lust, miserliness, swoon, giddiness, hunger, thirst, ambition, shame, fright, heart-burning, grief, and gladness.\"\nIt would not be inappropriate to say that following the five pillars of health as expounded in my blogs to-date helps one achieve this goal.\nAnother Perspective on Yog\nYog means to join. What are we trying to join? One way to look at ourselves is to realize that we are a bundle of body, mind and intellect (BMI). With the body, we perceive the world of objects around us; with the mind, we feel the world of emotions around us; and with the intellect, we think in the world of thoughts (ideologies) around us. So we, as the Perceiver, Feeler, Thinker (PFT) equipped with our BMI, are constantly seeking happiness in the world of Objects, Emotions, and Thoughts (OET) around us. Very often, these three pursuits for happiness are in conflict with each other. The body wants to pursue one thing, the mind another, and the intellect has a totally different agenda.\nFor example, it is late at night, and you are watching a great movie on TV that you have been wanting to see for a very long time, but you have an important meeting the next morning at the office. The body is tired and wants to go to sleep, the mind wants to watch the movie, and the intellect is saying, “Don’t be ridiculous; you have an important meeting in the morning.”\nIn our pursuit of happiness, we face such conflicts all the time—conflicts within our own body, mind, and intellect. In our teenage years, we mistakenly confuse physical attraction with love, or in adulthood, fall in love with a neighbor’s wife, knowing very well in our intellect that this is inappropriate and will lead to unhappy endings.\nMost smokers know that smoking is bad but cave into the body’s desire to smoke. The same goes for alcohol drinkers and those addicted to chocolate, cheese, or mithai. Thus, one goal towards happiness is to bring our own Body, Mind, and Intellect into sync so that internal conflicts disappear. THIS IS YOG.\nSeeking Happiness\nWe all seek happiness, but interestingly enough, what we seek is different for each of us. One person seeks cigarettes while another hates cigarettes. As the scotch drinker walks through a duty free shop at an airport terminal, he is attracted to various scotches on display, but his wife has no interest in them and is drawn to the perfume counter where all the finest perfumes are displayed. Why is this so?\nOur sages point out in our scriptures that this is because of our interactions in the earlier years of life. If, as a teenager, trying to belong to a clique of smokers, you cave into smoking, you develop that addiction. If the group you were exposed to consisted of alcohol drinkers, you develop an addiction to alcohol. The same applies to marijuana smokers or cocaine users. The term used to define these in Vedanta is *vasanas*. The way we interact with the world around us develops impressions that lead to such desires. These desires always dictate our actions, and our mind is constantly flooded with thoughts—thoughts about subtle desires that we feel, if fulfilled, will be the source of happiness.\nClearly, the object, emotion, or thought that we are seeking does not carry happiness. If it did, everyone would experience it, but they don’t. Thus, the scriptures tell us that our personality has embedded in it the happiness code. Our true nature is happiness. Pure consciousness in us is blissful. We are unable to experience it because of the cover of *vasanas* that we have accumulated during our lifetime to date. When we act in this world with an egocentric desire, we accumulate more desires. When we act in this world without any egocentric desires, we feel bliss.\nWater drops flow towards water to merge with it. Mercury droplets are in a hurry to merge with other droplets. It is in our nature to seek our true selves. The consciousness in us (jeevatama) is seeking to merge into pure, universal consciousness (Parmatma).\nBringing these together is YOG.\nDoing yogasana is one of eight steps in achieving this. Patanjali called this pursuit Ashtanga Yog - The eight limbs of yog.\nAs we practice Yog, we should keep in mind that we must strive to practice these steps of Yog every day of our life.\n————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————",

lose your edge but meditation can actually slow&nbsp; down the aging process in your brain this comes&nbsp;&nbsp; from a 2015 study from UCLA they found that&nbsp; long-term meditators had healthier brains&nbsp;&nbsp; than non-meditators you know the crazy thing&nbsp; is even the researchers were shocked by their&nbsp;&nbsp; findings they expected a small difference if any&nbsp; in the size of their brains but instead they found&nbsp;&nbsp; significant changes in brain volume by meditating&nbsp; regularly these people developed more gray matter&nbsp;&nbsp; and their brain volume stayed far more consistent&nbsp; in other words meditation held back many of the&nbsp;&nbsp; most detrimental effects of Aging in the brain&nbsp; awarding them a healthier more productive mind for&nbsp;&nbsp; years to come number two structural transformation&nbsp; but meditation doesn't just make your brain bigger&nbsp;&nbsp; it can change the physical shape of your brain&nbsp; too according to a 2011 study from the journal&nbsp;&nbsp; psychiatry research meditation transforms to&nbsp; specific structures in the brain the hippocampus&nbsp;&nbsp; and the amygdala the first the hippocampus is&nbsp; a tiny structure located in your temporal lobe&nbsp;&nbsp; despite its small size your hippocampus plays a&nbsp; major role in critical cognitive functions like&nbsp;&nbsp; memory and learning without your hippocampus&nbsp; you couldn't even remember your own name after&nbsp;&nbsp; eight short weeks of meditation training&nbsp; researchers found that participants had&nbsp;&nbsp; larger thicker hippocampus which means faster&nbsp; learning and a much more efficient memory the&nbsp;&nbsp; second structure the amygdala is the emotional&nbsp; center of your brain known for its almond like&nbsp;&nbsp; shape the amygdala processes fundamental emotions&nbsp; like fear and anxiety but the same 2011 study&nbsp;&nbsp; found that meditation reduces that negativity it&nbsp; shrinks areas in your amygdala related to stress&nbsp;&nbsp; and other damaging emotions you know words by&nbsp; meditating frequently you may actually transform&nbsp;&nbsp; the shape of your brain and change your life for&nbsp; the better number three deactivating your network&nbsp;&nbsp; your brain is full of systems and networks like&nbsp; the default mode network or dmn this large pack&nbsp;&nbsp; of neural structures spans across the majority of&nbsp; your brain and it handles all kinds of cognitive&nbsp;&nbsp; functions from creation of selfhood to episodic&nbsp; memory it even covers theory of mind to put it&nbsp;&nbsp; simply your dmn helps you understand the past&nbsp; the future and the people around you so you&nbsp;&nbsp; couldn't really live without it but your dmn isn't&nbsp; always your friend an overactive network leads to&nbsp;&nbsp; something called mind wandering mind wandering&nbsp; is when your brain gets caught up in a cycle of&nbsp;&nbsp; what-ifs worries and doubts these self referential&nbsp; ideas come directly from your dmn and can really&nbsp;&nbsp; bring you down in fact a 2010 study from the&nbsp; journal Science explains that too much wandering&nbsp;&nbsp; makes people unhappy and unfocused luckily&nbsp; meditation may be the answer a 2011 study from&nbsp;&nbsp; Yale University found that people who meditate&nbsp; have less activity in their DMN why is that well&nbsp;&nbsp; because meditation slows down this neural network&nbsp; it encourages you to live in the moment to focus&nbsp;&nbsp; on the present and spend less time worrying about&nbsp; your past or your future and that can really lift&nbsp;&nbsp; your spirits the same 2011 study found that&nbsp; meditation can significantly improve your mood&nbsp;&nbsp; participants felt happier overall and when their&nbsp; mind started to wander they were much quicker to&nbsp;&nbsp; recover number 4 perception of pain meditation is&nbsp; more than just a mental process if you practice&nbsp;&nbsp; meditation on a regular basis you can reduce both&nbsp; mental and physical pain let's say you took a long&nbsp;&nbsp; hike yesterday and your legs are aching is there&nbsp; anything you can do to minimize that pain well&nbsp;&nbsp; meditation may do the trick this was discovered&nbsp; in 2011 by a study in the Journal of Neuroscience&nbsp;&nbsp; they found that meditation directly impacts pain&nbsp; mechanisms in your brain because pain in many ways&nbsp;&nbsp; is a mental process while injury isn't something&nbsp; you can control your experience of that injury&nbsp;&nbsp; takes place in your brain so if you can control&nbsp; your mental states you may be able to control&nbsp;&nbsp; your pain to number five finding your flow state&nbsp; have you ever been so absorbed in your work you&nbsp;&nbsp; forgot the outside world even existed this state&nbsp; of mind goes by a few different names some call it&nbsp;&nbsp; the zone others say absolute focus but most call&nbsp; this a flow States it's a short period of time&nbsp;&nbsp; when you're 100% focused on one specific thing&nbsp; most people just can't snap in and out of this&nbsp;&nbsp; flow state whenever they want but meditation&nbsp; makes that transition a whole lot easier by&nbsp;&nbsp; practicing mindfulness you can isolate yourself in&nbsp; any environment and you can focus the entirety of&nbsp;&nbsp; your attention on small tasks like breathing&nbsp; regular meditators are amazing at this kind&nbsp;&nbsp; of attentional isolation which can boost their&nbsp; concentration their performance and their time&nbsp;&nbsp; in a state of flow number six unexpected happiness&nbsp; the next major benefit of meditation hits you when&nbsp;&nbsp; you least expect it according to a 2008 study in&nbsp; the annals of behavioral medicine many people who&nbsp;&nbsp; meditate experience a small boost in their mood&nbsp; it's one of the most reliable ways to increase&nbsp;&nbsp; well-being and quality of life ah but here's&nbsp; the part most people don't expect meditation&nbsp;&nbsp; can also help you find happiness in the world&nbsp; around you frequent meditators view people in&nbsp;&nbsp; places in a new light their meditation helps them&nbsp; discover new perspective they find joy in small&nbsp;&nbsp; unexpected events and they learn to appreciate&nbsp; everything that life has to offer number seven&nbsp;&nbsp; social gratitude gratitude comes naturally&nbsp; when you meditate you'll begin discovering&nbsp;&nbsp; value and many of the things you once took for&nbsp; granted especially the people who matter the&nbsp;&nbsp; most in your life meditation provides a newfound&nbsp; appreciation for the connections you've made and&nbsp;&nbsp; the bonds you've built you may even reflect on&nbsp; all the ways your life has been shaped by your&nbsp;&nbsp; relationships for better or for worse as you&nbsp; discover yourself and learn to live in the&nbsp;&nbsp; moment you can truly enjoy the time you spend&nbsp; with your friends and loved ones because the&nbsp;&nbsp; unfortunate truth is many people don't know how&nbsp; you see they're so focused on making new friends&nbsp;&nbsp; they never develop the ones they have so by&nbsp; meditating regularly you can learn to value&nbsp;&nbsp; the people in your life and appreciate the power&nbsp; of real human connection number eights bonding&nbsp;&nbsp; with compassion there's another reason meditation&nbsp; creates these deeper social bonds yeah you can&nbsp;&nbsp; learn to live in the moment and yeah you're more&nbsp; appreciative of the people that love you but you&nbsp;&nbsp; also care more about people in general meditation&nbsp; makes you a more compassionate individual someone&nbsp;&nbsp; who listens empathizes and truly invests in the&nbsp; people you meet in a 2012 study from the clinical&nbsp;&nbsp; psychology review researchers tested whether or&nbsp; not this was actually true does meditation make&nbsp;&nbsp; people more compassionate well to test this they&nbsp; use two different meditation techniques one was&nbsp;&nbsp; called loving-kindness meditation and another&nbsp; called compassion meditation in theory these&nbsp;&nbsp; practices should develop areas in your brain&nbsp; related to kindness and compassion so what did&nbsp;&nbsp; they find researchers found significant increases&nbsp; in those exact parts of the brain resulting in a&nbsp;&nbsp; higher capacity for both compassion and empathy&nbsp; hey that's already impressive but there's more&nbsp;&nbsp; these two techniques gave people more than they&nbsp; bargained for by increasing their capacity for&nbsp;&nbsp; empathy meditation ease their social anxiety and&nbsp; reduced any pent up anger so meditation doesn't&nbsp;&nbsp; just help you bond with others it teaches&nbsp; you to be more compassionate toward yourself&nbsp;&nbsp; number nine accelerated concentration meditation&nbsp; is a great way to tighten your focus a 2013 study&nbsp;&nbsp; published by the Association for psychological&nbsp; science found that mindfulness meditation helps&nbsp;&nbsp; you retain more information it helps you learn&nbsp; faster and stay on task for longer periods of&nbsp;&nbsp; time they tested this hypothesis with two groups&nbsp; of standardized test takers applying either to&nbsp;&nbsp; college or graduate school one group was taught&nbsp; how to meditate and the other wasn't if meditation&nbsp;&nbsp; really does improve focus the first group should&nbsp; out focus and outperform their counterparts hey&nbsp;&nbsp; and that's exactly what happened the meditating&nbsp; test takers were significantly more accurate and&nbsp;&nbsp; they received better overall scores but that's&nbsp; not all these students were also much better&nbsp;&nbsp; at something called concentration correction&nbsp; when they felt themselves getting distracted&nbsp;&nbsp; they quickly caught themselves redirected their&nbsp; attention and got right back to work so what's&nbsp;&nbsp; the secret meditation doesn't actually change&nbsp; the way you concentrate it simply trains your&nbsp;&nbsp; brain to ignore distractions because your&nbsp; brain has this bad habit of jumping from&nbsp;&nbsp; one new stimulus to the next obviously that&nbsp; scatterbrain thinking can really impact your&nbsp;&nbsp; memory and your performance so try meditation&nbsp; to help yourself stay focused when it matters&nbsp;&nbsp; most number 10 lasting confidence few people&nbsp; realize how much meditation can affect your&nbsp;&nbsp; self-confidence this comes from a 1995 study&nbsp; from the General Hospital of Psychiatry they&nbsp;&nbsp; found that meditation has a neutralizing effect&nbsp; on social anxiety as little as fifteen minutes&nbsp;&nbsp; a day can soothe your general nervousness and&nbsp; reduce self-inflicted stress which gives you&nbsp;&nbsp; more confidence in all kinds of nerve-wracking&nbsp; situations but this burst of confidence is not&nbsp;&nbsp; just a one-time thing no meditation can soothe&nbsp; your nerves years after you stopped practicing in&nbsp;&nbsp; that 1995 study participants took an eight-week&nbsp; course on mindfulness meditation and it did&nbsp;&nbsp; decrease their anxiety but those improvements&nbsp; held up over three years later even if they&nbsp;&nbsp; hadn't practiced meditating since their original&nbsp; my point is a short stent of meditation can have&nbsp;&nbsp; lasting effects on your attitude your anxiety and&nbsp; most of all your self-confidence hey thank you&nbsp;&nbsp;

        "content": "THE  UNKNOWN\nThere are things we do not know. There are questions that went unanswered in our childhood, and as we grew up, we stopped asking them—until we have children of our own. When I questioned my parents repeatedly, they likely said, \"It's too late now, go to sleep.\" Honestly, I don’t remember, but that’s what I told my own children.\nWhenever we try to comprehend these mysteries using our faculties—body, mind, and intellect—we often come up empty-handed. Our sages faced the same dilemma, as recorded in the Taittiriya Upanishad:\n“Yato vacho nivartante,\naprapya manasa saha.”\n\"That, from which my mental faculties keep returning, without reaching.\"\nWhen direct inquiry fails, we turn to indirect methods. In mathematics, for instance, we often assign a symbol to the unknown, like \"Let’s assume the unknown is X.\" We then apply logic to solve for X, and once found, we say, “Therefore, X equals...”\nSimilarly, our ancestors represented the unknown with a sound symbol: “Om.” But then, what is Om? Indirect inquiry led to three answers, forming the universal laws of causation:\nLaws of Causation\n1. Every effect must have a cause.\n2. Effects are nothing but the cause itself in different forms.\nFor example, different gold ornaments are simply variations of the gold nugget found in the mine. Similarly, all the pots made by a potter—whether a honey pot or a spittoon—are simply clay in various forms.\n3. When the cause is removed from the effect, nothing remains.\nOur sages likely understood this when they wrote the Isha Upanishad, as the answer appears in its very first verse. The title \"Isha Upanishad\" means \"The Word of God\":\nॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।\nपूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥\n“Poornamadah poornamidam poornaat poornamudachyate,\nPoornasya poornamadaya poornamevaavashishyate.”\n“THAT is Whole, THIS is Whole.\nThis Whole manifests from that Whole, and\nWhen this Whole is removed (negated) from that Whole,\nWhat remains is Whole.”\nThis verse is considered by many to be the most significant in Vedanta. It is said that if there were ever a holocaust (Pralaya) and all Vedantic scriptures were lost except for this verse, future generations could recreate the entire Vedantic body of knowledge through contemplation on this single verse.\n“THAT” refers to the unknown we are seeking to understand—the Supreme Being, by whatever name we choose: Bhagwan, God, Khuda, Vahe Guru, Reality, Truth, or Consciousness. “THIS” refers to the world as we know or experience it—the Cosmos. Logic and set theory teach us that two “Wholes” cannot exist separately; they must be one and the same. “THIS” manifests from “THAT,” exists in “THAT,” and when negated through knowledge and wisdom, what remains is “THAT.”\nAdi Guru Shankaracharya illustrated this concept with the example of a rope and a snake. During a camping trip, if your grandchild runs to you at night, claiming there is a snake beside the tent, you might bring a flashlight only to discover that what appeared to be a snake was merely a rope left there while setting up the tent. The snake manifested from the rope, existed in the rope, and when the darkness of ignorance was dispelled and the snake was negated, what remained was the rope.\nVedantic literature is full of such verses that may seem nonsensical at first but require a teacher to explain. This is why the wisdom portion of the Vedas is called Upanishad—what is to be learned while sitting at the feet of a teacher. Make it a part of your daily life.\nLife of Yogic Masters\nIn all my health groups, discussions often arise about the merits of our rich cultural heritage—yoga, pranayama, and meditation. Given the nutritional richness of Indian spices, one might expect that our yogic and spiritual masters would have lived long and healthy lives. Typically, these discussions emerge in response to my criticism of dairy, ghee, and oil. This led me to research the lives of spiritual and yogic masters over the last 150 years. Among sixteen masters, their life spans ranged from 39 to 100 years, with an average of 78 years and a median of 77.5 years. Even when excluding the two extremes, the average life span of the remaining 14 was 79.2 years\nI was fortunate to be blessed by three of these masters and even cooked many meals for two of them. Here is the raw data:\n1. Mahavatar Babaji: 74\n2. Vivekananda: 39\n3. Shivananda: 76\n4. Ramana Maharshi: 71\n5. Kuvalyananda: 82\n6. T. Krishnamacharya: 100\n7. Paramahansa Yogananda: 59\n8. Anandamayi Ma: 86\n9. Dhirendra Brahmachari: 70\n10. Mahesh Yogi: 90\n11. BKS Iyengar: 96\n12. Pattabhi Jois: 94\n13. TKV Desikachar: 78\n14. Chinmayananda: 77\n15. Swami Rama: 71\n16. Dayanand Saraswati: 85\nThis raises an important question: Why is the lifespan of these yogic masters comparable to that of an average American, who often has an unhealthy diet and lifestyle? Compared to people living in Blue Zones around the world, the life expectancy of yogic masters falls short. People in Blue Zones do not practice yoga, pranayama, or meditation, nor do they include rich spices in their diet. So, why the disconnect? I believe there are two main reasons:\n1. Dietary Misconceptions:\nOur ancestors may have been mistaken about the benefits of milk, yogurt, butter, ghee, and oil. If these yogic masters had excluded dairy and refined oils from their diets, they might have lived an additional 10-20 years.\n2. Meal Timing:\nWe also got it wrong regarding the timing of dinner. It is better to finish meals before sunset or at least before it gets dark. Most spiritual masters had late dinners and long eating windows.\nThe Jains got it right with Chauvihar, but they also erred with dairy. I have visited Veeraytan, Girnar, and Palitana and interacted with many Jain spiritual masters who suffer from high cholesterol and heart disease. The main culprit is dairy.\nI meet many people in India who are on chronic medications, and they tell me they have started practicing yoga, pranayama, and meditation. These are all good practices that I follow and strongly recommend. However, to reverse chronic diseases, you must stop consuming the foods that are causing the disease in the first place.\n————————————-\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————-",

        "content": "OUR NEEDS, WANTS & VALUES\nHumans are always seeking happiness, but what we pursue to achieve it varies from person to person and can change over time. Once we achieve what we seek, the joy is fleeting, and soon we find ourselves chasing the next source of happiness. This cycle has been studied by scholars and extensively explored in the wisdom of Vedanta and the Bhagavad Gita.\nMaslow’s Hierarchy of Needs\nAbraham Maslow, a psychologist from Columbia University, delved into why people do what they do. In his 1943 paper, \"Hierarchy of Needs,\" he explained human motivation through a hierarchy of needs. This concept was influential during my studies at IIT Kanpur and has guided me along with my exploration of Vedanta.\nMaslow emphasized focusing on people's positive qualities rather than viewing them as a \"bag of symptoms.\" His work influenced Martin Seligman, who later developed the field of Positive Psychology.\nMaslow stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a \"bag of symptoms\". This was later picked up by others and notably Martin Seligman in 1999 who became the President of American Psychological Association and developed the field of Positive Psychology.\nMaslow's thesis is simple: human needs can be classified into five hierarchical categories, and as people satisfy lower-level needs, they move up to higher levels:\n1. Physiological Body Needs\nThese are biological necessities for human survival, such as air, water, food, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, and sleep. They are the most critical needs, as other needs become secondary until these are met.\n2. Safety Needs\nOnce physiological needs are satisfied, the need for safety and security becomes prominent. Today, family and societal laws and order fulfill this need for most people.\n3. Love & Belonging Needs\nThese involve emotional needs for relationships, affiliation, and connectedness. Family, friends, and social groups often fulfill this need. When I first arrived in Los Angeles 50 years ago, I desperately sought a familiar face and befriended a Pakistani roommate. Many wealthy Americans find themselves lacking in this area, surrounded by people yet feeling lonely.\n4. Esteem Needs (Ego)\nThis level includes self-worth, accomplishment, and respect. Maslow divided these into esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement) and the desire for reputation or respect from others (status, prestige). This need leads to the pursuit of better jobs, clothing, ornaments, cars, and homes.\n5. Self-Actualization Needs\nThis is the highest level and involves realizing one's potential, seeking personal growth, and experiencing peak moments. It is doing something for its own sake, not to satisfy any lower-level needs.\nIn today’s societies, most educated people can fulfill the three lower-level needs easily and find themselves at the level of “Need for Esteem”.  However, many get stuck there, unable to rise to the Self-Actualization” need. This phase differs slightly from what Vedanta calls “Self-Realization” but serves as a precursor to it. The intoxication of esteem is referred to as Maya Moh, or Maya Jaal in Vedanta. Sometimes a significant event, such as heart attack or a stroke or an accident can awaken us to the reality that we already have everything we need to be happy. During COVID-19, many realized the value of family and a simple life. Some awakening realizations included:\n- Giving up uncomfortable designer clothes that we often wear to impress others.\n- We eat what we enjoy, not expensive restaurant meals to show off.\n- Expensive wines and single malt scotches were never truly our preference; fresh lime water is more pleasing.\n- Imported caviars and cheeses weren’t really our taste; traditional foods like aloo chaat and sarson ka saag were always our favorites.\nWe often do things in others' presence that we wouldn’t do alone, out of a desire to climb a social ladder of false values. When a life jolt, like a loved one’s illness or death or COVID-19, occurs, it opens our eyes to reality. Vedanta echoes this idea, emphasizing that one’s true nature is happiness.\nTat Twam ASI\n“That (what you are searching for) You Are”\nModern thinkers, through their research, reach similar realizations.\nRethinking Values: Is Time Really Money?\nThe belief that \"time is money\" is widespread, but is it true? The COVID-19 crisis prompted us to question many societal norms. Harvard psychologist Ashley Whillans explored the relationship between time and money. After surveying people across economic backgrounds, she concluded:\n“Nothing less than our health and happiness depends on reversing the innate notion that time is money.”\nWhillans, who teaches negotiation at Harvard Business School, focuses on the trade-offs between time and money. She notes:\n“Focusing on chasing wealth is a trap, because it leads only to an increased focus on chasing wealth.”\nMost people focus too much on work and earning money, neglecting time for themselves. Shifting the mindset to prioritize time over money offers benefits. Her research shows that once basic needs and future savings are covered, additional wealth adds little to happiness. In her words:\n“Unsurprisingly, most people focus too much on working and and making money and not enough on having more time. But shifting your mindset to prioritize time over money can have several benefits.”\nHer research shows that after earning enough to cover basic needs and future savings, additional wealth does little for happiness. In her words:\n“Once people start making a lot of money, they begin to think they're doing worse in life, because they become obsessed with comparing themselves to those who are richer. Even multimillionaires make the mistake of believing that money, and not time, will enrich their lives.”\nA survey of the world’s wealthiest found 75% (many with net worth over $10 million) felt that they needed \"a lot more\" money to be happy. This mindset is misguided. Parts of our brain are programmed to choose vice over virtue, leading to unhealthy choices. Many in my health groups struggle to get over addictions acquired in their past pursuit of false values.\nIn adversity, there is opportunity. Let's use these realizations to reach Maslow’s fifth level and focus on what we truly enjoy, not how we are perceived.\nWorld Happiness Report\nIn 2011, the UN unanimously adopted a resolution promoting sustainable happiness and well-being. This initiative, introduced by Bhutan and supported by 68 member states, led to the annual World Happiness Report, first published in 2012. The 11th report, released in 2023, again highlighted Scandinavian countries at the top.\nOne conclusion from these reports is that the happiness of Scandinavian countries relates more to human relationships and work-life balance than financial wealth. Social security for healthcare and old age can surpass economic gains in contributing to happiness. Pressuring children for economic success may shortchange them from life's success.\nMany of us focus on amassing large savings out of fear of unexpected medical emergencies in old age, neglecting health and wellness, often leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. Adopting PBWF/IF/10K lifestyle changes can improve health, boosting confidence in personal health management and significantly impacting happiness. The fifth pillar of health not only improves physical health but fosters happiness regardless of physical condition.\n———————————\nEND OF BLOG\n———————————",

        "content": "•••• 2 Most Frequently Asked Questions ••••\nI will be opening the group for Q&A now. But before I do that I want you to understand that many of the most frequently asked questions are flawed to begin with. Here are two examples.\n1. “What should my diet be to prevent diabetes, stroke, heart attack, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, etc.?”\nThe problem with this question is that it assumes a different diet is needed to prevent each disease. If that were true, how would we choose which disease to prevent and which one to ignore? This logic simply doesn’t hold.\nA truly healthy diet should benefit all chronic diseases. The PBWF/IF/10K diet and lifestyle I recommend does exactly that — it helps prevent and even reverse most chronic conditions.\nOf course, for individuals with advanced disease, organ failure, or artificial implants, medical advice specific to their condition is necessary. That said, most elements of the diet are benign and generally safe. One notable exception is for those with advanced kidney disease, where some green leafy vegetables high in oxalates may need to be restricted.\n2. “I have this symptom, and that one… what should my diet be?”\nHere again, the same principle applies.\nNutrient deficiencies (or excesses) show up as symptoms, but those symptoms vary widely from person to person. While our genetics are quite similar, epigenetically we are all unique — so the symptoms of same deficiency might look completely different in different individuals.\nWhat makes matters more complicated is that we usually don’t suffer from just one deficiency. When multiple deficiencies (or toxic excesses) are involved, the number of symptom combinations becomes enormous — possibly thousands or even millions. Expecting a doctor to diagnose these just by listening to your symptoms is unrealistic.\nThis is why treatment, whether conventional or alternative, often feels like trial and error. Another issue is reporting bias — people who don’t benefit from a treatment usually stay silent, but those who experience improvement tell everyone. For instance, someone might say, “I had this issue for 10 years, saw 10 doctors, and nothing worked. But this homeopath/Ayurvedic/alternative doctor cured me.” Excited, they share their experience with 10 others. The 9 others who didn’t benefit say nothing — but the one who did spreads the word widely, creating a false impression of a miracle cure.\nThe strength of the PBWF/IF/10K approach is that it naturally eliminates both deficiencies and excesses (which can also be toxic), allowing the body to heal. That’s why I recommend starting with a 3–5 day green juice fast. It offers deep detoxification and high-density nutrition — a powerful foundation for recovery.\nMost problems we experience are systemic in nature and are result of many years of consuming unhealthy food and living an unhealthy lifestyle. It is not a good idea to correct the symptoms (high blood pressure or high blood sugar or high LDL cholesterol etcetera), even if you could, without addressing the root cause of them. Correcting symptoms with some concoction (Nani ka Nuskha) or herb is not a good idea. At least you are now conscious of the problem and willing to do something about it. If the symptoms are lowered without correcting the root cause, you will develop a false sense of relief. Your body will keep getting sicker and sicker and come back with bigger problems like heart attack or stroke. Killing messengers is never a good idea.\nWhen you follow the 12 point guidelines the root causes of lifestyle diseases get addressed and your body heals. And when the body heals, everything heals.\nI am posting below the 12 point guidelines again in a summarized table. Please print it and post it on your refrigerator or desk. I get asked many times to repeat it.",

        "content": "•••   DAIRY MYTH   •••\nA long-standing, prevalent belief champions dairy as the perfect food. While it may indeed be ideal for calves it is not the case for humans. The perfect food for humans is human milk, and that too only during infancy. Humans are unique in two respects: (1) they continue milk consumption beyond infancy and (2) they consume the milk of another species. The origins of this practice are murky but it may have begun thousands of years ago during a famine. In desperate times consumption of cow’s milk, which led to survival, may have sparked the widespread domestication of cows.\nThis topic presents a personal conflict for me. Numerous doctors in the Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement advise against dairy, supported by a plethora of studies. However Ayurveda, an ancient Indian wisdom, endorses it, albeit sparingly. Most PBWF recommendations align with Ayurveda except for dairy products like milk and ghee.\nAll mammals nurse their young with milk specifically formulated for their offspring's growth rate. For instance, a calf grows tenfold in six months, necessitating a milk composition rich in proteins, fats, and growth hormones like IGF-1. These components, while beneficial for calves, can potentially fuel cancer cell growth in humans without affecting normal cells, akin to how fertilizers promote lawn growth but also enable weeds to flourish unchecked.\nINDIAN STUDY ON DAIRY PROTEIN\nA groundbreaking study in 1967 by Dr. Gopalan and Madhvan at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad (India) examined the effects of dietary protein levels on cancer development. Mice, injected with a carcinogen and fed diets of varying protein levels, showed a direct correlation between high dairy protein intake and cancer growth. This study, which initially perplexed many, including Dr. Colin Campbell, laid the groundwork for a significant shift in understanding the relationship between animal protein and cancer.\nDr. Campbell's subsequent research, including the comprehensive China Study, underscored the detrimental effects of animal proteins, particularly from dairy, on our health. These findings advocate for minimizing dairy and animal protein consumption in diets exceeding 8% total protein, especially in affluent societies with abundant food choices.\nIt's important to recognize that dairy products do not cause cancer - they only contribute to its progression. The initiation of cancer is primarily due to gene mutations, which can result from a variety of factors such as radiation and toxic chemicals present in our environment. This suggests that cancer-causing agents were less prevalent in ancient times.\nIn scenarios of food scarcity, dairy protein can be considered a viable nutritional option. Historically milk likely played a crucial role during times of famine, potentially saving many communities from extinction. It is also worth noting that gene mutations caused by toxic chemicals and radiation were presumably less common in the past due to the limited presence of these harmful agents.\nIn 1967, the per capita milk consumption in India was 107 ml per person- today it has quadrupled to 427 ml per person. This increase occurred despite widespread knowledge of milk's potential role in promoting health issues, including cancer. While the Government of India recognized Dr. Gopalan's contributions with the Padma Bhushan award, his advice on this matter was not heeded.\nWhy Milk Today is Harmful Compared to The Past\nToday's dairy products differ significantly from those our ancestors consumed and we face different health challenges. Factors contributing to the harm caused by modern dairy include industrial farming practices, the genetic composition of dairy cows and the increased presence of environmental carcinogens. Additionally, lifestyle changes and increased life expectancy call for a reevaluation of dairy's role in our diet. Here are some examples:\n* Dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination.\n* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.\n* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield.\n* They are injected with high-dose antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions.\nAll these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk cows produce and are very harmful to human health.\nLife expectancy in the olden days was low and an age of 70-80 was considered a life long lived. Very few lived beyond that. Today we are talking about increasing human life expectancy to 100+ years like in Blue Zones.\nI have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Michael Gregor. They all are against consuming dairy products. Dr. Collin Campbell did concede that if the total protein in a diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay to consume as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows.\nWhy Dairy Is Unhealthy?\nNumerous studies and expert opinions highlight dairy's potential health risks including its ineffectiveness in bone health, its link to cancer, and its contribution to various diseases and conditions. Widespread lactose intolerance further underscores dairy's unsuitability for many. Here are some specific examples:\n(1) There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries in Africa which have the lowest rate of milk consumption also have the lowest rate of osteoporosis. Conversely, countries consuming the most milk have the  highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers.\n(2) Dairy consumption increases the body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks.\n(3) According to a 2006 study by Harvard researchers, conducted with 10,000 women aged 26-46, the women who consumed the most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy product consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer.\n(4) Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body.\n(5) Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body.\n(6) Milk and cheese can cause acne.\n(7) Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases.\n(8) Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome.\n(9) Dairy is a cause of autoimmune diseases like arthritis.\n(10) Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant.\n(11) Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes.\n(12) Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation.\n(13) Other problems associated with dairy include allergies and sinus issues.\n(14) Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet.\nCalcium Myth\nContrary to popular belief, the calcium in dairy is not efficiently absorbed due to its unfavorable phosphorus to calcium ratio. In order to absorb calcium one needs a calcium product that is conducive to absorption. The presence of phosphorus binds calcium to make calcium phosphate and biphosphate and diphosphate and makes it unavailable for absorption. To absorb calcium it must be available without phosphorus and milk does not provide that. So, for the most part, the calcium in the milk is in nonabsorbable. This is the reason why milk does not help people with osteoporosis. It even hurts them.\nGiving calcium pills as supplement also doesn’t help people with osteoporosis. Calcium just goes through the body and is excreted. Even vitamin D supplementation does not help.\nOne has to do something to the bones to get calcium inside the bones. All the trials of supplementing calcium with vitamin D have failed.\nDr. Lustig of UCSF recommends giving calcium to phosphorus in ratio of 4:1 whereas in milk it is 1:2.\nTo achieve satisfactory calcium absorption other forms of calcium are required like calcium chloride or citrate.\nHere are some additional comments that support PBWF doctors' view against dairy.\n* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and even headaches after giving up dairy.\n* Dr. Neil Bernard filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order.\n* The US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in its dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health was one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and had called them “utterly ridiculous”.\n* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia.\nConclusion\nDespite its historical role in human nutrition, the evidence against dairy consumption's health benefits is compelling. Alternatives to dairy, including plant-based milks and yogurts, offer nutritious and safe options for those seeking to avoid dairy's pitfalls. Acknowledging both the scientific findings and the cultural practices surrounding dairy consumption can guide us towards healthier dietary choices.

        "content": "(upbeat music) - Hey munchies, I'm Alyssia if you're new. Welcome! I use milk in a lot of recipes, but it's almost never dairy milk. Actually, I can't even remember the last time I used dairy milk. But you can sub out most any kind of non-dairy milk for most recipes, depending on what you've got for the flavor. Today I'm showing you how to make your own non-dairy milk seven ways, and I've got a free e-book for you to top it off, with three additional ways. Stay tuned. We'll get started with the most basic: a nut milk. I'm making cashew milk because it's my personal favorite, but you can use any nut that your prefer. Almond for a classic almond milk, or even hazelnut, pecan, or walnut. For most of these recipes, the procedure is similar. Start with your raw ingredient, add water, and soak overnight. Drain the water and add the nuts to a blender, along with some additional filtered water. I love my food processor, but I do find that a blender is easier and less messy to work with for homemade milks. Let that go for a good few minutes until it's milky and smooth. Then we're gonna use a handy dandy nut milk bag to strain the mixture. You can get these on Amazon pretty cheap. I'll link some in the description, but there are tons of types, and you can also use a kitchen towel or a few layers of cheese cloth if you don't have or don't wanna get a nut milk bag. I'm making a bunch of milks today, so I invested. (chill electronic music) Use your hands to get as much liquid out as possible, really squeeze it out, and what will be left in the bag is your pulp, cashew pulp in this case, which you can totally save for adding to smoothies, or you can dry it out and use it as a nut flour for baking. No need to waste, which is pretty cool. Transfer the milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will last three to four days in the fridge. These milks will separate after some time since there's no carrageenan, and they're all natural, but just give them A quick shake to reintegrate and you're good to go. Cashew milk tastes similar to almond milk, but is perhaps a little less nutty and creamier. Okay, so that is the oh so basic nut milk. Shall we get on to the rest? And guess what: none of them are nuts. That's nuts! Let's do coconut milk next, which really only needs plain, unsweetened coconut shreds. I wanted to show you guys that you can also add in fun flavors to your non-dairy milks, so I'm going to make this on a strawberry coconut milk, but you could leave it plain or swap out and of these flavor ideas I'm showing with any of the milks, and the instructions for how to do that specifically are in that free e-book you're gonna get. Don't worry about taking notes. Soak the shreds in water for a few hours. It doesn't need to be overnight. Add that mixture to a blender with strawberries and blend for a good few minutes. So in case you're confused, in your wanted plain coconut milk, you would just not include the strawberries. Nothing else needs to change. Strain that mixture through your nut milk bag or tool of choice and voila! A naturally sweet and decadent coconut milk. Now, strawberry coconut milk is mostly good for drinking, or you could use it for smoothies, oatmeal, overnight oats, et cetera, but plain coconut milk is also great for curries, soups, and cooking. Homemade coconut milk is not great for frozen treats because it doesn't have enough fat solids. Okay, next up is rice milk: cinnamon flavor. You can make rice milk with cooked or uncooked rice, and you can use white or brown. I actually like the flavor of uncooked and prefer white, so I am soaking uncooked long-grain white rice in water overnight. Drain it, add additional water to a blender with some cinnamon for flavor, maybe even a pinch of salt, and let it rip. Continue on accordingly. (bright music) Rice milk actually has a pretty mild taste. It's light and a little bit sweet naturally, which pairs really nicely with that cinnamon. This is almost like something I've had before. Horchata, anyone? (bright music) Thumbs up if you are enjoying these non-dairy milk recipes, please! Matcha oat milk. Oat milk is one of my favorite types of milks, and it's becoming more and more popular. The main ingredient: oats, of course! I prefer to not soak oats and just add water at the time of, but some people do like to soak them. I also use rolled oats, but some people make this with steel-cut oats. Then you can just add high quality matcha powder. It should be bright green, not dull, or else it will taste bitter, and then blend and strain. (upbeat electronic music) As plain oat milk, this does have sort of a strong oat flavor, which I like, but it will depend how you wanna use it if your should consider using oat milk as an option. Either way, oat milk is full-bodied, flavorful, and so versatile. Blueberry hemp milk. This one doesn't require soaking, which is nice. It's made from hemp seeds, which means you're getting antiinflammatory effects of the omega-3s, as well as protein. Blend together raw hemp seeds, water, and blueberries, if you want the flavor, until milky. (upbeat music) Strain and serve. Hemp milk has a nutty flavor. For all of these milks, so you know, the amount of water can totally be adjusted if you want a thicker or a more prominent texture, or a thinner and less noticeable texture. Hemp milk is one of the more naturally thin non-dairy milks, so it isn't ideal for adding to your coffee. It's better for just drinking or cereal, oatmeal, et cetera, especially with those blueberries. Vanilla soy milk. When it comes to making soy milk, the most important factor is your beans. Use good quality, mature soy beans, which are going to be white. I got these on Amazon, and we'll link them. Soak the beans overnight with water. Notice how much the absorb the water and really plump up in size. Drain and then add additional filtered water and blend until milky. Soy milk is the one milk that you need to heat to help the flavor. (bright music) Add the mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly. The longer you cook, the less bitter and sweeter it will become. Skim the foam topping, allow it to cool, and then you can remove the skin that forms on top. (bright music) Add the cooled mixture with vanilla extract to your nut milk bag, strain, and enjoy. If you wanted a fruit flavored soy milk, like berry flavored, you'd wanna blend the berries with the cooled, strained soy milk, and then strain once more. Voila! I am not gonna lie, I have a soy milk weakness. It's so tasty, even unsweetened and plain, because it has a natural sweetness that is so satisfying. Don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell for more recipe videos, educational content, and free e-books. The last one I'm sharing today here is a sweet sesame milk. (chill music) Soak raw sesame seeds for a few hours and then blend with water and dates. You know the drill. (chill music) Dates are a great way to add natural sweetness to any of these milks when you make them plain too, but paired with the sesame flavor, oh man. Something about sesame and dates just reminds me of caramel. I love it. (chill music) Okay, so there were seven different non-dairy milks, but I also have three more: a mango quinoa milk, a chocolate chia milk, and a golden banana milk in that free e-book that you can get by clicking the link in my description. FYI, you can also do blends of these milks, like a macadamia hemp or a coconut cashew, for instance, and I've included a few recipes with those types of mix and match ideas in the e-book as well, but I do encourage you to get creative and make your own combos too. You saw how easy it was, and it's so nice to know that I can make all of these at home without any added ingredients that just aren't necessary, and they'll be more affordable than buying the cleaner options at the store. I hope you enjoyed these recipes. Let me know your favorite non-dairy milk in the comments below. If you found this episode fun, or helpful, or learned something, would you share it with someone you know? I appreciate you, and I will see you next week right here. Remember, it's all a matter of mind over munch.",

Such a study has one control group, Such a study has one control group, Such a study has one control group, that's no chemical, then two or three that's no chemical, then two or three that's no chemical, then two or three treatment groups, each with increasing treatment groups, each with increasing treatment groups, each with increasing amounts of chemical, usually far above amounts of chemical, usually far above amounts of chemical, usually far above the amount we humans might experience, the amount we humans might experience, the amount we humans might experience, in order to be sure that it does not in order to be sure that it does not in order to be sure that it does not cause cancer. Take a look at the cause cancer. Take a look at the cause cancer. Take a look at the graph. A cancer-causing response shown graph. A cancer-causing response shown graph. A cancer-causing response shown here as dependent on level of chemical here as dependent on level of chemical here as dependent on level of chemical consumed is then used to estimate which consumed is then used to estimate which consumed is then used to estimate which levels of carcinogen exposure might be levels of carcinogen exposure might be levels of carcinogen exposure might be of concern for humans shown the small of concern for humans shown the small of concern for humans shown the small green box on the lower green box on the lower green box on the lower left. But estimating likely human left. But estimating likely human left. But estimating likely human response is virtually impossible because response is virtually impossible because response is virtually impossible because the rat carcinogen levels are usually the rat carcinogen levels are usually the rat carcinogen levels are usually orders of magnitude higher than typical orders of magnitude higher than typical orders of magnitude higher than typical human human human experience. In our experiments over 25 experience. In our experiments over 25 experience. In our experiments over 25 plus years and published plus years and published plus years and published extensively, we showed that casing extensively, we showed that casing extensively, we showed that casing increased experimental cancer at levels increased experimental cancer at levels increased experimental cancer at levels within the range of human experience. within the range of human experience. within the range of human experience. That is the green box. There was no need That is the green box. There was no need That is the green box. There was no need to estimate low-level response in humans to estimate low-level response in humans to estimate low-level response in humans from high level response in rats. And we from high level response in rats. And we from high level response in rats. And we also know how it works. also know how it works. also know how it works. This suggests that casing and likely This suggests that casing and likely This suggests that casing and likely most other animal proteins is a far more most other animal proteins is a far more most other animal proteins is a far more relevant carcinogen than any pesticide, relevant carcinogen than any pesticide, relevant carcinogen than any pesticide, herbicide, food additive, or other herbicide, food additive, or other herbicide, food additive, or other noxious chemical ever tested.

This suggests a partial explanation for the suggests a partial explanation for the suggests a partial explanation for the longstanding enigma that hip fracture longstanding enigma that hip fracture longstanding enigma that hip fracture rates are highest in populations with rates are highest in populations with rates are highest in populations with the greatest milk the greatest milk the greatest milk consumption. Maybe an explanation why consumption. Maybe an explanation why consumption.

This enigma irked a Swedish research This enigma irked a Swedish research This enigma irked a Swedish research team puzzled because studies again and team puzzled because studies again and team puzzled because studies again and again had shown a tendency of higher again had shown a tendency of higher again had shown a tendency of higher risk of fracture with a higher intake of risk of fracture with a higher intake of risk of fracture with a higher intake of milk. Well, there is a rare birth effect milk. Well, there is a rare birth effect milk. Well, there is a rare birth effect called galactomia where babies are born called galactomia where babies are born called galactomia where babies are born without the enzymes needed to detoxify without the enzymes needed to detoxify without the enzymes needed to detoxify the galactose found in milk. So, they the galactose found in milk. So, they the galactose found in milk. So, they end up with elevated levels of galactose end up with elevated levels of galactose end up with elevated levels of galactose in their blood which can cause bone loss in their blood which can cause bone loss in their blood which can cause bone loss even as kids. So maybe the Swedish even as kids. So maybe the Swedish even as kids. So maybe the Swedish researchers figured even in normal researchers figured even in normal researchers figured even in normal people that can detoxify the stuff, it people that can detoxify the stuff, it people that can detoxify the stuff, it might not be good for the bones to be might not be good for the bones to be might not be good for the bones to be drinking it every day.

Milk-drinking women had the high had Milk-drinking women had the high had Milk-drinking women had the high had higher rates of death, more heart higher rates of death, more heart higher rates of death, more heart disease, significantly more cancer for disease, significantly more cancer for disease, significantly more cancer for each glass of milk. Three glasses a day each glass of milk. Three glasses a day each glass of milk. Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the was associated with nearly twice the was associated with nearly twice the risk of death, and they had risk of death, and they had risk of death, and they had significantly more bone and hip significantly more bone and hip significantly more bone and hip fractures, too. Men in a separate study fractures, too. Men in a separate study fractures, too. Men in a separate study also had a higher rate of death with also had a higher rate of death with also had a higher rate of death with higher milk consumption, but at least higher milk consumption, but at least higher milk consumption, but at least they didn't have higher fracture rates. they didn't have higher fracture rates. they didn't have higher fracture rates. So a dose dependent higher rate of both So a dose dependent higher rate of both So a dose dependent higher rate of both mortality and fracture in women and a mortality and fracture in women and a mortality and fracture in women and a higher rate of mortality in men with higher rate of mortality in men with higher rate of mortality in men with milk intake.

mitochondri Andria to keep the fat and your metabolism slows down to and your metabolism slows down to and your metabolism slows down to preserve this fat richness that just preserve this fat richness that just preserve this fat richness that just came in and that's the opposite of what came in and that's the opposite of what came in and that's the opposite of what you want you say wait a minute I just you want you say wait a minute I just you want you say wait a minute I just ate too much why are you storing it you ate too much why are you storing it you ate too much why are you storing it you got to get rid of it the body was got to get rid of it the body was got to get rid of it the body was programmed a long time ago when there programmed a long time ago when there programmed a long time ago when there were such things as famines so if you were such things as famines so if you were such things as famines so if you ate a big fatty thing your body says ate a big fatty thing your body says ate a big fatty thing your body says I'll keep that and as the years go by I'll keep that and as the years go by I'll keep that and as the years go by people's the the metabolism you had when people's the the metabolism you had when people's the the metabolism you had when you were 12 is just no longer there you were 12 is just no longer there you were 12 is just no longer there because the mitochondria have been because the mitochondria have been because the mitochondria have been Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan diet time goes in the opposite direction diet time goes in the opposite direction diet time goes in the opposite direction okay number four cheese does not have okay number four cheese

fiber is big in this lecture I apologize fiber is big in this lecture I apologize fiber is big stuff though fiber is plant roughage it stuff though fiber is plant roughage it stuff though fiber is plant roughage it has effectively no calories and so when has effectively no calories and so when has effectively no calories and so when I eat high-fiber foods it fills you up I eat high-fiber foods it fills you up I eat high-fiber foods it fills you up makes you think you've eaten a lot of makes you think you've eaten a lot of makes you think you've eaten a lot of foods but but the fact is you haven't foods but but the fact is you haven't foods but but the fact is you haven't really eaten very much so fiber tricks really eaten very much so fiber tricks really eaten very much so fiber tricks the brain into thinking you ate a huge the brain into thinking you ate a huge the brain into thinking you ate a huge amount of food but amount of food but amount of food but Vita has no it's not a

okay so why is cheese fattening survey okay so why is cheese fattening survey okay so why is cheese fattening it's high in calories the fat adds to it's high in calories the fat adds to it's high in calories the fat adds to your body fat it slows down your your body fat it slows down your your body fat it slows down your metabolism day by day it doesn't have metabolism day by day it doesn't have metabolism day by day it doesn't have any fiber at all to control your any fiber at all to control your any fiber at all to control your appetite and it adds a little extra it appetite and it adds a

and Bloated okay now you've heard about the Adventist Health study heard about the Adventist Health study heard about the Adventist Health study researchers have studied Seventh Day researchers have studied Seventh Day researchers have studied Seventh Day Adventist for years because Church Adventist for years because Church Adventist for years because Church teachings say don't smoke don't drink teachings say don't smoke don't drink teachings say don't smoke don't drink avoid caffeine don't eat meat avoid caffeine don't eat meat avoid caffeine don't eat meat and almost all Adventists are very good and almost all Adventists are very good and almost all Adventists are very good at the first at the first at the first three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking healthc conscious people but some eat healthc conscious people but some eat healthc conscious people but some eat meat and some do not and that sets up a meat and some do not and that sets up a meat and some do not and that sets up a perfect natural experiment that perfect natural experiment that perfect natural experiment that researchers can take advantage of so the researchers can take advantage of so the researchers can take advantage of so the Adventist Health study too brought in Adventist Health study too brought in Adventist Health study too brought in not quite 61,000 people and they were not quite 61,000 people and they were not quite 61,000 people and they were all over 30 and they split them into all over 30 and they split them into all over 30 and they split them into five groups based on the diets that they five groups based on the diets that they five groups based on the diets that they normally followed normally followed normally followed and they looked at everyone's body mass and they looked at everyone's body mass and they looked at everyone's body mass IND are body mass index are you familiar IND are body mass index are you familiar IND are body mass index are you familiar with that with that with that BMI it's it's just your weight based on BMI it's it's just your weight based on BMI it's it's just your weight based on but adjusted for how tall you are and so but adjusted for how tall you are and so but adjusted for how tall you are and so a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on the left the Red Band there those are the left the Red Band there those are the left the Red Band there those are nonvegetarians or or basically meat nonvegetarians or or basically meat nonvegetarians or or basically meat eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it was was was 28.8 and the next group were people 28.8 and the next group were people 28.8 and the next group were people called semian Arians meaning they ate called semian Arians meaning they ate called semian Arians meaning they ate meat but only once a week or meat but only once a week or meat but only once a week or less little bit Slimmer the third group less little bit Slimmer the third group less little bit Slimmer the third group The Pesco vegetarians Pesco The Pesco vegetarians Pesco The Pesco vegetarians Pesco meaning okay all right fish they're not meaning okay all right fish they're not meaning okay all right fish they're not eating any meat except for fish they're eating any meat except for fish they're eating any meat except for fish they're a little

vegetarians a little bit Slimmer too and then that fifth group I always have and then that fifth group I always have and then that fifth group I always have to tell my patients that a vegan is not to tell my patients that a vegan is not to tell my patients that a vegan is not a person from the planet Vegas um but a person from the planet Vegas um but a person from the planet Vegas um but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they're actually the only group smack in they're actually the only group smack in they're actually the only group smack in the middle of the healthy weight range the middle of the healthy weight range the middle of the healthy weight range and so now let's compare the lacto oo and so now let's compare the lacto oo and so now let's compare the lacto oo vegetarians and the vegetarians and the vegetarians and the vegans um I am going to argue that vegans um I am going to argue that vegans um I am going to argue that cheese is one of the biggest cheese is one of the biggest cheese is one of the biggest contributors to the extra weight that we contributors to the extra weight that we contributors to the extra weight that we see with the lacto OS and that see with the lacto OS and that see with the lacto OS and that difference is roughly 15 difference is roughly 15 difference is roughly 15 pounds make sense okay so what the heck pounds make sense okay so what the heck pounds make sense okay so what the heck is cheese well you start with milk this is cheese well you start with

in in Teresa Wisconsin the milk comes in in Teresa Wisconsin the milk comes in in the morning and they pour it in this big the morning and they pour it in this big the morning and they pour it in this big tub and then they add some tub and then they add some tub and then they add some bacteria and that gives it that kind of bacteria and that gives it that kind of bacteria and that gives it that kind of funky smell um because it's fermenting funky smell um because it's fermenting funky smell um because it's fermenting the sugars that are in the milk the the sugars that are in the milk the the sugars that are in the milk the lactose sugar then they add renit and lactose sugar then they add renit and lactose sugar then they add renit and you know about renit this is the enzyme you know about

a plant-based diet you why don't you try a plant-based diet here here's the science of here here's the science of here here's the science of it a cow does not give milk unless the it a cow does not give milk unless the it a cow does not give milk unless the cow has been pregnant and like all cow has been pregnant and like all cow has been pregnant and like all mammals they they're they're pregnant mammals they they're they're pregnant mammals they they're they're pregnant they give birth and they and the milk they give birth and they and the milk they give birth and they and the milk comes out okay so as the pregnancy comes out okay so as the pregnancy comes out okay so as the pregnancy proceeds hormones are produced in the proceeds hormones are produced in the proceeds hormones are produced in the the body of the cow and you can measure the body of the cow and you can measure the body of the cow and you can measure them in the blood plasma they it goes up them in the blood plasma they it goes up them in the blood plasma they it goes up and these hormones end up in the milk and these hormones end up in the milk and these hormones end up in the milk there they go and most of the milk that there they go and most of the milk that there they go and most of the milk that anybody ever drinks or that is on the anybody ever drinks or that is on the anybody ever drinks or that is on the shelves of any grocery store in America shelves of any grocery store in America shelves of any grocery store in America most of it comes from pregnant most of it comes from pregnant most of it comes from pregnant cows because they're pregnant cows because they're pregnant cows because they're pregnant impregnated annually they're kept impregnated annually they're kept impregnated annually they're kept pregnant and they have a lot of estrogen pregnant and they have a lot of estrogen pregnant and they have a lot of estrogen in them um that's a match for your in them um that's a

don't know this affect a woman well I don't know this affect a woman well I don't know but researchers have looked into this but researchers have looked into this but researchers have looked into this and what they found is interesting uh and what they found is interesting uh and what they found is interesting uh some Australian researchers in 2010 some Australian researchers in 2010 some Australian researchers in 2010 brought in a group of women who were brought in a group of women who were brought in a group of women who were postmenopausal postmenopausal postmenopausal meaning shouldn't be having a lot of meaning shouldn't be having a lot of meaning shouldn't be having a lot of estrogen in your blood no matter what estrogen in your blood no matter what estrogen in your blood no matter what and they put them into four groups and they put them into four groups and they put them into four groups depending on how much Dairy they ate and depending on how much Dairy they ate and depending on how much Dairy they ate and the group on the left was the people who the group on the left was the people who the group on the left was the people who were the dairy were the dairy were the dairy avoiders and the other three bars are avoiders and the other three bars are avoiders and the other three bars are the people who have had had Dairy as a the people who have had had Dairy as a the people who have had had Dairy as a regular part of their life and what regular part of their life and what regular part of their life and what seems to really make the difference is seems to really make the difference is seems to really make the difference is do you have it or do you not have it do you have it or do you not have it do you have it or do you not have it once people are having a substantial once people are having a substantial once people are having a substantial amount they tend to have a lot of estrad amount they tend to have a lot of estrad amount they tend to have a lot of estrad in their in their in their blood men don't go to sleep researchers blood men don't go to sleep researchers blood men don't go to sleep researchers at Rochester New York went into a at Rochester New York went into a at Rochester New York went into a fertility clinic and they interviewed fertility clinic and they interviewed fertility clinic and they interviewed men and said are you a low cheese eater men and said are you a low cheese eater men and said are you a low cheese eater half a serving a day no more than that half a serving a day no more than that half a serving a day no more than that or are you a big cheese eater like a or are you a big cheese eater like a or are you a big cheese eater like a serving two and a half servings a day serving two and a half servings a day serving two and a half servings a day and they looked at their sperm counts and they looked at their sperm counts and they looked at their sperm counts and the people who tended to avoid and the people who tended to avoid and the people who tended to avoid cheese had better sperm counts the cheese had better sperm counts the cheese had better sperm counts the people who were Big Cheese folks had people who were Big Cheese folks had people who were Big Cheese folks had pretty low sperm counts now is that pretty low sperm counts now is that pretty low sperm counts now is that because there are female hormones from because there are female hormones from because there are female hormones from the milk because the cows are pregnant the milk because the cows are pregnant the milk because the cows are pregnant and so you're getting estrad with every and so you're getting estrad with every and so you're getting estrad with every glass of milk I don't know but Catherine glass of milk I don't know but Catherine glass of milk I don't know but Catherine said let me give this a said let me give this a said let me give this a try she went totally vegan and she went try

um this is Chad let's talk about asthma um this is Chad let's talk about asthma um this is Chad from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived right on the water with his brother and right on the water with his brother and right on the water with his brother and his family and Chad was a very active his family and Chad was a very active his family and Chad was a very active kid he loved sports but he could not get kid he loved sports but he could not get kid he loved sports but he could not get through a baseball game because asthma through a baseball game because asthma through a baseball game because asthma would kick in after the exercise or all would kick in after the exercise or all would kick in after the exercise or all the pollen that he was uh breathing in the pollen that he was uh breathing in the pollen that he was uh breathing in and he had every kind of allergy he was and he had every kind of

somebody when he was about 18 said hey could it be dairy hey could it be dairy hey could it be dairy products why don't you why don't you get products why don't you why don't you get products why don't you why don't you get away from dairy and just away from dairy and just away from dairy and just see and he did he tried it and within see and he did he tried it and within see and he did he tried it and within about 3 months not only was his asthma about 3 months not only was his asthma about 3 months not only was his asthma completely gone but so were his completely gone but so were his completely gone but so were his allergies and what's this about somehow allergies and what's this about somehow allergies and what's this about somehow get avoiding these antigens from dairy get avoiding these antigens from dairy get avoiding these antigens from dairy made his body react in a different way made his body react in a different way made his body react in a different way so scientists have looked into this so scientists have looked into this so scientists have looked into this question could dairy products actually question could dairy products actually question could dairy products actually contribute to asthma and if you go on contribute to asthma and if you go on contribute to asthma and if you go on Google and you type in Google and you type in Google and you type in Asma Dairy and the very first thing that Asma Dairy and the very first thing that Asma Dairy and the very first thing that comes up in your search is from the comes up in your search is from

very helpfully gone straight which has very helpfully gone straight in and answered this question for us in and answered this question for us in and answered this question for us dairy foods have often been suggested as dairy foods have often been suggested as dairy foods have often been suggested as a common trigger for asthma but there's a common trigger for asthma but there's a common trigger for asthma but there's little scientific evidence to support little scientific evidence to support little scientific evidence to support this myth and unfortunately most this myth and unfortunately most this myth and unfortunately most Australians are missing out on the Australians are missing out on the Australians are missing out on the health benefits that come from consuming

they sick so I looked at the report that they sick so I looked at the report that they had quoted they they gave references to had quoted they they gave references to had quoted they they gave references to the studies that supposedly show that it the studies that supposedly show that it the studies that supposedly show that it doesn't work and they weren't very big doesn't work and they weren't very big doesn't work and they weren't very big studies but I looked at one one was from studies but I looked at one one was from studies but I looked at one one was from New York University in 1991 had 11 New York University in 1991 had 11 New York University in 1991 had 11 adults they all had asthma and they adults they all had asthma and they adults they all had asthma and they drank either whole milk skim milk or drank either whole milk skim milk or drank either whole milk skim milk or water and what they showed is if they water and what they showed is if they water and what they showed is if they drank whole milk their ability to have drank whole milk their ability to have drank whole milk their ability to have uh gases passed through their lungs got uh gases passed through their lungs got uh gases passed through their lungs got progressively worse from the milk and progressively worse from the milk and progressively worse from the milk and they thought it had to do perhaps with they thought it had to do perhaps with they thought it had to do perhaps with the fatty the fatty the fatty milk so cheese would even be worse then milk so cheese would even be worse then milk so cheese would even be worse then there was a UK study from the United there was a UK study from the United there was a UK study from the United Kingdom it kids they were between three Kingdom it kids they were between three Kingdom it kids they were between three and 14 years of age and they gave them a and 14 years of age and they gave them a and 14 years of age and they gave them a milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and and the way you test this if if you know and the way you test this if if you know and the way you test this if if you know anybody who has asthma if you have it anybody who has asthma if you have it anybody who has asthma if you have it yourself you try to see if the kid can yourself you try to see if the kid can yourself you try to see if the kid can breathe out if they can have good breathe out if they can have good breathe out if they can have good expiratory flow because that's what expiratory flow because that's what expiratory flow because that's what tends to go bad and what they showed is tends to go bad and what they showed is tends to go bad and what they showed is that if they went egg and dairy free that if they went egg and dairy free that if they went egg and dairy free their ability to breathe out was much their ability to breathe out was much their ability to breathe out was much much much better it really helped them much much better it really helped them much much better it really helped them clear up now this was a study that went clear up now this was a study that went clear up now this was a study that went over eight weeks and it just so happened over eight weeks and it just so happened over eight weeks and it just so happened that Easter was in the middle of that that Easter was in the middle of that that Easter was in the middle of that period so they went to the Chocolate period so they went to the Chocolate period so they went to the Chocolate Factory and said okay do you have Factory and said okay do you have Factory and said okay do you have non-dairy bunnies for us which they did non-dairy bunnies for us which they did non-dairy bunnies for us which they did and these kids got a lot better bottom and these kids got a lot better bottom and these kids got a lot better bottom line is couldn't find evidence that set line is couldn't find evidence that set line is couldn't find evidence that set this aside people haven't really looked this aside people haven't really looked this aside people haven't really looked at it very much at all because no one's at it very much at all because no one's at it very much at all because no one's making money if you stop consuming milk making money if you stop consuming milk

interferes with everything you're trying to do and everything you're trying to do and everything you're trying to do and everybody who has uh migraines has heard everybody who has uh migraines has heard everybody who has uh migraines has heard about these trigger foods um age cheeses about these trigger foods um age cheeses about these trigger foods um age cheeses sausage fermented foods and what they sausage fermented foods and what they sausage fermented foods and what they are telling you as every website on are telling you as every website on are telling you as every website on asthma will say is that these foods have asthma will say is that these foods have asthma will say is that these foods have tyrosine which converts to tyramine and tyrosine which converts to tyramine and tyrosine which converts to tyramine and that tightens up your brain that tightens up your brain that tightens up your brain true however we have seen a lot of true however we have seen a lot of true however we have seen a lot of people have migraines that are triggered people have migraines that are triggered people have migraines that are triggered by other things too and it doesn't by other things too and it doesn't by other things too and it doesn't necessarily have to to be that and at necessarily have to to be that and at necessarily have to to be that and at the hospital for sick children in London the hospital for sick children in London the hospital for sick children in London back in back in back in 1983 they started exploring this they 1983 they started exploring this they 1983 they started exploring this they brought in a group of kids 88 kids and brought in a group of kids 88 kids and brought in a group of kids 88 kids and they put them on an Elimination Diet not they put them on an Elimination Diet not they put them on an Elimination Diet not just eliminating Dairy but other common just eliminating Dairy but other common just eliminating Dairy but other common allergens and 78 of the kids were allergens and 78 of the kids were allergens and 78 of the kids were completely headache completely headache completely headache free and four had a partial Improvement free and four had a partial Improvement free and four had a partial Improvement so this is good now in adults I don't so this is good now in adults I don't so this is good now in adults I don't see quite that degree of success but we see quite that degree of success but we see quite that degree of success but we do see it uh up to about 50% and there do see it uh up to about 50% and there do see it uh up to about 50% and there are a number number of triggers other are a number number of triggers other are a number number of triggers other than Dairy that that sometimes can be than Dairy that that sometimes can be than Dairy that that sometimes can be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be the most commonly reported one and if the most commonly reported one and if the most commonly reported one and if you're dealing with migraines and can't you're dealing with migraines and can't you're dealing with migraines and can't function and are stuck on medications function and are stuck on medications function and are stuck on medications day after day it's really really really day after day it's really really really day after day it's really really really worth it to get the dairy out of your worth it to get the dairy out of your worth it to get the dairy out of your diet and see how you do so Lauren's got diet and see how you do so Lauren's got diet and see how you do so Lauren's got no Migra no no migraines anymore all no Migra no no migraines anymore all no Migra no no migraines anymore all right let's talk about rheumatoid right let's talk about rheumatoid right let's talk about rheumatoid arthritis if you look into your arthritis if you look into your arthritis if you look

are one of the ones that Dairy proteins are one of the ones that Dairy proteins are one of the ones that people are sensitive to so researchers people are sensitive to so researchers people are sensitive to so researchers have looked into this and starting with have looked into this and starting with have looked into this and starting with an individual case report back in 1985 an individual case report back in 1985 an individual case report back in 1985 as one girl she had terrible juvenile as one girl she had terrible juvenile as one girl she had terrible juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor said thoughtful doctor said get away said thoughtful doctor said get away said thoughtful doctor said get away from dairy this could be it symptoms from dairy this could be it symptoms from dairy this could be it symptoms completely remitted and then she went completely remitted and then she went completely remitted and then she went and visited Grandma who would give her and visited Grandma who would give her and visited Grandma who would give her milk chocolate candy and her symptoms milk chocolate candy and her symptoms milk chocolate candy and her symptoms came back and she got off it and the came back and she got off it and the came back and she got off it and the symptoms went away and then a symptoms went away and then a symptoms went away and then a pediatrician said this can't be true you pediatrician said this can't be true you pediatrician said this can't be true you should have milk for calcium her should have milk for calcium her should have milk for calcium her symptoms came back and they went back symptoms came back and they went back symptoms came back and they went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and the pattern became and forth and the pattern became and forth and the pattern became inescapable so they published the uh inescapable so they published the uh inescapable so they published the uh findings in the Journal of the Royal findings in the Journal of the Royal findings in the Journal of the Royal Society of medicine saying here's one Society of medicine saying here's one Society of medicine saying here's one case maybe other people have Diet uh case maybe other people have Diet uh case maybe other people have Diet uh induced arthritis and so triggers have induced arthritis and so triggers have induced arthritis and so triggers have been identified not in everybody but been identified not in everybody but been identified not in everybody but somewhere between 20 and 60% of people somewhere between 20 and 60% of people somewhere between 20 and 60% of people in research studies and in a SL Norway in research studies and in a SL Norway in research studies and in a SL Norway researchers brought in a group of people researchers brought in a group of people researchers brought in a group of people and started them on a juice fast and and started them on a juice fast and and started them on a juice fast and then a vegan diet and then a lacto then a vegan diet and then a lacto then a vegan diet and then a lacto vegetarian diet but within the very vegetarian diet but within the very vegetarian diet but within the very first month they found clear-cut first month they found clear-cut first month they found clear-cut symptomatic Improvement and reduction in symptomatic Improvement and reduction in symptomatic Improvement and reduction in in biomarkers as well uh less pain less in biomarkers as well uh less pain less in biomarkers as well uh less pain less tenderness less swelling and then John tenderness less swelling and then John tenderness less swelling and then John McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan just a vegan low-fat diet and found that just a vegan low-fat diet and found that just a vegan low-fat diet and found that within a four-week time frame you saw uh within a four-week time frame you saw uh within a four-week time frame you saw uh improvements particularly in people who improvements particularly in people who improvements particularly in people who are relatively new to having rheumatoid are relatively new to having rheumatoid are relatively new to having rheumatoid arthritis arthritis arthritis okay prostate cancer is one of the most okay prostate cancer is one of the most okay prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer that we have common forms of cancer that we have common forms of cancer that we have obviously and for many many years obviously and for many many years obviously and for many many years researchers have said this is something researchers have said this is something researchers have said this is something that it goes with milk that the that it goes with milk that the that it goes with milk that the countries that have the highest milk countries that have the highest milk countries that have the highest milk consumption that's on the on the right consumption that's on the on the right consumption that's on the on the right hand side they've got the most prostate hand side they've got the most prostate hand side they've got the most prostate cancer well at Harvard the physicians's cancer well at Harvard the physicians's cancer well at Harvard the physicians's health study said in our group of 21,000 health study said in our group of 21,000 health study said in our group of 21,000 Physicians it's true two and a half Physicians it's true two and a half Physicians it's true two and a half servings of dairy products a day every servings of dairy products a day every servings of dairy products a day every day increases your risk of prostate day increases your risk of prostate day increases your risk of prostate cancer about 34% they did another study cancer about 34% they did another study cancer about 34% they did another study called the health professionals called the health professionals called the health professionals follow-up study same thing the more milk follow-up study same thing the more milk follow-up study same thing the more milk the more prostate cancer in this case the more prostate cancer in this case the more prostate cancer in this case 60% so what we believe is happening is 60% so what we believe is happening is 60% so what we believe is happening is that the hormonal effects from the that the hormonal effects from the that the hormonal effects from the milk trigger either the initiation of milk trigger either the initiation of milk trigger either the initiation of cancer or more likely the aggressive cancer or more likely the aggressive cancer or more likely the aggressive growth of cancers that happen to form so growth of cancers that happen to form so growth of cancers that happen to form so rather than having those

        "content": "••• GREEN JUICING •••\nBased on my experience in various health groups, I'd like to share four key insights:\n1. Ease of Adoption:\nSome health advice is easier said than done. For example, consuming green leafy vegetables without using oil or ghee is challenging in Indian cuisine, where saag is a common preparation requiring these fats.\n2. Dietary Changes:\nIt is often hard to give up our favorite foods even when we know they are unhealthy. However, introducing tasty, healthy options can naturally displace less healthy choices.\n3. Impact of Changes:\nGradual changes often yield less noticeable improvements which can lead to a loss of confidence. Making a few dramatic changes can keep these efforts top of mind and encourage persistence.\n4.Ripple Effects:\nA single conscious change can lead to multiple subconscious improvements and accrue significant benefits. For example, starting a daily walking routine led me to naturally reject calorie-dense snacks like cookies and donuts, mindful of the effort I'd put into walking.\nWhy Green Juice?\nGreen leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which help release Nitric Oxide in the bloodstream, unclogging blood vessels and reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues.\nWhen I discussed dietary guidelines I mentioned that we need to consume a minimum 1% of our body weight in vegetables and half of that should be in green leafy vegetables. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn suggests six daily servings of green leafy vegetables for heart patients, including notable individuals like Bill Clinton. Given the culinary habits in India where salads are uncommon, I recommend juicing as a practical alternative, although it's second to consuming greens raw or blanched.\nI recommend watching the documentaries “Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead\" available on Netflix, and \"Super Juice Me\" on YouTube. These showcase dramatic health transformations through extended juice fasts. Inspired by these, I started with a five-day juice fast 11 years ago that transformed my life.\nOne should start with a 3-5 day juice fast, consuming 8-12 ounces of juice four to five times a day. After that continue with three glasses daily 15-20 minutes before meals to maximize health benefits until you can reduce or eliminate chronic medications.\nThe main goal here is to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetables (fruits should be eaten as a whole or to just make vegetable juice tastier). Juicing makes it easy.\nSelecting A Juicer\nAs green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed, especially for people who are on medications or want to lose weight.\nConsider hydraulic, double helical screw, and single augur juicers based on your budget and needs. Avoid high-speed centrifugal juicers as they can degrade nutrients and are less effective with leafy greens.\nFor patients who are critically ill, it is advisable to consume juice with minimum pulp. It is light on their stomach and for the same amount of fullness, they can consume more nutrients. (Not sure you need the last line re: cancer here since you mention critically ill above).\nDo You Lose Fiber?\nA question often asked is “aren’t you removing fiber in juicing?”\nThe answer is that there are two types of fiber- soluble and insoluble. Juicing retains soluble fiber and some of the insoluble fiber as well. One should eat fruits as a whole and juice only vegetables. You can add some fruit to enhance the taste and yes Granny Smith apples because they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables.\nThere is a saying: First thing in the morning, if you poop before you finish peeing; you are in good health. You soon will experience that.\nGreen Juice Recipe\nBefore diving into the recipe, it's important to note that there isn't a strict chemical composition required for making juice. Unlike the precise formulations often found in Ayurveda, the primary aim of juicing is to enjoy consuming green leafy vegetables in a tasty beverage, rather than enduring a bitter concoction solely for health benefits. Since everyone's taste preferences vary, feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your liking. The goal is to create a juice that's so delicious, your guests will ask for a second glass.\nConsider the recipe as consisting of three main groups of vegetables, along with some seeds:\n1. Apples and Spice Group: This includes four Granny Smith apples (or any other suitable juicing apples), two lemons, and two thumb-sized pieces of ginger.\n2. Hydration Group: Comprising one bunch of celery, one large English cucumber (or two medium regular cucumbers), and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the juice's water content, and you can easily double these ingredients if desired.\n3.Leafy Greens Group: Choose any combination of one to three of the following: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beetroot greens, cabbage, etc. (2-3 bunches total). Alternatively, for a variation, replace this group with carrots and beetroots.\nEnhance your juice by adding some flax seeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds. These seeds not only fulfill part of your Omega-3 needs but also provide fats that aid in nutrient absorption. Don't hesitate to include other non-starchy vegetables like bottle gourd, butter melon, raw turmeric, and mint. There are no restrictions—let your taste buds guide you!\nHere is a typical green juice mixture in my kitchen. See in the picture from left to right:\nChard, Kale, Arugula, Bottle Gourd, Romaine lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Beetroot, Raw Turmeric root, Green apple, Carrot and Fenel.\nShelf Life\nJuice can be stored safely in airtight glass bottles in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours or frozen for longer storage, leaving space for expansion.\nOrganic vs Nonorganic\nAlways thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables. Seek organic sources if possible, but don't avoid conventional produce out of fear of pesticides; the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh the potential risks.\nI recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market near you. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will remember you and always tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided.\nJUICE vs SMOOTHY\nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions and there clearly is big confusion on this subject, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this. Before proceeding I want to make it clear that eating leafy greens raw as salad or blanched is the best option. The chewing action in the mouth mixed with saliva provides the most nutrition and absorption. Fruits ofcourse shoul always be eaten as whole fruits except some green apples (Granny Smith variety in US as they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables) which should be added to green juice. So the question is only, what is the second best option.\n1. Smoothies require high speed blending, this makes the air oxidize the nutrients. So you have some nutrient loss due to oxidization.\n2. Because you have to mix a cup of water to start the process and because the pulp is retained, there are only half as many nutrients in a glass of smoothie as opposed to a glass of juice.\n3. Because of air and insoluble fiber you can not consume much smoothie and make up for reduced nutrients by drinking more. On the contrary the juice feels less filling than smoothie.\n4. A good juicer retains most of the soluble fiber in juice. Some of the insoluble fiber is also retained in small particles that go through the screen. The remaining insoluble fiber which is rejected, has little nutrient left. It is also not needed for bowl movement because one gets more than enough from juice.\n5. Juice does not stay in stomach much and passes through to small intestine quickly. Smoothies need to be digested and remain much longer in the stomach. Smoothies are not a good choice for juice fasts.\n6. Juice has a much longer refrigeration shelf life. You can juice only twice a week and store it in airtight glass bottles. It can also be frozen so one can reduce juice making to even once a week.\nThis post clarifies green juicing, its benefits, and its practical implementation, aiming to promote better health practices and dietary adjustments.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•Observations from Q&A Session•\nDuring the Q&A session, many of you asked questions about your health and how to recover from lifestyle diseases. As I explained in my post titled “2 Most FAQs,” the diet and lifestyle recommendations are not different for different lifestyle diseases. However, they can vary from person to person.\nWhile we humans are genetically quite similar, we are epigenetically very different. Our microbiome composition—shaped by our unique diets and lifestyles—plays a major role in how diseases manifest. This means that even if symptoms appear similar, the root causes can differ significantly between individuals. The reverse is also true: the same underlying cause may show up as very different symptoms in different people. That’s why trying to guess the cause based on symptoms alone is an imperfect science, full of hits and misses. I don’t practice that kind of guesswork. Doctors and naturopaths often do, with varying levels of success.\nA far more reliable approach is to assess your current diet and lifestyle using the 12-point guideline I’ve provided. This will help you identify areas of non-compliance that need correction. When you align with these guidelines, the body begins to heal—and when the body heals, all diseases caused by poor diet and lifestyle begin to resolve.\nBut this process is personal. Only you can determine whether your body is aligned with these principles, because your microbiome is unique to you. Once you’ve ensured that:\n- Your food is 100% plant-based and whole,\n- You’re eating within an 8–10 hour daytime window,\n- Roughly 20% of your calories come from each food group,\n- You’re including a variety of foods from each of the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, beans&legumes and nuts&seeds.\nThen there is no further adjustment needed. Whether you eat potatoes, sweet potatoes, or taro root (arbi) on a given day is entirely your choice. Listen to your body—it will guide you. Since variety is important, I suggest including at least seven different foods from each food group every week, along with a wide range of spices. Spices are rich in antioxidants and should ideally be consumed daily, with each meal.\nAs I mentioned in yesterday’s post, “2 Most FAQs,” many of you are still asking the very questions I addressed there. It also appears that some of you haven’t yet read my posts on the protein and dairy myths. I strongly encourage you to go through them—all your questions are answered there.\nThis week, we’ll cover the remaining four pillars of health: detoxification, circadian rhythm, physical activity, and emotional and spiritual well-being.",

        "content": "• CONFESSIONS OF A PHARMA EXEC •\nThe consumption of medications is not as harmless as many believe. All drugs come with side effects and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Pharmaceutical companies often try to avoid disclosing these risks.\nThe following video features Dr. John Virapen, an Indian executive who worked for Eli Lilly, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Dr. Virapen courageously exposed some of the industry’s darkest secrets. Please watch the linked video below.\nHere are some quotes from his talk:\n1. “The pharmaceutical industry is not interested in curing any disease you may have. They are more interested in making sure you stay sick. They focus on symptomatic treatment. They prefer patients with chronic conditions—diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s, rheumatoid arthritis, arteriosclerosis—because such patients live a long time and must take medication for the rest of their lives.”\n2. “A few years ago, Eli Lilly was fined $1.4 billion by a Pennsylvania court for knowingly selling the schizophrenia drug Zyprexa to elderly patients. The drug made them drowsy—and also diabetic. Ironically, Eli Lilly is the largest producer of diabetes medications in the world.”\n3. “But the news of this settlement never came out. Do you know why? Because the media also works with the pharmaceutical industry—just like the government does.”\n4. “Pharma companies use the media to cover up their dirty work. You only learn the truth when it’s too late. So you need to raise your awareness. Don’t blindly trust what your doctor tells you—because many of them are ignorant. They know little about the drugs they prescribe and care even less about the patients. They’re often focused on how much they’ll get paid. That’s how the pharma industry stays in power. They buy the doctors. And doctors get all their information from the pharmaceutical companies.”\n5. “I know this because I was a pharmaceutical salesman. I was told never to talk about side effects. We were trained to use a method called FAB—Features, Advantages, Benefits. Talking about side effects was taboo. I also know for a fact that they hide serious side effects. I was in charge of the clinical trial for Prozac.”\n6. “Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush’s father served on the board of Eli Lilly. One of George W. Bush’s advisors was a vice president at Eli Lilly. Donald Rumsfeld also held a top executive role in the pharmaceutical industry. Eli Lilly is one of the biggest financial contributors to the Republican Party.\n7. “That, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest form of corruption. It’s called lobbying.”\nDr. John Virapen on the Drug Industry\nhttps://youtu.be/jTweQVGAwVo\nPharma Not in the Business of Health",

However, the actual victims of the opioid epidemic—those who developed addictions or lost loved ones—will see little direct compensation. Most of the funds will go to state and local governments to support efforts addressing the crisis.\nMeanwhile, many Americans have transitioned from prescription painkillers to street drugs like fentanyl, a far more dangerous synthetic opioid. Their suffering continues, with no end in sight.\nPharmaceutical companies, for their part, treat such massive settlements as simply the cost of doing business. With no personal accountability, no jail time for executives, and no meaningful reforms, the cycle of abuse and profit continues.\nOpioid Lawsuit Settlement – Apple News",

        "content": "•BELIEVE IT OR NOT•\nStarch is actually healthy for diabetics. The real problem—for diabetics and non-diabetics alike—is sugar and refined foods. Surprisingly, so-called “low glycemic” foods can sometimes be more harmful for diabetics. That’s because many animal products and processed foods have a relatively low glycemic index (GI) but a high insulin index. For example, prawns have a glycemic index of zero, and pure fructose has a GI of only 25—yet both can be very harmful for diabetics.\nThe key point is this: insulin spikes are more damaging than sugar spikes.\nThis was clearly demonstrated in a study led by Dr. Robert Lustig at UCSF. A group of 43 obese children between the ages of 9 and 19—who regularly consumed high-sugar, ultra-processed foods—were put on a diet nearly identical to their usual one, with one crucial change: added sugar was replaced with starch. Their calorie intake and body weight were kept constant for nine days.\nThe results were striking:\n- Visceral fat decreased by 7%\n- Liver fat dropped by 22%\n- Triglyceride levels fell by 49%\n- The rate at which their bodies converted sugar into fat decreased by 46%\n- Both blood glucose and insulin levels improved significantly\nAs liver fat reduced, the pancreas began to function better and could produce insulin more effectively.\nIn other words, the children’s metabolic syndrome was reversed—without any weight loss or calorie restriction. This proves an important point: not all calories are equal. Refined sugar is far more damaging to metabolic health than starch, protein, or fat.\nAnother serious issue with ultra-processed foods is their lack of fiber. While high-carb diets are often blamed for poor health, studies show that diets high in fiber-rich carbohydrates can produce similar metabolic benefits to low-carb diets. However, low-carb diets may come with long-term risks—such as increased susceptibility to kidney and liver disease in old age.\nWatch the related video here:\nhttps://youtu.be/K3JyEfsROXk?si=cEm4OJVC0_KMyeun\n——————————\nEND OF POST\n——————————",

        "content": "• PLACEBO & NOCEBO EFFECTS •\nWe have long known that a patient’s belief in a particular medication or treatment plays a significant role in their recovery. Many alternative forms of treatment—practiced for centuries, even millennia—have produced surprising results.\nI still remember visiting Hakims and Vaidyas over 70 years ago. These traditional healers (often incorrectly referred to as “doctors”) had excellent bedside manners. They would ask many detailed questions: What are you eating? How is your urine and stool? Any aches or pains? What is the color of your tongue and eyes? After a thorough examination, they would give a small paper package of medicine (called pudia) and advise dietary restrictions (parhej)—what to avoid and what to include while on the treatment.\nIn most cases, people would recover within a week or two. But the question remains: What actually healed the body?\n- Was it the medication?\n- Was it the dietary changes?\n- Did the body heal itself?\n- Or was it the positive belief that triggered healing?\nWhat I have learned from doctors in the PBWF (Plant-Based Whole-Food) movement is that the human body is an incredibly sophisticated organism that is always trying to heal itself. So, most likely, healing came from a combination of #2, #3, and #4. What was in that pudia may not have made a real difference.\nModern medicine understands this phenomenon well. All new drugs must go through rigorous double-blind clinical trials. In such trials, patients are randomly divided into two groups. One group receives the actual drug being tested; the other receives an inactive substance with no therapeutic value (a placebo). Importantly, both groups are told they are receiving the real drug.\nSurprisingly, both groups often show improvement. For a drug to be approved, the group receiving the real medication must show statistically better results than the placebo group. These are called double-blind trials because neither the patient nor the doctor knows who is getting what.\nInterestingly, in recent years we have come to understand that the opposite of the placebo effect is also true. It’s called the Nocebo effect: when we strongly believe something bad is going to happen to us—it often does.\nIn ancient Indian Puranic stories, curses were frequently mentioned. It’s possible that the principle behind these curses was very similar to what we now call the Nocebo effect.\nPlease watch the videos linked below to learn more about this fascinating subject. 👇",

        "content": "•Modern vs. Alternate Medicine•\nThe self-healing ability of the human body may not have been fully understood in earlier times, as it is today. As a result, the benefits observed from various forms of treatment were often attributed to the specific method used, rather than recognizing that the improvements could be due to the placebo effect. This led to the development of numerous theories and treatment modalities.\nToday, we—the so-called educated class—refer to these unconventional approaches as Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). (The term “complementary” was added later.) Traditional alternative medicine includes:\n* Acupuncture\n* Ayurveda\n* Chiropractic\n* Homeopathy\n* Hydrotherapy\n* Magnetic Therapy\n* Naturopathy\n* Unani Medicine\n* Chinese & Oriental Medicine\n* Gem Therapy\n* Spiritual Healing (e.g., Tabiz and Vibhuti)\nI’m sure many more could be added to this list. These therapies were widely practiced in different parts of the world until the early 20th century.\nSo, the question is: when did these therapies become “alternative”?\nAt the time, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie were the two wealthiest men in America—Rockefeller held a monopoly over the oil industry (controlling 90% of it), while Carnegie dominated steel. Both were involved in philanthropy and supported many social causes.\nIn 1908, they proposed to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the U.S. government that it would be beneficial to evaluate the state of medical education and standardize it. It appeared to be a noble initiative. Carnegie hired an educator named Abraham Flexner for the job. (Abraham was the brother of Simon Flexner, a scientist at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.)\nAfter more than a year of research and travel across the U.S. and Canada, Abraham Flexner submitted a comprehensive report in 1910 titled “Medical Education in the United States and Canada”, now commonly known as the Flexner Report.\nThe report recommended the closure of all two-year diploma programs and the establishment of a standardized four-year curriculum. Strangely, the curriculum excluded any training in nutrition, even though herbal medicine made up nearly half of all treatments at the time.\nThe U.S. government accepted the recommendations, and what we now know as modern medicine began to take shape.\nThe aftermath was significant:\n- All alternative treatments were effectively banned unless practiced by a licensed MD.\n- Many small medical schools were closed or absorbed into larger institutions, often funded by powerful business interests.\n- In under a decade, the number of medical colleges dropped from 650 to 50, and the number of medical students declined from 7,500 to 2,500.\n- Numerous alternative practices were labeled as quackery and outlawed.\n- Only those trained in the new four-year system and licensed to practice were permitted to prescribe medicine.\n- Abraham Flexner was later appointed as the first director of Rockefeller’s philanthropic medical education programs.",

        "content": "A placebo is a treatment with zero therapeutic value but magical healing power. Common placebos include sugar pills inert saline injections, other procedures and surgeries that are completely fake. Placebos are especially effective to treat pain, chronic stress related diseases, like insomnia, and forms of depression. What most don't realize is that while placebos are fake the placebo effect does it's magic even if you get real treatments from a normal doctor. Placebos tend to follow one simple rule: the more ritualized and extreme the fake treatment the more effective their effect. In short, sugar pills work well, sham surgery works wonders. Since standard doctor appointments are often highly ritualized the placebo effect is part of the cure we think we receive. To understand this better let's look at Mr. and Mrs. Martin who both suffer chronic back pain. Mr. Martin feels the pain first and he decides to go see a doctor who diagnoses osteoporosis and treats him with physiotherapy. After a few days of treatment, Mr. Martin feels better. He starts to track the progress of his pain. He soon learns that he always goes to the doctor on the days when the pain is the worst and always feels better soon after. He becomes a big advocate for physiotherapy and recommends it to his wife and she joins him. But do we really know that the therapy works? Despite months of therapy things get worse for both Mr. and Mrs. Martin. Together they go to the hospital where Mr. Martin's doctor prescribes painkillers. Mrs. Martin decides to get a second opinion. Her new doctor has recently learned that for some chronic pain placebos work equally well. Instead of giving Mrs. Martin painkillers the doctor prescribes simple sugar pills though he tells Mrs. Martin that they are pain killers. The next day they both feel much better. Mr. Martin notices that he has no problem sawing wood and Mrs. Martin can easily put on her shoes. She can confirm that the painkillers work but do they really? Unfortunately, it doesn't take long before the pain comes back and they return to the hospital. Mr. Martin is now treated with vertebroplasty, a popular treatment offered to people who suffer from back pain due to osteoporosis. To administer it the doctors inject cement directly into his vertebrae, the bones that form the spinal column. Mrs. Martin's doctor simply has her smell a container full of cement and then administers a saline injection, which does nothing. Her doctor learned about this placebo from research published in the U.S. National Library of Medicine. It showed that a large randomized controlled trial found no benefit of vertebroplasty over a sham procedure. Right after the surgery the Martin's meet in the lobby and share their experience of the process: both feel great! Mrs. Martin invites her husband for ice cream as her treatment was so much cheaper. So what's happening here? There are a couple of theories that try to explain the placebo effect. First there is regression to the mean: Mr. Martin like most of us thinks about treatment when his symptoms are particularly bad. He goes to see a doctor and soon after feels better. If we look at the natural course of many illnesses we understand that pain, over time, comes and goes in swings and usually regresses to the mean. We don't know if the doctor or placebo had anything to do with the improvement. Then there is classical conditioning: most treatments, including vertebroplasty, are delivered in a context of rituals that include social signals, physical cues, and verbal suggestions. Mr. Martin's brain interprets such cues and elicits expectations memories and emotions, it releases endorphins and other chemicals that make him feel good and lower his perception of pain. So it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy where a belief that he feels better leads him to feel better. And there is confirmation bias: as soon as Mrs. Martin takes the sugar pill she thinks she will feel better. Then she focuses only on the things that confirm that she is better. She doesn't realize that she still has trouble doing many other things. While all three ideas probably work together there is another theory: so-called mirror neurons might also play a role. A new and growing body of evidence points at brain cells that mirror behavior. The cells fire when one acts and when one observes the same action performed by another. As Mrs. Martin talks to the doctor parts of the doctors brain will mirror parts of her brain and parts of her brain will mirror his, as a result, the structure of her brain changes and she feels less pain. The neurophysiologist Giacomo Rizzolatti who discovered mirror neurons suggests that this process bypasses consciousness and provides a direct mapping of sensory information onto motor structures. Placebo, a Latin word that means \"I will please\", have been used for thousands of years. Placebo effects have been discussed for centuries. An influential study from 1955 by Henry Kay Beecher, Harvard, titled: the powerful placebo established the idea that the effect is clinically important. Today the placebo effect is well recognized and scientifically so significant that any new pain medication that seeks Food and Drug Administration approval in the United States needs to show that it works better than a placebo treatment. In so-called randomized controlled trials, the gold standard of medical research, one group of patients is given the new medication while a control group receives a placebo. Neither the doctors who hand out the medication nor the patients know who gets what. Once the trial is over results are compared. If the new medication works significantly better than the placebo it's allowed to be sold. The trial is surprisingly difficult from 10 new drugs entering the test one gets approval. If a placebo study proves that an existing standard medical procedure is ineffective, like in the case of vertebroplasty, competent doctors stop prescribing it and we can speak of medical reversal. To find out if an existing treatment works or if it's healing power is just the result of the placebo effect we can administer treatment without the knowledge of the patients. In one such experiment it was shown that if a painkiller is administered by a hidden robot pump, patients demanded twice the dose compared to when the drug is injected by a nurse. This would suggest that if a patient is completely unaware that treatment is being given, the treatment is just half as effective. The placebo effect counts for the other half. Honest placebo studies go even further. Because deception is ethically questionable researchers have now started to do clinical trials in which people are told that all they get is a sugar pill with placebo printed all over the packaging. And even then the placebo effect does it's magic and helps you feel better. One experiment at the Harvard Medical School showed that people suffering from irritable bowel syndrome who were taking the honest placebo doubled their rate of improvement compared to the control group. What do you think? How can we make sure that the medicine we are prescribing is not only effective thanks to the placebo effect? Will more placebo research reveal that many standard medical treatments offered in some of the best hospitals around the world are shams? And how can we research the power of placeboes ourselves, at home, without putting anyone in danger? If you like this video and the way we explain the subject subscribe to our channel!

        "content": "•Doctors’ Advice on Medications•\nPlease do not send me details about your medications. I am not a doctor, and I’m not interested in knowing the specific names of drugs. All I need to know is whether you are taking any chronic medications and for what conditions.\nYou should ask yourself: Why am I taking this medication for the rest of my life?\nDoctors are quick to prescribe medications because that is what they are taught in medical school. Once you start a medication, you often become a patient for life. That means you have to visit the doctor regularly just to get your prescriptions refilled. In India, many patients are also partly to blame—if a doctor doesn’t prescribe medicine, they feel disappointed or cheated.\nGetting people off medications is not considered good practice in today’s system—it’s bad for business. So here are a few important observations:\n* Doctors are quick to prescribe medication. It is not their fault. They are not trained in nutrition (because it’s not part of standard medical education). As a result, they often avoid discussing it.\n* Time constraints are another issue—doctors must see many patients, and the next one is always waiting.\n* There is something called the “Medical Standard of Care.” These are the guidelines doctors must follow to keep their license to practice. If they don’t follow them, they could face lawsuits from patients or their families. This is more common in the U.S. than in India. In the U.S., the “Medical Standard of Care” is set by the governing bodies of each specialty. For example: (1) A General Practioner who is a member of ACP must follow guidelines of ACP. (2) A diabetes doctor must follow the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and (3) An endocrinologist should follow the guidelines established by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE).\n* These governing bodies primarily serve the interests of their members, who pay regular membership fees. When new research suggests lowering the threshold for prescribing medication, they are quick to adopt those recommendations. But when new findings suggest a more conservative or less profitable approach, they are often slow\n—or unwilling—to change. This leads to conflicting guidelines.\nIn 2018 when ACP issued revised diabetes treatment relaxing them from 6.5 to 8.0 reading for HbA1C there was a huge hue and cry as this would have reduced many practitioners income by 49-60 percent. Within a week AACE reiterated their guidelines of 6.5% to protect income of their members.\nThis is human nature. Once people become used to higher income, they resist any change that might reduce it. A Hindi couplet written 500 years ago captures this perfectly:\n“Badhat badhat sampatti salil, man saroj badh jai,\nGhatat ghatat, puni na ghate, varu samul kumbhlaye.”\nTranslation:\nAs one’s wealth increases, so do his desires—just like a lotus in a pond that rises with the water level. When the water recedes, the lotus cannot adjust and withers away.\nWhen your symptoms improve and you ask your doctor if you can stop taking medications, the answer is usually “No.” That’s because your doctor has been taught to believe that chronic conditions are incurable. From his perspective, your symptoms have improved only because of the medication.\nAs we begin to discuss specific diseases and medications, you will encounter these challenges. Some members have already written to me, saying they plan to ask their doctor about reducing medications. When you do this, please go prepared—have your data (your “ducks”) lined up.\nThis is why, in defining the objective of this group, I specifically state:\n“The goal is to empower members to get off chronic medications by teaching them an active lifestyle based on a PBWF (Plant-Based Whole-Foods) diet and Intermittent Fasting.”\nSome of you ask me as to how can you convince your doctors to reduce your medicine. This is a very difficult task. Most doctors don’t have the time to reeducate themselves. Also specially if it means reducing their income level by half or more.",

        "content": "• In Defense of Doctors •\nMost people live their young adult lives free of chronic diseases (I’m not referring to infectious diseases here). When you visit a doctor for the first time as an adult—usually around the age of 45–50—and he checks your blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and other markers, he has no idea about the trajectory of those markers.\nFor example, if your blood test shows an A1C of 7.8, he doesn’t know how rapidly that number has been increasing. Is it rising at a rate of 0.1 per month, or just 0.01? In that situation, it is prudent for him to assume the worst-case scenario. So, he prescribes medication. His objectives are twofold:\n1. To change the trajectory and prevent the disease from getting worse.\n2. To bring the marker into a range recommended by the professional association that governs his specialty.\nFor instance, if the doctor is a general practitioner and a member of the American College of Physicians (ACP), the guideline is to keep A1C below 8.0. His goal is simply to prevent the progression of diabetes, so a small dose of medication might be sufficient.\nIf the doctor is a member of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), he aims to bring the A1C below 7.0 and will likely prescribe a higher dose.\nIf the doctor is an endocrinologist and a member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), his target is an A1C below 6.5. He may prescribe two medications.\nMost people, after leaving the doctor’s office and filling the prescription, start taking their medications regularly—but only make minor changes to their diet and lifestyle. The most common ones include replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners and switching from regular soft drinks to diet sodas (which, as we will see in later posts, can actually worsen the condition).\nNow, if a particular patient—like yourself—is more conscientious and makes significant changes to diet and lifestyle, the numbers may improve dramatically by the time of the next doctor’s visit. However, when you ask the doctor to stop the medication, he may strongly resist. That’s because, during his medical training, he was taught that chronic diseases cannot be cured. He firmly believes your improved markers are due solely to the medication.\nIn my experience working with over 250,000 members, I encounter this situation frequently. Sooner or later, each one of you will face this same dilemma. That’s why I am raising this issue now—before we begin our in-depth discussion of chronic diseases starting next week. Each of you will need to find your own path and, eventually, have this conversation with your doctor.",

        "content": "•Alternate Medicine:\nIs it Only a Placebo Effect?•\nMany who share success stories with alternative medicine aren’t lying or trying to promote an agenda. Some of these stories seem miraculous, turning people into lifelong believers. However, not all such successes are due to the placebo effect. My goal is to explain how various factors can influence our judgment and contribute to the spread of myths. Here are some factors to consider:\n1. The human body is a self-healing organism, constantly striving to repair itself. Cells die and regenerate regularly, with cycles ranging from days to months.\n2. When we’re sick, we tend to improve our diet and lifestyle unconsciously, which can aid recovery.\n3. Because of these factors, the body usually heals itself. Recovery times vary based on the illness, ranging from weeks to years.\n4. In times of illness, we often start by consulting traditional medical professionals. If treatments don’t work, we may turn to alternative therapies like Homeopathy, Ayurveda, or Acupuncture.\n5. Sometimes, recovery coincides with trying alternative treatments, leading us to mistakenly attribute healing to these therapies. In reality, the body may have healed on its own.\n6. These perceived successes are then shared as proof of alternative medicine’s effectiveness, even though the treatment may not have been responsible.\n7. Success stories get more attention than failures, which are rarely published. This creates a bias, as we are more likely to hear about positive outcomes, further spreading the idea that alternative therapies work when conventional medicine doesn’t.\nIf you’re reading this, you’re likely a health-conscious individual. Keep these points in mind when you hear about miraculous recoveries. For more insight, check out the documentaries *What The Health* and *Death by Medicine*.",

        "content": "•SIDE EFFECTS and ADRS, OF DRUGS•\nMost of us are aware of the concept of drug side effects, which can be either negative or positive. The goal of any drug manufacturer is to minimize negative side effects. If side effects are severe, a drug is unlikely to receive approval from regulatory authorities. Additionally, most side effects are evaluated over short time frames; therefore, effects that only become apparent after prolonged use—such as over decades—may go undetected. Drug manufacturers often aim to minimize the disclosure of side effects, revealing only those they cannot conceal or are legally required to disclose.\nIt’s important to recognize that all individuals are epigenetically different, so just as specific foods affect us in varied ways, specific drugs also have different effects on each person. This variability makes it difficult to identify all side effects during drug trials. It is not unreasonable to assume that there are certain side effects that your doctor may not be aware of. For example, it has long been known that many diabetic medications can increase the risk of heart disease. However, manufacturers of these medications are only required to demonstrate that their drugs lower blood glucose levels, not that they do not increase the risk of heart disease.\nI personally had to stop using Avandia after discovering its potential risks, and I switched to Actos, only to stop that as well for the same reason. This led me to change my diet and lifestyle.\nIf you are a diabetic, your doctor may be so concerned about your risk of heart disease that they recommend you take statins as a preventive measure. Interestingly, the reverse is also true: if you are a heart patient taking certain drugs, your likelihood of developing diabetes significantly increases.\nUnderstanding Side Effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)\nThe distinction between side effects and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is often misunderstood. A side effect refers to unintended effects of a drug that occur within the therapeutic range, usually an undesirable secondary effect in addition to the desired therapeutic outcome. Side effects can vary among individuals.\nAn adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as “a response to a medicinal product that is noxious and unintended.” It is estimated that between 3% and 7% of all hospitalizations are due to ADRs, which can occur at normal therapeutic doses. In contrast, drug overdoses represent a different issue entirely.\nThe leading cause of ADRs is multiple drug interactions. It is crucial for individuals taking several medications to check for potential adverse interactions. The situation becomes even more complex as individuals can respond differently to each drug. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. maintains a database of ADRs, which healthcare providers are required to report and is publicly accessible. Medscape also offers a drug interaction checker that can be useful. Of course, discontinuing medications altogether would eliminate this concern.",

        "content": "•NNT & NNH OF DRUGS•\nHaving explained the concepts of side effects and ADRs, let’s discuss how various drugs are evaluated in terms of their performance. Two critical criteria in drug evaluation are Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Number Needed to Heal (NNH).\nNumber Needed to Treat (NNT) refers to the number of patients a doctor or researcher needs to treat to prevent one additional adverse outcome, such as death. For instance, if a cancer drug reduces the mortality rate from 30% to 25%, the NNT is calculated as 1 divided by the reduction in mortality rate (0.30 - 0.25), resulting in an NNT of 20.\nNumber Needed to Harm (NNH) refers to the number of patients who need to be treated for one to experience a harmful side effect. For many drugs, the NNH is often lower than the NNT. For example, for statin drugs, the NNH for muscle pain is 21, meaning one in every 21 patients may experience muscle pain.\nA tutorial video linked below will help clarify the concepts of NNT and NNH, as well as illustrate how drug companies may legally misrepresent the benefits of their products through statistical jargon.\nTo illustrate, consider statin drugs. According to The NNT Group, the NNT for statins prescribed for five years to prevent heart disease in individuals without prior heart issues is 104. This means 104 people must take statins for five years to prevent one additional heart attack. Meanwhile, the NNH of 21 indicates that five out of those 104 patients will likely experience muscle loss.\nIt is alarming to note that when all causes of death from ADRs, adverse drug events (ADEs), medical procedures, and diagnostics are considered, medical care itself becomes a leading cause of death in America, surpassing heart disease and cancer.\nThe Statistics for Statin drugs is shown below as a verbatim quotation:\n“In Summary, for those who received statins:\nBenefits in NNT\nNo statistically significant mortality benefit\n1 in 217 avoided a nonfatal heart attack (myocardial infarction)\n1 in 313 avoided a nonfatal stroke\nHarms in NNH\n1 in 21 experienced pain from muscle damage\n1 in 204 developed diabetes mellitus”",

primary the control group and the primary the control group and the primary outcome is looking at the incidence of outcome is looking at the incidence of outcome is looking at the incidence of blood clots now let's let's say that of the clots now let's let's say that of the 500 patients in the clat strapon group 500 patients in the clat strapon group 500 patients in the clat strapon group 70 got a blood clot or 14% And of the 70 got a blood clot or 14% And of the 70 got a blood clot or 14% And of the 500 patients in the control group 150 500 patients in the control group 150 500 patients in the control group 150 people got a blood clot or 30% in order to calculate ARR you take 30% in order to calculate ARR you take 30% or the CER and subtract 14% or the 30% or the CER and subtract 14% or the 30% or the CER and subtract 14% or the eer which gives you 16% this result means that there is a 16% this result means that there is a 16% lower incidence of developing a blood lower incidence of developing a blood lower incidence of developing a blood clot in the group taking clat strapon clot in the group taking clat strapon clot in the group taking clat strapon versus the group taking the

this new medication for one blood clot to be new medication for one blood clot to be new medication for one blood clot to be prevented which is where nnt comes into prevented which is where nnt comes into prevented which is where nnt comes into play the nnt is the reciprocal of ARR so play the nnt is the reciprocal of ARR so play the nnt is the reciprocal of ARR so you would take one / it by 0.16 or 16% you would take one / it by 0.16 or 16% you would take one / it by 0.16 or 16% and get a result of 6.25 or 7 you should and get a result of 6.25 or 7 you should and get a result of 6.25 or 7 you

patients period let's say that 4% of patients taking clat strapon developed a taking clat strapon developed a taking clat strapon developed a hemorrhagic stroke and 3% of patients in hemorrhagic stroke and 3% of patients in hemorrhagic stroke and 3% of patients in the control grou group developed a the control grou group developed a the control grou group developed a hemorrhagic hemorrhagic hemorrhagic stroke you can also determine the number stroke you can also determine the number stroke you can also determine the number of patients needed to harm or the nnh by of patients needed to harm or the nnh by of patients needed to harm or the nnh by utilizing adverse event profiles in order to determine the nnh profiles in order to determine the nnh you first determine the absolute risk you first determine the absolute risk you first determine the absolute risk difference and then you take the difference and then you take the difference and then you take the reciprocal of the absolute risk ratio so reciprocal of the absolute risk ratio so reciprocal of the absolute risk ratio so the ARR is 4% minus 3% which gives you a the ARR is 4% minus 3% which gives you a the ARR is 4% minus 3% which gives you a result of 1 % nnh is 1 / % nnh is 1 / 0.01 or the 1% which gives you a result 0.01 or the 1% which gives you a result 0.01 or the 1% which gives you a result of 100 patients this means that you would need patients this means that you would need to treat 100 patients with clat strapon to treat 100 patients with clat strapon to treat 100 patients with clat strapon in a one-year period before you see one in a one-year period before you see one in a one-year period before you see one hemorrhagic stroke event based on the nnt and the nnh for event based on the nnt and the nnh for this particular medication you determine this particular medication you determine this particular medication you determine that it only takes seven patients to that it only takes seven patients to that it only takes seven patients to treat in order to prevent one blood treat in order to prevent one blood treat in order to prevent one blood clot and it would take treating 100 clot and it would take treating 100 clot and it would take treating 100 patients before you would see one patients before you would see one patients before you would see one hemorragic stroke therefore the

        "content": "•BIAS IN MEDICAL & NUTRITIONAL RESEARCH•\nWe often assume that conclusions about foods and medications from research studies are honest and accurate. Historically, most nutrition research was government-funded, with key organizations like the NIH in the U.S. and NIN in India. However, budget cuts in the 21st century have led to private industries, particularly food and Pharma, filling the funding gap. Medical and nutritional research can be categorized as follows:\n(1) Primary Research\nTraditionally funded by the NIH, it focuses on broad public benefits like laboratory studies and randomized trials. Projects like the Human Genome and Human Proteome are still NIH-funded. However, a decrease in government funding has made this research less common.\n(2) Applied Research\nApplied research uses science to prevent and treat diseases. While some still receive NIH funding, much is now backed by pharma, food, and the supplement industries. It can be divided into research supporting various foods, justifying supplements, or showing harm in certain foods or lifestyles.\n(3) Public Health Research\nThis aims to improve public health at a population level, ideally government-funded, though private industries are increasingly stepping in.\n(4) Clinical research\nFocused on testing medications, this research is primarily funded by pharmaceutical companies. Variability in how people respond to treatments (e.g., due to gut microbiomes) complicates results. For instance, if a drug helps 30% of participants in a placebo group and 70% in an experimental group, it’s deemed effective, leading to its prescription for all, even though 60% who either were not cured or cured only due to placebo effect, are still exposed to side effects without gaining any benefit.\n(5) Pharmacological Research\nThis field explores how chemicals interact with biological systems, playing a central role in pharmaceutical development. Some key points worth noting are:\n5.1 The goal is not necessarily to cure diseases, as doing so could conflict with the long-term profitability of pharmaceutical companies.\n5.2 Pharmaceutical companies often focus on managing health markers such as blood pressure, blood sugar, or cholesterol, which usually require increasing dosages over time.\n5.3 These companies emphasize early detection, claiming it saves lives. While this is true for certain conditions like cancer, for most lifestyle diseases, it often leads to starting medication earlier. Additionally, they lobby to lower the thresholds for starting treatment, as seen with medications for blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.\n5.4 Pharmaceutical companies promote tighter control of these markers, often suggesting higher or more frequent dosages. For example, increasing the dosage from two to three pills a day represents a 50% increase in business. This approach influenced the ACCORD study (2001-2009). However, the study backfired, as it showed increased mortality rates in the experimental group, leading to its early termination.\nBias in Research\nWhen we read research papers, we expect them to be honest and objective. However, various factors can distort this objectivity. Numerous studies have shown how research can be manipulated to favor the organization funding it. Some of these biases are summarized below.\n(1) Funding Bias\nIn the U.S., government funding for research has significantly declined over the past five decades. By 2021, private sources contributed $633 billion to research and development (R&D), while government funding amounted to just $76 billion. Private funding often comes with specific interests or conditions, and studies show that research funded by private sources rarely contradicts the interests of the sponsor. This can happen for several reasons:\n- Research may be designed to avoid negative outcomes. For example, using the Standard American Diet (SAD) as a control can make almost any alternative diet seem healthier by comparison.\n- In some cases, research design can obscure significant negative outcomes. For instance, one study asked college students to consume large amounts of white bread, and their health appeared to improve. However, concluding that white bread is healthy would be misleading, as the students had to reduce their intake of more harmful foods like eggs, sausages, and bacon.\n-Funders may cancel research midway if they realize the results will not favor them. To prevent this, a law was enacted requiring that research be registered with government authorities before it begins, ensuring it cannot be canceled midstream. However, this law is not always strictly enforced by bureaucrats who are hoping for a cozy consulting career upon retirement.\n- Before any research is published, a synopsis must be provided. Funders often manipulate this summary to downplay negative findings. A notable example is when Senator Bob Dole altered the language of George McGovern's 1977 dietary guidelines. Originally recommending reduced meat consumption, the guidelines were changed to encourage the consumption of lean meat. The two statements have entirely different implications.\n(2) Myth Bias\nMyths can skew researchers' judgment. For example, high protein intake was long recommended, despite evidence that excessive protein harms kidneys and liver. Similarly, the myth that plant protein is incomplete has been debunked, yet it persisted for years.\nThe dairy industry perpetuated the idea that milk is the best calcium source, even when evidence suggested it could contribute to osteoporosis.\n(3) Scholarly Pride Bias\nRespected experts may distort findings to defend earlier positions. An example is Dr. Ancel Keys, whose *Seven Countries Study* promoted low-fat diets by excluding data from 15 countries that contradicted his hypothesis.\n(4) Publication Bias\nPositive outcomes are more likely to be published, skewing perceptions. Negative results often face reluctance in publication, leading to a distorted understanding of certain therapies.\nFor example, if three studies find that egg white therapy cures second-stage breast cancer, all three studies will likely get published. However, if seven subsequent studies show it does not, only one or two may be published. Future researchers may then mistakenly conclude the therapy is effective, leading to further studies based on flawed premises.\n(5) Media Bias\nMedia prefers sensational stories, which can lead to biased reporting. The food and pharma industries, significant advertisers, influence the coverage, leading to overexposure of certain diet trends while scientifically sound approaches are underreported. For example, Dr. Atkins' high-protein, high-fat diet received more media coverage than Pritikin’s low-fat, high-carb approach, despite the latter being scientifically sounder. Sensational books like *Grain Brain* and *Wheat Belly* also received more coverage, influenced by powerful Food industry lobbies that support such narratives. Additionally, since the media relies heavily on advertising revenue from the food and pharmaceutical industries, they often hesitate to publish studies critical of these sectors.\n(6) Government Bias\nGovernment agencies often face conflicts of interest, as bureaucrats seek consulting jobs post-retirement, and elected officials raise funds from industries they regulate.\nThe public relies on Government agencies like the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that medical devices are safe.\nThere is an inherent conflict of interest within the drug and device approval process, as the FDA primarily depends on clinical trials conducted by the very companies that manufacture these products. Research findings are often ambiguous and open to debate. The FDA has, at times, approved drugs and devices despite objections from its own staff. This recently came to light on a device called MitraClip made by Abbott Labs to fix leaky heart valves that was approved by the FDA in 2013. Over 17,000 reports have been filed complaining about this device.\n(7) Other Conflicts of Interest\nPolitical, personal ambitions, and other conflicts can further complicate the research landscape.\nConclusion\nIt’s crucial to approach research with caution. Understanding potential biases, especially the source of funding, helps reveal the full story behind the findings. Always scrutinize before accepting conclusions.\n————————————\nEND OF POST\n————————————",

study so we learn a Mediterranean diet study so we learn from Jack kuzak at the San Antonio from Jack kuzak at the San Antonio from Jack kuzak at the San Antonio breast cancer Symposium breast cancer Symposium breast cancer Symposium 2014 that K oifen reduces the risk of 2014 that K oifen reduces the risk of 2014 that K oifen reduces the risk of breast cancer by 29% compared to Placebo breast cancer by 29% compared to Placebo breast cancer by 29% compared to Placebo for at risk women what we don't learn at for at risk women what we don't learn at for at risk women what we don't learn at the San Antonio breast cancer Symposium the San Antonio breast cancer Symposium the San Antonio breast cancer Symposium 2014 is that jauzac is on the payroll of 2014 is that jauzac is on the payroll of 2014 is that jauzac is on the payroll of astrazenica the company that makes astrazenica the company that makes astrazenica the company that makes tamoxifen be that as it may here's the tamoxifen be that as it may here's the tamoxifen be that as it may here's the study data showing that 7% of women study data showing that 7% of women study data showing that 7% of women taking tamoxifen had breast cancer while taking tamoxifen had breast cancer while taking tamoxifen had breast cancer while in the placebo group it was 99.8% so in the placebo group it was 99.8% so in the placebo group it was 99.8% so there's your 29% reduction in breast there's your 29% reduction in breast there's your 29% reduction in breast cancer well you know where this is going cancer well you know where this is

see the absolute benefit of tamoxifen versus the absolute benefit of tamoxifen versus the absolute benefit of tamoxifen versus placebo is about 2.8% which means in placebo is about 2.8% which means in placebo is about 2.8% which means in other words 97.2% saw no benefit to other words 97.2% saw no benefit to other words 97.2% saw no benefit to tamoxifen and of course there's side tamoxifen and of

        "content": "•Role of Government & Media•\nWe’ve discussed how wealthy industries like Food, Pharma, and Health Care influence the information we receive. Now, let’s examine the roles of Government and Media. By “government,” I mean both elected politicians and bureaucrats.\nPoliticians need funding to win elections every 4-5 years, and that money often comes from wealthy industries, so it’s natural for them to support industry interests. Lobbyists work closely with politicians’ staff to ensure this support is secured.\nMeanwhile, bureaucrats often seek well-paid positions post-retirement, and there are plenty of opportunities within the food and pharma industries to accommodate them. Consequently, many senior officials are willing to accommodate lobbyists’ requests. All they need is some science to justify their actions, which researchers—often industry-funded—readily provide.\nLet’s now consider educational institutions, where much of the research is conducted. Imagine you are applying for a Ph.D. program at a leading U.S. university and need financial assistance. This assistance might come from, say, a soft drink manufacturer eager to fund research showing that consuming sugary sodas in moderation can be part of a balanced diet. The company provides funding annually. By the end of the first year, if your research findings are negative, the project might be canceled, and funding cut. This situation encourages researchers to use careful language in reports and potentially manipulate data to achieve favorable outcomes.\nThe data isn’t falsified, but choosing specific words or omitting data can still lead to misleading conclusions. Once published in a medical journal, the research paper includes an abstract. Doctors often only read the abstract, so lobbyists work hard to influence the language used here. Professor J. P. Rivers of the Department of Human Nutrition, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, observed:\n“The dispassionate objectivity of scientists is a myth. No scientist is simply involved in the single-minded pursuit of truth; they are also engaged in the passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success.”\nRole of Media\nNow, let’s talk about the role of media and medical journals. Editors have various options for each issue and can select whichever articles they prefer.\nMost published media rely on advertising revenue for their income. The proceeds from magazine sales alone don’t even cover the cost of publication. The largest advertisers are often the big food and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, it is natural for publishers to avoid controversial content that might jeopardize their relationships with advertisers.\nAnother factor to consider is article reprints. For example, if you like an article in a magazine like TIME, you can purchase reprints for about $3–5 each. The cover page shows the magazine cover, but inside, only the article you requested is included.\nImagine you’re an editor, deciding which health articles to include in the next issue. A dairy industry lobbyist approaches you and suggests that if you publish an article supporting the health benefits of butter, he’ll order half a million reprints to distribute to doctors across the U.S. What would you choose as the editor? That order could bring in nearly a million dollars in extra revenue for the magazine, and if your compensation includes profit-sharing, it could result in a substantial bonus for you.\nIt’s important to understand that this scenario isn’t a conspiracy. No laws are broken, and there’s no bribery involved. However, the consumer ends up misled, and situations like this happen every day. Posted below as an example is the issue of TIME magazine zone I’m referring to.👇",

        "content": "WHO & SUGAR\nIn 1776, when the United States gained independence, Americans consumed about 4 pounds of sugar per person annually—about 5 grams daily. By 1850, this had increased to 20 pounds per person, and by 1994, it reached 120 pounds. Over the past half-century, the food industry has increasingly used sugar to sweeten foods and beverages, often substituting it with high-fructose corn syrup, which is cheaper and widely available in the U.S. When efforts are made to limit sugar use, the industry often responds with resistance and pressure to halt those initiatives. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, summarized this challenge:\n\"One of the biggest challenges facing health promotion worldwide is that efforts to prevent our top killers 'go against the business interests of Big Food, Big Soda, and Big Alcohol'\"\nPlease watch the YouTube video titled “Big Sugar Takes on the World Health Organization” to understand how, in 2003, the U.S. government—under pressure from the sugar lobby—threatened to stop funding the WHO unless they changed the language of their guidelines on sugar consumption.",

This was based on Liebig’s idea that protein was the source of muscular energy and the observation that protein consumption was higher in the more successful (i.e. affluent) social groups or nations than elsewhere.”\n“After the 1939-45 war dry skim milk became available in the USA as a “fortune by-product of a domestic surplus-product problem”. It was clearly more satisfactory in every respect to dump it in the developing countries than to have to burry it in the US, as was contemplated by the Department of Agriculture at one point.”\nIndia definitely got it’s share of this milk powder as I am myself witness to that. The program was called “Food for Peace” and later became known as USAID PL-480.\nA non profit eye hospital my father headed received it’s share of such aid. I mention this only to emphasize how mistaken the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was at the time and how it played a role in propagating the protein myth. 110 grams of protein is triple of what we now know to be the true requirement of protein. The following video by Dr. Greger puts it in an interesting perspective. It also highlights how scientists loose objectivity in their passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success. The subject I cover in great detail in the posts during fourth week of the course in the health groups.\nIn a paper written by Professor J. P. Rivers of Departmentof Human Nutrition, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he says:\n“The dispassionate objectivity of scientists is a myth. No scientist is simply involved in the single-minded pursuit of truth, he is also engaged in the passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success.”\nPlease watched the attached video and read the paper by J. P. W. Rivers. 👇\nThe Great Protein Fiasco\nhttps://youtu.be/7NW32vLq340\nhttps://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/proceedings-of-the-nutrition-society/article/profession-of-nutritionan-historical-perspective/8B6FEB2519C511F30D4295EBD5F51785",

        "content": "Pharma companies extracted USD 2 trillion from consumers in the name of cholesterol level treatment.\nWhat a shame on medical research fraud and authorities. Their incompetency costed USD 2 trillion to people those who were fit and healthy.\n*Cholesterol* is finally officially removed from Naughty List. The  US government has finally accepted that *cholesterol* is not a _nutrient of concern_. *doing a U-turn* on their warnings to us to stay away from high-cholesterol foods since the 1970s to avoid heart disease and clogged arteries.\nThis means full-fat dairy products, nuts, coconut oil have now been classified as *safe* and have been officially removed from the _nutrients of concern_ list.\nThe US Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for updating the guidelines every five years, stated in its findings for 2015: \"Previously, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that cholesterol intake be limited to no more than 300 mg/day.\n\"The 2015 DGAC will not bring forward this recommendation because available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum (blood) cholesterol, consistent with the AHA/ACC (American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology)\nThe Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee will, in response, no longer warn people against eating high-cholesterol foods and will instead focus on *sugar as the main substance of dietary concern*.\nUS cardiologist Dr Steven Nissen said: _It's the right decision_. _We got the dietary guidelines wrong. They've been wrong for decades_.\"\nWhen we eat more foods rich in this compound, our bodies make less. If we deprive ourselves of foods high in cholesterol  - our body revs up.\nThe Real Truth about Cholesterol. The majority of the cholesterol in you is produced by your liver. Your brain is primarily made up from cholesterol. It is essential for nerve cells to function.\nCholesterol is the basis for the creation of all the steroid hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, and corticosteroids.\n*High cholesterol in the body is a clear indication which shows the liver of the individual is in good health.*\nDr. George V. Mann M.D. associate director of the Framingham study for the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors states:\n_Saturated fats and cholesterol in the diet are not the cause of coronary heart disease. *That myth is the greatest deception of the century, perhaps of any century*_\n*Cholesterol is the biggest medical scam of all time*\nThere is no such thing as *bad Cholesterol*\nSo you can stop trying to change your Cholesterol level. Studies prove beyond a doubt, cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease and it won't stop a heart attack.\n*The majority of people that have heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels.*\nOUR BODY NEEDS 950 mg OF CHOLESTEROL FOR DAILY METABOLISM AND THE LIVER IS THE MAIN Producer. ONLY 15% OF CHOLESTEROL IS BEING DONATED BY THE FOOD WE EAT.\nIf the fat content is less in our food we eat, our liver\nGot to work more to maintain the level at 950 mg.\n*If the cholesterol level is high in our body, it shows the liver is working perfect.*\nExperts say that there is nothing like LDL or HDL.\n…………..\n….. *Cholesterol is not found to create block any where in human body*.\nPlease share the recent facts about CHOLESTEROL\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2015/02/10/feds-poised-to-withdraw-longstanding-warnings-about-dietary-cholesterol/?utm_term ji=.\n•Eggs & Cholesterol•\nThe above news article is from 2015 and many people have been sending it to me for comments so I decided to write this post. This is a testament to what I teach in my course wher I spend a full week covering the politics of health which explains:\n1. How over 94% of the research, being conducted today, is funded by the food industry. The findings from these research have a way of being complementary to the industry funding the research.\n2. The research does not have to prove a point; it only needs to create enough doubt.\n3. The media likes to create sensation to sell more news.\n4. There is a nexus of food, Pharma and health care industries and government and media, which helps propagate confusing information deliberately composed by the researchers so as not to offend other industries but achieve the goal.\n5. The charter of Food & Drug Administration is to help the industry and they are always eager to do that.\nThe egg industry had been hurt by the previous FDA guidelines on recommended daily allowance for cholesterol, because even half the egg exceeded those guidelines.\nAn upper limit of 199 for total cholesterol had fueled the growth of Statin drugs and made it a $15 billion market.\nEgg industry dare not disturb the Pharma business. So they funded research that showed that when you eat food rich in cholesterol your body makes less of it (something we have known all along). Ten of the eleven studies, used by the FDA were funded by the egg industry. FDA accepted this evidence and reversed their position on cholesterol, removing it as a nutrient of concern. However while doing so they dare not hurt the Pharma industry so they did not change the upper limit on cholesterol of 199 which should have been done. THIS IS HOW YOU EAT YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO.\nIn my posts on cholesterol I have always maintained that\n1. There is no causation between high cholesterol and heart disease, only association is there. To restrict cholesterol under 200 hundred is flawed.\n2. Statin drugs cause more harm than good. The numbers needed to avoid a non fatal heart attack (NNH) is 217 and to save a non fatal stroke is 313. But statin drugs harm many more people and numbers needed to harm (NNH) by muscle damage is only 21.\n3. Egg (and other animal foods)  is not harmful because it has cholesterol, it is harmful because it causes inflammation which is the leading cause of all cardio vascular diseases.\nI hope now you know the rest of the Story.",

I recommend it to everyone, especially diabetics.\nHere is my recipe for two servings:\n1. 4 tbsp steel-cut oats\n2. 2 tsp ground flaxseed\n3. 1 tsp chia seeds\n4. 1 tsp sesame seeds\n5. 2 or 3 dates\n6. 1 tbsp raisins\n7. 1/4 cup almond milk\n8. 5 walnuts\n9. 1/4 tsp ground cardamom (ilaychi)\n10. 1/2 tsp cinnamon\n11. 1/2 cup sliced banana, blueberries, mango, or any fruit of your choice\nInstructions:\nCombine the first 7 ingredients with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10–15 minutes. Once cooked, add the cardamom, cinnamon, walnuts, and fruits.\nThis breakfast is a great way to meet your daily needs for nuts, seeds, and omega-3s. It tastes delicious and, when paired with a glass of green juice and a bowl of fruit, it covers two additional food groups for the day.\n————————————-",

        "content": "••• EARLY DETECTION VS PREVENTION •••\nAnother area of concern is the strong emphasis in modern medicine—and especially on social media—on early detection of disease. We are constantly told to go for regular screenings to catch conditions like cancer early. Self-monitoring is also heavily promoted.\nBut here’s the irony: while early detection gets all the attention, prevention gets almost none. This is especially unfortunate because most lifestyle diseases—such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and some cancers—are entirely preventable through diet and lifestyle modifications. Yet, articles and campaigns promoting such prevention are rare.\nWhy? Because there is no money in prevention. It threatens the profits of:\n- the processed food and animal agriculture industries,\n- healthcare providers who benefit from treating chronic disease,\n- and the pharmaceutical industry that sells lifelong medications.\nEarly detection, on the surface, sounds like a good idea. But it implicitly accepts disease as inevitable. The far better approach is to prevent disease from arising in the first place. Unfortunately, if everyone started living healthier lives, many industries—processed food, animal products, hospitals, and drug companies—would take a financial hit.\nTo be clear, this doesn’t mean there’s an organized conspiracy. But it does raise an important question: Why is prevention being ignored?\nSome leaders in the medical field have spoken out. Dr. Neal Barnard, for instance, founded the organization “Doctors Against Irresponsible Medicine”, which promotes prevention through lifestyle medicine. The American Board of Internal Medicine has also launched a campaign called “Choosing Wisely”, encouraging patients and doctors to question unnecessary treatments and focus on evidence-based practices.\nConsumers need to be aware of this built-in bias. The system heavily favors early detection over prevention, not because it’s better for patients, but because it’s better for business.\nIt’s time we shift our focus from managing disease to eliminating its causes. True health comes not from pills or early tests, but from the daily choices we make around food, movement, and lifestyle.\n————————————-\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————-",

        "content": "UNNECESSARY TESTS\nI previously discussed that what is “normal” for one group of people may not be the same for another—especially when comparing non-vegetarians and vegans. For example, prescribing medication or supplements to a vegan simply because a blood parameter falls outside the normal range can be misguided. It’s essential to consider other factors in such cases.\nSimilarly, advising people to undergo numerous tests without cause is not prudent. Tests should be conducted only when there is reason to suspect something may be wrong and when a patient has reported symptoms.\nThis issue has been debated in the United States for some time. As a result of this debate a foundation was created by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) with the primary purpose of improving public health. The mission statement on their website is:\n“To advance the core values of medical professionalism as a force to improve the quality of health care.”\nPrograms supporting this work include the\n*Choosing Wisely®️ campaign,\n*“Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely Challenge”,\n*  “Putting Stewardship into Medical Education and Training” grant program.\nOf these, “Choosing Wisely” is of special interest to us. The goal of this campaign is to promote conversations between clinicians and patients by helping patients choose care that is:\n* Supported by evidence\n* Not duplicative of other tests or procedures already received\n* Free from harm\n* Truly necessary\nIt calls upon leading medical specialty societies and other organizations to identify tests or procedures commonly used in their field whose necessity should be questioned and discussed with patients. Doctors are often criticized for prescribing unneeded tests and procedures that harm more than they help and add to medical costs that could otherwise be avoided.\nSince the campaign was launched in 2012, more than 400 tests and procedures have been called into question by 70 medical specialty societies with more than half a million member doctors. “Millions of Americans are increasingly realizing that when it comes to health care, more is not necessarily better,” said Dr. Christine Cassel, president of the ABIM Foundation. “Through these lists of tests and procedures, we hope to encourage conversations between physicians and patients about what care they truly need.”\nTwelve medical tests and procedures are now being questioned worldwide as unnecessary and potentially cause some harmful results to patients are listed below.\n12 Medical Tests to Avoid\n1. Avoid Inducing Labor or having a C-Section Before 39 Weeks:\nDeliveries before 39 weeks are associated with increased risks of learning disabilities, respiratory issues, and other complications. While early delivery is sometimes necessary, the recommendation is clear: a mature fetal lung test alone, without other medical reasons, is not enough to justify delivery before 39 weeks.\n(American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist; American Academy of Family Physicians)\n2. Avoid Routine Annual Pap Tests:\nFor women at average risk, annual Pap tests (cervical cytology screenings) do not offer added benefits over less frequent screening. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)\n3. Avoid CT Scans To Evaluate Minor Head Injuries:\nAbout half of children who visit emergency departments for head injuries receive a CT scan, exposing them to radiation that can increase future cancer risk. These scans involve radiation levels approximately 100 times that of a standard chest X-ray. Observation should precede any decision about CT scanning. (American Academy of Pediatrics)\n4. Avoid Stress Tests Using Echocardiographic Images:\nFor asymptomatic individuals, stress echocardiography adds limited value in assessing cardiovascular risk and may not justify its use. (American Society of Echocardiography)\n5. Avoid Prescribing Type 2 Diabetes Medication To Achieve Tight Glycemic Control:\nFor older adults with Type 2 diabetes, there is no evidence that strict blood sugar control improves health outcomes. In fact, it may lead to higher mortality rates. (American Geriatrics Society)\n6. Avoid EEGs (electroencephalography) on Patients With Recurrent Headaches:\nRecurrent headaches affect up to 20% of people. However, EEGs provide no diagnostic advantage over a clinical evaluation, do not improve treatment outcomes, and add unnecessary costs. (American Academy of Neurology)\n7. Avoid Routinely Treating Acid Reflux:\nAnti-reflux medications, while common for adults with GERD, are not effective for reducing symptoms in infants and may even cause harm in certain cases. (Society of Hospital Medicine)\n8. Avoid Lipid Profile Tests:\nThe lipid profile test checks cholesterol and triglyceride levels.\nSeveral scientific papers have proven that people with high so-called “bad” LDL cholesterol live the longest and there is now a large number of findings that contradict the lipid hypothesis that cholesterol has to be lowered at all.\n9. Avoid Mammograms:\nMammograms and breast screening have had no impact on breast cancer deaths and have actually been found to increase breast cancer mortality. With toxic radiation, mammogram testing compresses sensitive breast tissue causing pain and possible tissue damage. To make matters worse, the false negative and false positive rates of mammography are a troubling 30% and 89% respectively. Another concern is that many breast cancers occur below the armpits; however, mammography completely misses this auxiliary region, viewing only the breast tissue compressed between two plates of glass. Considering these drawbacks, breast thermography should be given closer consideration. Thermography is a non-invasive and non-toxic technique which can detect abnormalities before the ons no et of a malignancy, and as early as ten years before being recognized by mammography. This makes it much safer and potentially life-saving health test for women who are unknowingly developing abnormalities, as it can take several years for a cancerous tumor to develop and be detected by a mammogram.\n10. Avoid PSA Testing:\nA PSA blood test looks for prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland. High levels are supposedly associated with prostate cancer. The problem is that the association isn’t always correct, and when it is, the prostate cancer isn’t necessarily deadly. Nearly 20 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, which sounds scary, but only about 3 percent of all men die from it. The PSA test usually leads to overdiagnosis — biopsies and treatment in which the side effects are impotence and incontinence. Moreover, there is some evidence which suggests that biopsies and treatment actually aggravate prostate cancer. During a needle biopsy, a tumor may need to be punctured several times to retrieve an amount of tissue that’s adequate enough to be screened. It is believed that this repeated penetration may spread cancer cells into the track formed by the needle, or by spilling cancerous cells directly into the bloodstream or lympathic system.\n11. Avoid Routine Colorectal Cancer Screening:\nColorectal cancer screening often results in unnecessary removal of benign polyps which are of no threat to patients and the risks of their treatment or removal far exceed any benefit. The evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer.\n12. Avoid Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA):\nThis technique developed in the 1980s that measures, among many things, bone mineral density. The scans can determine bone strength and signs of osteopenia, a possible precursor to osteoporosis. Limitations abound, though. Measurements vary from scan to scan of the same person, as well as from machine to machine. DEXA doesn’t capture the collagen-to-mineral ratio, which is more predictive of bone strength than just mineral density. And higher bone mineral density doesn’t necessarily mean stronger bones, for someone with more bone mass will have more minerals but could have weaker bones.\nThe ABIM initiative to reduce unnecessary testing is commendable, though it has received limited media coverage. Ideally, information on these recommendations would be displayed in clinic waiting rooms for patients to see.\nI encourage everyone to understand these recommendations and make informed decisions. While these tests may still be needed in certain situations, it is wise to discuss your options with your doctor or consider a second opinion before proceeding.\n————————————-\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————-",

        "content": "•••    MY STORY   •••\nToday, I’d like to share a personal story of how I became interested in healthy eating and lifestyle, the sources of information I rely on, and my approach to research.\nLike many people, I used to believe that my diet and lifestyle were healthy and that my chronic illnesses were largely due to genetics. My dad and his brothers all had heart issues, hypertension, and diabetes. Two of them passed away from heart attacks in their 40s and 50s. I didn’t smoke, and my alcohol intake was limited to a few margaritas on weekends. We were mostly vegetarian, only having meat or seafood when eating out or at gatherings. I drank a lot of milk and loved eggs, convinced they were good for me. My morning and evening tea was made mostly of milk, which I took pride in. In the summer, I enjoyed cold coffee, mango milkshakes, and Rooh Afza lassi. Most mornings, I had either fried eggs or avocado masala omelettes with parathas.\nAfter graduating from IITK in 1971, my BMI was 22.7. I was a weightlifter and bodybuilder, even winning third-place prizes in these categories. However, over the years, my BMI gradually increased to 30.4 by the age 62. At 47, I started medication for gout. At 50, I began BP medication, and by 51, I was on diabetes medication, starting with Metformin. Within three years\nAvandia, another diabetes medication, was added which was later replaced with Actos due to cardiac risks. Later, Actos was banned for similar reasons. At 54, I started thyroid medication, and by 58, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and advised to use a CPAP machine due to loud snoring. My snoring was so loud that nobody could share a room with me at night and my wife had to use ear plugs.\nOur meals were largely vegetarian but high in ghee. Growing up, our meals were divided into “Kachcha Khana” and “Pakka Khana.” Lunch typically consisted of daal, roti, subji, curd, and rice, while dinner included parathis, curried potatoes, other vegetables, and curd. In the evenings, we always had snacks with tea.\nIn March 2012, Swami Ishwarananda of Chinmaya Mission West, with whom I was closely involved, stayed overnight at our home and requested steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. We happily prepared it, and that became the first conscious change I made to my diet. To my surprise, I began losing 1.5 pounds a month without trying, likely due to other subtle changes I’d started making unconsciously. That’s the beauty of intentional change—it often leads to other positive habits.\nOn January 1, 2013, we decided to put to use the Christmas gifts from our daughters: an Apple TV and a Netflix subscription. The first documentary we watched was “Happy”, and soon after, we found “Forks Over Knives”. Since we were food lovers, we decided to watch it, and that sparked my interest in health documentaries. We watched “Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead” and immediately ordered an Angel juicer. We joined a farm cooperative that delivered fresh organic produce twice a week, went on a three-day juice fast, adopted a vegan diet, and cut down on oil and sugar. My wife, who loves cooking, started experimenting with oil-free recipes.\nSouth Indian dishes like idli and uttapam, as well as Gujarati snacks like dhokla, handwa, and muthia, became household favorites. Tadka in our meals was replaced with chaunka (reducing ghee from 45 grams to 9 grams). Oil-based salad dressings were swapped for balsamic vinegar or lemon-ginger-honey-mustard, and we developed new soup recipes. We also adopted a practice of drinking green juice before each meal.\nAt the time, I wasn’t aware of the benefits of intermittent or prolonged fasting—that came after the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology. Our weekend parties still included oil and sugar, but I started noticing immediate, visible weight loss, which others commented on. My doctors, however, were cautious and encouraged me to stay on my medications. Over the next few years, I gradually phased out my medications: BP medication within 6 months, gout medication in one year, and diabetes medication took two years because of consistently high fasting glucose levels. Eventually, I also stopped my thyroid medication. My confidencte grew as friends and family noticed my changes, and soon, many of them bought green juicers, too.\nIn September 2017, I formed my first WhatsApp group with my IITK ’71 batchmates. Milk and curd were the most controversial topics but, over time, some members also started following and noticed improvements. New groups formed, expanding our collective knowledge and experience.\nTo stay motivated, I started watching health documentaries and YouTube videos daily, learning from doctors and medical researchers. In 2015, I began attending Advanced Study weekend seminars organized by Dr. John McDougall in Santa Rosa, where I met experts like Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. Michael Greger and others all of whom were very helpful in answering questions. In 2016 I began experimenting with intermittent fasting, followed by prolonged fasting in 2019.\nBesides seminars, documentaries, and YouTube lectures, my primary sources of information are PubMed, books, and Google. PubMed has been invaluable for access to research on various health topics. Being retired, I had the time to dedicate 20-30 hours a week to this research, with a strong motivation to prove my doctors wrong—and I did. Now, I spend even more time on the subject.\nDifferent doctors in the plant-based, whole-foods (PBWF) movement have varying opinions. I had to choose among them and prioritize on my own. I drew heavily from my Indian cultural heritage. These decisions are mine alone and are reinforced by personal experiences and feedback from others who follow me.\nFor example, Dr. Jason Fung advocates a keto diet with intermittent fasting, while PBWF doctors strongly oppose keto. Dr. Greger and Dr. Campbell support eating nuts, while Dr. Esselstyn is against it, especially for patients with critical heart conditions. Dr. McDougall focuses on starch, while Dr. Joel Fuhrman emphasizes fruits and vegetables. True North Health Center doctors, like Dr. Goldhammer and Dr. Klaper, focus on fasting therapy, though they have not yet introduced dry fasting as recommended by Nobel laureates Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi (2016) and Dr. Tasuku Honjo (2018).\nI believe that by following these changes precisely and incorporating fasting, one can achieve similar results in much less time than I did. Many members of my health groups have reported success. I encourage everyone, especially those hesitant to begin, to make significant changes for just three weeks and see the results. You’ll feel better, and others will notice as well.  If you make only minor changes, the results will also be minor and if you are a skeptic you will not connect the two and fall back.\nMy Teachers: Doctors I Follow\nHere’s a partial list of doctors I’ve learned from, and I highly recommend watching their videos on YouTube:\n1. Dr. Collin Campbell\n2. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn\n3. Dr. John McDougall\n4. Dr. Michael Greger\n5. Dr. Dean Ornish\n6. Dr. Neil Bernard\n7. Dr. Janice Stanger\n8. Dr. Robert Lustig\n9. Dr. B.M.Hegde\n10. Dr. Satchin Panda\nThese doctors don’t always agree with each other 100%, but I align most closely with Dr. Colin Campbell, who was influenced by Dr. Gopalan of the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad. Recently, Dr. Hemalatha, the previous director of this institute, has agreed to join my Plant-Based Wellness (PBW) Foundation, for which I’m deeply grateful.\nIn 2021, I founded two NGOs by the name PBW Foundation in the U.S. and India. Last year, a company, PBW Foods Pvt. Ltd., was started that launched its first Experiential Center in Cyber City. All the promoters’ equity has been donated to the foundation, making it a 50% partner. Our aim is to provide healthy foods like fresh green juices, nut milks, yogurts, butters, naturally sweetened beverages, and whole grain and seed breads throughout India and, eventually, worldwide. The foundation offers free courses and lectures across India, the U.S., and other English-speaking countries. This year (2024) the number of students who have completed my course has surpassed 250,000 and virtual groups span over 50 cities worldwide. Thank you all for your participation.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "WHY WHOLE FOOD?\nLack of Fiber Question\nThe lack of fiber in refined sugar causes it to be absorbed rapidly in the intestines, overwhelming the liver. The liver converts the fructose portion into fat, leading to fatty liver (NAFLD), visceral fat, and insulin resistance by interfering with insulin signaling in muscle cells.\nTo explain this concept visually, I often show a short clip from Lucy in the Chocolate Factory (watch here).\nhttps://youtu.be/AnHiAWlrYQc?si=sMCMxEmYv-AvU-un\nIn the video, when chocolates arrive at a comfortable pace, Lucy wraps them neatly and sends them down the conveyor belt to the shipping department — everything works smoothly. But when the belt speeds up, chaos ensues: the chocolates end up in the wrong places — her mouth, her hat, and even her blouse!\nOur liver works in much the same way. When sugar enters the bloodstream slowly (as it does when we eat whole fruits, which contain fiber), the liver can manage it efficiently. But when sugar arrives too quickly — as in fruit juice or processed sweets — the liver becomes overwhelmed. Instead of packaging fructose into fat for safe storage in subcutaneous fat cells (under the skin), it diverts it to unhealthy destinations: liver fat, visceral fat, and intramyocellular fat (inside muscle cells). These misplaced fats cause a cascade of problems, including NAFLD, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.\nAll this can happen simply because someone chose apple juice instead of an apple.\nThe Question\nThis raises an intriguing question:\nIf refined sugar (devoid of fiber) can cause such damage, what about refined fats (like oils) and refined proteins (like meat, dairy, and eggs) — which are also devoid of fiber?\nThe Answer\nLet’s unpack this carefully.\nWhen we examine refined fats and refined proteins, the mechanisms differ from refined sugar — but the metabolic consequences are surprisingly similar. When these nutrients are consumed without the natural fiber, phytonutrients, and water found in whole plant foods, they too overload our metabolic systems.\n1. Refined Fats (Oils, Ghee, Butter, etc.)\nRefined fats are essentially pure triglycerides extracted from whole foods like nuts, seeds, or olives — stripped of fiber, antioxidants, and other protective compounds.\nKey consequences:\n•   Rapid absorption and extreme calorie density:\nOils are absorbed almost instantly and are the most calorie-dense foods on Earth (9 kcal/g). Even small amounts can create a large caloric surplus, promoting weight gain and visceral fat accumulation.\n•   Fat accumulation in liver and muscle:\nExcess dietary fat — especially saturated and omega-6–rich oils — infiltrates liver (hepatocytes) and muscle cells (myocytes), leading to hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and lipotoxicity.\n•   Insulin resistance:\nIntracellular fat disrupts insulin signaling, reducing glucose uptake and increasing blood sugar and insulin levels — the same end result seen with sugar overload.\n•   Inflammation:\nMany refined oils (corn, sunflower, safflower, etc.) are rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which promote inflammatory compounds that worsen insulin resistance and damage blood vessels.\nSo yes — refined fats can indeed lead to fatty liver, visceral obesity, and insulin resistance, just through fat overload instead of fructose overload.\n2. Refined Proteins (Meat, Eggs, Dairy)\nThough not “refined” in the industrial sense, animal-based foods are naturally devoid of fiber and phytonutrients, and often high in saturated fat and amino acids (like methionine and leucine) that alter metabolic pathways.\nKey consequences:\n•   Lack of fiber:\nWithout fiber, there’s no buffering of nutrient absorption, no support for gut microbes, and no binding of bile acids. This increases the metabolic burden on the liver and kidneys and promotes gut dysbiosis.\n•   Fatty liver and insulin resistance:\nAnimal proteins often come packaged with saturated fat, contributing directly to hepatic fat accumulation. High intake of certain amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids) activates the mTOR pathway, which interferes with insulin signaling and promotes insulin resistance.\n•   Increased visceral fat:\nChronic insulin resistance caused by animal-based diets drives hyperinsulinemia, which promotes fat storage, particularly around abdominal organs.\nEpidemiological studies consistently link high consumption of red and processed meats with NAFLD, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.\n3. The Unifying Concept: Fiber and Nutrient Synergy\nFiber is not just a bulking agent — it’s a metabolic protector.\nIt:\n•   Slows absorption of glucose, fats, and amino acids, preventing overload.\n•   Feeds gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids (like butyrate) that improve insulin sensitivity and protect the liver.\n•   Binds bile acids and fats, reducing lipid absorption and cholesterol levels.\nWhen fiber is missing — whether from refined sugar, refined fat, or animal protein — metabolic overload follows. The result is lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and ultimately insulin resistance.\nIn essence, fiber and phytonutrient synergy is nature’s way of ensuring that the body receives nutrients at a pace it can handle — just like Lucy wrapping chocolates at a steady, manageable speed. Remove the fiber, and metabolic chaos begins.\n—————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————",

        "content": "WHY WHOLE FOOD?\nAdditional Perspectives\nWhen we try to understand something that isn’t yet clear to us, it helps to view it from multiple perspectives. My post yesterday on “Why Whole Food” focused on how the presence of fiber slows the absorption of food in the small intestine, preventing many lifestyle diseases. Today, let’s explore a few other perspectives.\n(1) Time Available for Food Absorption\nAnother important factor is the amount of time food remains in the small intestine for absorption.\nWhole, fiber-rich foods move through the intestines more quickly, allowing less time for absorption. This has two important consequences:\n* Reduced calorie absorption: Fewer calories are absorbed into the body, helping maintain a healthy weight.\n* Enhanced gut health: More undigested food reaches the colon, providing nourishment for beneficial gut bacteria. These microbes flourish and, in turn, produce essential nutrients such as vitamins and short-chain fatty acids that strengthen immunity and overall health.\nA good example of this is resistant starch found in beans. Because it resists absorption in the small intestine, it leads to a lower glycemic spike during the meal itself — less glucose enters the bloodstream since less starch is absorbed. In addition, when this resistant starch reaches the colon, it feeds beneficial bacteria that further improve metabolic health, a phenomenon known as the second meal effect.\nLeaky Gut Syndrome\nWhen food is refined and stripped of fiber, it moves slowly through the intestines, allowing nearly all calories to be absorbed before reaching the colon. This leaves the gut bacteria starved. In response, they begin consuming the mucin layer that protects the intestinal lining, eventually damaging the epithelial barrier — a condition known as leaky gut.\nLeaky gut allows harmful substances to enter the bloodstream and is believed to be a root cause of many autoimmune diseases. Over 80 such conditions have been identified, including hypothyroidism, arthritis, and lupus — and the number continues to rise.\n(2) The Protective Skin of Plants\nThe outer skin of plant foods not only protects the plant itself but is also rich in phytochemicals and antioxidants that nourish our gut microbiome. When we consume refined foods that lack these protective layers, our gut microbes are deprived of vital nutrients — and consequently, our bodies are deprived of the many beneficial compounds those microbes produce.\nIt is estimated that our microbiome may generate up to half of the chemicals required for human health — a staggering reminder of how deeply we depend on these microbial partners.\nA Note of Humility\nMany senior nutrition scientists agree that our understanding of nutrition is still in its infancy — there is far more we don’t know than what we do. Recognizing this, we should act with humility and choose what nature has already perfected over millions of years: whole foods.\nForming the habit of eating whole, unprocessed foods is not difficult, especially when begun early in life. The habits children form when young often last a lifetime — and choosing whole foods is one of the most powerful habits we can pass on to the next generation.\n—————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————",

Being “healthier” is a relative concept—it only means it’s the lesser evil when compared to something worse. That doesn’t qualify it as beneficial or safe for regular consumption. Let’s look at the three examples mentioned above:\n1. Jaggery vs Refined Sugar\nJaggery is often marketed as a traditional, “natural” sweetener with supposed health benefits. Articles tout it as rich in minerals like iron and magnesium. But here’s the catch—they’re always comparing it to refined white sugar.\nSure, if your only two options are jaggery and refined sugar, jaggery is the slightly better choice. But that does not mean it is healthy. It’s still a concentrated form of sugar and will still spike your blood glucose, burden your liver, and contribute to insulin resistance.\nIf you’ve already managed to eliminate added sugars from your diet and are getting all the sugar you need from fruits and vegetables, please don’t go back and “reward” yourself by adding jaggery. That would be a step backward, not forward.\nWant something truly better? Eat sugarcane. It has fiber, water, and micronutrients. Much less damaging than jaggery—which is, in essence, boiled-down, dehydrated sugarcane juice minus all the good stuff.\n2. Red Wine vs Other Alcohols\nRed wine often gets glowing coverage in lifestyle magazines and health columns. The reason? It contains resveratrol, a plant compound with antioxidant properties that has shown some promise in lab studies.\nBut let’s be clear: that doesn’t make red wine a health food. It is still alcohol, a known toxin that damages the liver, increases cancer risk, and impairs brain function over time.\nSo why the good press? It’s all about context. The studies compare red wine to other alcoholic beverages. So, in that narrow context, red wine emerges as the least harmful. If you are absolutely forced to choose between red wine, white wine, and scotch (say, you’re kidnapped and only these three are on offer—no water, no tea, no coconut water), go with red wine. At least it brings along a few antioxidants for the ride.\nBut if you don’t already drink alcohol, please don’t start—not for the resveratrol, not for “heart health,” not for social status. Even the World Health Organization is crystal clear on this: no level of alcohol consumption is completely safe.\nWant resveratrol? Eat a handful of red grapes. Or better still, eat a bowl of berries, which are even richer in health-protective phytonutrients—without the alcohol, of course.\n3. Olive Oil vs Other Oils\nMany health-conscious Indians have now adopted extra virgin olive oil, believing it’s a “healthy fat.” The marketing works beautifully: words like “cold-pressed,” “extra virgin,” and even “Mediterranean diet” all paint olive oil as a miracle elixir.\nBut here’s the inconvenient truth: Olive oil is not healthy.\nIt’s just less harmful than things like butter, lard, or hydrogenated oils. No matter how many virgins are attached to its label, at the end of the day, it’s still a refined, concentrated fat—99.9% oil, stripped of all the fiber and phytonutrients found in whole olives.\nWorse still, it’s unsuited to Indian cooking.\nWe typically cook at high temperatures—think of our tadkas and deep frying—and olive oil breaks down and oxidizes quickly at those temperatures, especially extra virgin olive oil. The fumes and byproducts can be harmful.\nA better alternative for high-heat Indian cooking is mustard oil, which has a high smoke point and has traditionally been used in Indian kitchens. But again, only use it if you must. Eating whole mustard seeds in your food is far healthier than consuming mustard oil.\nBetter yet, explore oil-free cooking methods: steaming, dry roasting, sautéing in water or vegetable broth, and baking. You’ll retain the flavors, improve your health, and save money.\nIn Summary:\nWhen someone says “this food is healthy,” ask: Healthy compared to what?\nDon’t fall for the trap of relative health claims.\n•\tJaggery is healthier than sugar—but it’s not healthy.\n•\tRed wine is better than whisky—but it’s not good for you.\n•\tOlive oil is less harmful than butter—but it’s still a processed, empty-calorie fat.\nThe only foods that truly promote health are whole, unrefined, plant-based foods—fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices.\nAnd here’s the real rule of thumb:\nIf it grew on a plant, eat it.\nIf it was made in a plant, think twice.\n————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————",

        "content": "•Doctors’ Advice on Medications •\nIf you are taking medication for a lifestyle disease, ask yourself: Why am I expected to take this for the rest of my life? Doctors often prescribe medications quickly because that’s what they are taught in medical school. Once you’re on lifelong medication, you become a lifelong patient—needing refills, follow-ups, and continued medical supervision.\nIn India, many patients expect a prescription; if they leave a doctor’s clinic without one, they feel shortchanged. Deprescribing is rare. It isn’t in the interest of doctors or pharmaceutical companies to stop medications.\nHere are some observations:\n1. Symptom-Focused Approach\nMost doctors focus on reducing symptoms to “normal” ranges. The underlying causes often remain unaddressed or are oversimplified—usually blamed on overeating or lack of exercise.\n2. Prescription-Driven Practice\nDoctors prescribe medication because that’s what is expected of them professionally and legally. It’s part of the standard treatment protocols they are trained to follow.\n3. Lack of Nutrition Education\nDoctors rarely discuss diet or lifestyle because they receive little to no training in nutrition. With limited time per patient, medication is often the quickest solution.\n4. Medical Standards of Care\nDoctors must follow standard care protocols to protect their licenses. In countries like the U.S., deviations can lead to malpractice lawsuits. Different specializations have different governing bodies. For example, both endocrinologists and general practitioners treat diabetes, but they may follow conflicting standards.\n5. Governing Body Interests\nMedical organizations often act in the interest of their members. Guidelines that lower diagnostic thresholds—meaning more patients and more prescriptions—are adopted quickly. But when new evidence supports relaxing those thresholds, changes are slow.\nA case in point:\nIn 1996, the fasting glucose cutoff for diagnosing diabetes was lowered from 140 to 126 mg/dL—quickly embraced by medical bodies. But in 2018, when guidelines were relaxed to an HbA1C of up to 8.0, it wasn’t widely adopted. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends 7.0, while the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommends 6.5—leading to confusion.\nThis hesitation to reverse course is human nature. Once income increases, few willingly go back. A Hindi couplet from 400 years ago says:\nबढ़त-बढ़त सम्पति-सलिलु, मन-सरोजु बढ़ि जाइ।\nघटत-घटत फिरि न घटै, बरु समूल कुम्हिलाइ॥\n“As one’s wealth grows, so does the lotus of desire. But when the water (wealth) recedes, the lotus cannot shrink back—it withers entirely.”\n6. The Chronic Condition Mindset\nEven when symptoms improve, doctors often discourage stopping medications. They believe the underlying disease is chronic and incurable, and improvements are solely due to ongoing medication.\nTaking Charge of Your Health\nAs we explore various diseases in future blog posts, you will face these realities. Many people in my health group ask how to reduce or stop medications. It is inappropriate for me to provide individual medical advice. That’s a decision between you and your doctor.\nHowever, I aim to empower you with knowledge so you can have a more informed conversation with your physician. Adopting a plant-based whole food (PBWF) diet, intermittent fasting, and a physically active lifestyle can lead to measurable improvements—and possibly reduced reliance on medication.\nWhen & How to Reduce Medication\nOnce you consistently follow a PBWF diet, walk daily, and eat early dinners, you’ll likely notice better sleep and increased energy. Track your blood pressure, blood sugar, and other markers at home. If they fall below clinical thresholds, discuss reducing your medications with your doctor.\nBe aware: your doctor may not be familiar with the most recent guidelines (e.g., JNC-8 for blood pressure, ACP 2018 for diabetes). You may need to bring them up and explain your lifestyle changes. If your doctor is not open to adjusting medications, consider a second opinion.\nImportant: I am not a doctor and do not offer medical advice. Any change in medication must be done with your physician’s guidance.\nA Case Example: Dr. McDougall’s Approach\nDr. John McDougall, in his 10-day live-in program in Santa Rosa, California, stopped all medications on day one—for all participants. His reasoning: when patients switched to a PBWF diet, their markers improved rapidly, and continuing medication could cause harmful drops, especially in blood sugar for diabetic patients.\nThis illustrates why diabetic patients must reduce insulin and medications in coordination with their doctors when switching to a healthier lifestyle.\nGuiding Principles\n- Never stop medications without first changing your diet and lifestyle.\n- Always prioritize sustainable lifestyle improvements over quick fixes.\n- Regularly monitor your progress and keep your doctor informed.\n- Respect that some doctors may not believe in stopping lifelong medications—seek a second opinion if needed.\n- Understand that reducing medications safely depends on the severity of your condition and your consistency in following the new lifestyle.\nSome people reduce medications by half every month, while others do so more gradually. If new guidelines suggest you were never a candidate for medication in the first place, your doctor may agree to stop it immediately.\nFor instance, current recommendations are:\n- Blood Pressure: 140/90 for people under 60; 150/90 for those over 60\n- Diabetes: HbA1C up to 8.0 is now considered acceptable in many cases\nFinal Note\nRecent research shows that aggressively managing numbers (like glucose or BP) with medication can sometimes do more harm than good. This topic is discussed in my blog post, “Better Safe Than Sorry”, where I debunk common medical myths.\nThe key takeaway: Start with food, not pharmaceuticals. As your health improves, let the numbers guide the conversation—with your doctor. You deserve to know all your options.\n—————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n—————————————",

        "content": "•VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION: A Deeper Look\nI repeatedly try to emphasize a crucial point: our understanding of nutrition is still in its infancy. We’ve only scratched the surface. When it comes to how food and nutrients interact with the body, there is far more we don’t know than we do. That’s why humility is essential when discussing nutrition—especially with something as debated as vitamin D.\nDr. Robert Lustig of the University of California, San Francisco, shares a story from his first day at Cornell Medical School. During a welcome address, the Dean told incoming students: “Half of what we’re going to teach you over the next four years is wrong. The problem is—we don’t know which half.”\nThe ongoing debate over vitamin D in the medical community is a perfect example of this uncertainty, as you’ll see in this blog.\nThe Vitamin D Debate\nOne of the most common and hotly debated questions I’m asked is:\nShould we take vitamin D supplements?\nMany people today are diagnosed as “deficient” in vitamin D. For years, the recommended healthy range has been 30–50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). However, many experts—including my teacher, Dr. John McDougall—had questioned this range, suggesting that 20–40 ng/ml may be more than sufficient.\nBut this raises a deeper question that often goes unaddressed:\nAre people who are healthy because they have high vitamin D levels?\nOr do they have high vitamin D levels because they’re healthy and spend more time outdoors?\nIn other words: is vitamin D causally linked to good health, or is it merely associated with it?\nWhat COVID-19 Taught Us\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies found that people who experienced severe symptoms often had low vitamin D levels, while those with higher levels tended to do better. This seemed to support the idea that vitamin D was protective—but again, the same question arose:\nWere their outcomes better because of vitamin D?\nOr were those people already healthier due to more sun exposure and better lifestyle habits, with high vitamin D levels being just one reflection of that?\nThe Emerging Science: Beyond Vitamin D\nRecent research offers fascinating insights into the benefits of sunlight—many of which go well beyond vitamin D production.\n1.\tInfrared Light and Melatonin Production\nSunlight contains a full spectrum of wavelengths from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). When our skin is exposed to IR light, it stimulates melatonin production within every cell of the body—not just in the brain.\nThis melatonin acts as a powerful antioxidant, helping to reduce oxidative stress and protect mitochondrial function.\n2.\tUltraviolet Light and Vitamin D\nVitamin D is only synthesized when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, which are shorter in wavelength. These rays are strongest around midday. However, during early mornings and late evenings, UVB rays are weaker due to the angle of the sun, while IR rays remain relatively strong.\n3.\tSunlight and Blood Sugar Control\nOne study on patients with diabetes showed that post-meal blood sugar spikes were significantly lower when individuals were exposed to sunlight. This again points to broader benefits of sun exposure unrelated to vitamin D.\n4.\tSwedish Study on Sun Exposure and Mortality\nIn a remarkable 20-year study of 30,000 Swedish women, participants were grouped based on sun exposure: minimal, moderate, and high.\nThe findings were striking:\n- Women with the highest sun exposure had the lowest mortality rates from cancer, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular diseases.\n- Smokers in the high-sun group had the same mortality as non-smokers in the low-sun group.\nIn other words, lack of sun exposure was as dangerous as smoking.\n5.\tU.S. COVID Study and Geography\nData also showed that people living in southern U.S. states—where sun exposure is higher year-round—had lower COVID-19 mortality rates than those in northern states.\nRethinking “Deficiency”\nThese recent research highlight an important nuance:\nTime of day matters.\nIf someone gets regular morning or evening sun, they may benefit greatly from infrared exposure, which supports cellular health—but their vitamin D levels may still be low, simply because UVB rays are weak at those times.\nThis means a person could have low vitamin D levels on paper yet still be in excellent health. On the flip side, someone supplementing to maintain high vitamin D levels might assume they are healthy, when in fact they are missing out on the broader benefits of real sunlight.\nTo Conclude:\nSunlight is more important than vitamin D. Even 15–20 minutes of sun exposure at any time of day supports mitochondrial function and reduces the risk of major metabolic diseases—including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.\nFor optimal vitamin D production, mid-morning (about 2 hours after sunrise) to mid-afternoon (2 hours before sunset) is the best time to get direct sun.\nBut don’t fall into the trap of thinking that a normal vitamin D level—achieved through supplements—means you’re fine. It’s not just about the number on the lab report. It’s about the quality of your sun exposure and its far-reaching effects on your overall health.\n————————————\nEND OF POST\n————————————",

        "content": "•Food Science, Nutrition, and Metabolic Health•\nIn the 1920s, research on celiac disease experienced by sailors on long voyages led to the discovery of vitamin C. At the time, the conclusion was not that the real issue was a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, but rather a deficiency of a specific nutrient. This marked the beginning of what we now consider nutrition science.\nSimilarly, the development of antibiotics also in 1928 gave rise to modern health science, which often embraces the idea of “a pill for every ill.” These approaches served us well for decades. However, a growing number of doctors and nutritionists are beginning to recognize that we may have made some critical errors in our understanding.\nDr. Colin Campbell, the number one nutritionist in the world, for example, has spoken out against the reductionist view of nutrition—where the focus is placed on individual nutrients rather than the complex interactions among them in whole plant foods. Just because a nutrient is isolated and supplemented doesn’t mean the body will absorb and utilize it effectively.\nThe emerging field of epigenetics has further challenged traditional views. It has shown us that bacteria are not necessarily our enemies—in fact, they are essential partners, producing many of the chemicals our bodies need. Every plant food has its own unique bacterial profile, which helps colonize our gut. Our immunity and overall health are deeply tied to the well-being of this internal ecosystem. Antibiotics, while sometimes necessary, can harm this microbial balance and have long-term consequences.\nWe seem to have come full circle, realizing that some of what we once thought was harmful may not be, and vice versa. Paradigms are shifting, and many of the lessons from the past century must be reconsidered.\nNew Insights\nNew insights continue to reshape our understanding. For example, the Nobel Prizes awarded in 2016, 2017, and 2018 highlighted groundbreaking discoveries in areas such as autophagy and circadian biology. These findings show that the absence of food—and the timing of food intake—can be just as important as the food itself. This has profound implications for how we approach diet and lifestyle choices today.\nFood Science, Nutrition & Metabolic Health\nFood science, nutrition, and metabolic health are three distinct fields that are often misunderstood or used interchangeably. Here’s what each actually means:\n* Food Science deals with what happens to food from the time it’s grown until it reaches your mouth—processing, storage, preservation, and preparation.\n* Nutrition concerns what happens to food after it enters your mouth—how it’s digested, absorbed, and transported to your cells.\n* Metabolic Health focuses on what happens to food inside your cells—how it’s used to produce energy and support cellular function.\nThe Real Problem: Metabolic Dysfunction\nMany chronic diseases—such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, cancer, dementia, and PCOS—stem from metabolic dysfunction at the cellular level. These conditions account for nearly 75% of the entire U.S. healthcare budget. Despite this, our current medical approach largely focuses on symptom management rather than root-cause resolution. Here are some examples.\n1.\tHeart Disease:\nWe use statins to lower LDL cholesterol, but LDL is not the root problem—it’s a symptom or marker of an underlying issue. That’s why using statins for primary prevention doesn’t significantly extend lifespan: we’re not fixing the real problem.\n2.\tHypertension:\nWe treat high blood pressure with medications, but we’re not addressing endothelial dysfunction—the underlying issue that leads to kidney failure, heart failure, and more. Lowering blood pressure helps, but it’s a temporary patch, not a cure.\n3.\tHigh Blood Glucose:\nWe prescribe drugs to reduce blood sugar, but we’re not correcting insulin resistance or pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, which are the actual causes. Again, lowering blood glucose isn’t bad, but it doesn’t fix the metabolic defects that led to it in the first place. We’re managing symptoms while ignoring the disease mechanism.\nFor the past seven decades, this symptom-based approach hasn’t solved the problem. It’s time to shift our mindset and focus on the root cause—mitochondrial dysfunction.\nThe Role of Mitochondria\nMitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, generating ATP—the chemical energy our bodies depend on. Without ATP, cells cannot function. When mitochondria fail, cells must shift to a less efficient energy system: fermentation instead of oxidation.\nFor example, cancer cells can survive without oxygen by relying heavily on glucose. Why? Because their mitochondria are damaged or entirely nonfunctional. This mitochondrial dysfunction is at the core of many metabolic diseases.\nRethinking Our Belief Systems\nMuch like religion, nutrition has long been treated as a matter of dogma. People change their religion usually because their current beliefs no longer serve them. The same is happening in nutrition.\nPeople are questioning outdated ideas. For decades, we’ve used a reductionist approach to food, focusing on isolated nutrients and calorie counting. But this has failed to improve public health. Experts like Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Robert Lustig have worked to challenge and dismantle these flawed beliefs. Dr. Campbell teaches that we should think of food as a whole, not just as a sum of its nutrient parts. Every food contains a unique “symphony” of nutrients that work together in ways we’re only beginning to understand.\n————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n————————————",

        "content": "•• BREAKFAST OR NOT? ••\nTechnically speaking, breakfast is simply the first meal of the day, no matter when you eat it. Whether it’s 7 a.m., noon, or 3 p.m.—whenever you break your overnight fast, that is your “break-fast.”\nHowever, in common usage, breakfast is almost always associated with the early morning—a meal eaten shortly after waking up. This association is relatively modern in the sweep of human history.\nA Brief History of “Breakfast”\nThe word breakfast appeared in written English during the 15th century, referring literally to the act of “breaking the fast” from the night before. In Old English, people used the word morgenmete, which simply meant “morning meal.”\nThroughout much of human history, meals were shaped by necessity, not routine. People often ate one or two meals a day depending on their lifestyle, work, or availability of food. Regular morning meals were not always standard practice.\nIn fact, in many traditional cultures, people began their day with work or activity and did not eat immediately upon waking. Even today, in many parts of rural India or Africa, breakfast as we know it is minimal or delayed.\nThe Birth of the Modern “Breakfast”\nThe cultural and commercial rise of the modern breakfast owes much to one man: Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a physician, health reformer, and Seventh-day Adventist who ran the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan in the late 1800s.\nKellogg was obsessed with digestive health and bowel regularity. He was a strong proponent of bland, fiber-rich, meatless diets and believed that spicy or rich foods (as well as masturbation) led to poor health. He promoted enemas, hydrotherapy, and vegetarianism as tools for maintaining internal purity.\nIn his quest to develop a healthy, palatable food for his patients, he invented Corn Flakes, along with his brother, Will Keith Kellogg. Originally, the flakes were entirely plain and unsweetened—intended as a bland, wholesome food to calm the passions and nourish the gut.\nWill Kellogg, however, saw commercial potential in this invention. He eventually added sugar to the flakes and began mass marketing them as a ready-to-eat breakfast cereal. The Kellogg Company was born, and with it began the commercialization of breakfast on a massive scale.\nTo help promote cereal, the idea that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” was popularized. The phrase first appeared in Good Health magazine in 1917, written by Lenna F. Cooper, a nurse and dietitian trained under Dr. Kellogg. This slogan became a marketing hook—one that stuck, thanks to decades of advertising.\nThe Processed Food Industry Takes Over\nToday, breakfast cereals are a multi-billion dollar industry. Aisles in grocery stores are lined with boxes claiming health benefits, energy boosts, or vitamin enrichment. Many of these cereals are loaded with sugar, preservatives, artificial flavors, and refined grains—a far cry from Kellogg’s original idea of health.\nDespite these nutritional drawbacks, the belief that breakfast is essential—especially cereal-based breakfast—remains deeply embedded in modern culture. But science is beginning to challenge this long-standing assumption.\nRethinking Breakfast in Light of Modern Science\nRecent studies suggest that breakfast is not necessarily the most important meal of the day—especially not for everyone.\nIn fact, for individuals suffering from chronic metabolic conditions—such as:\n•\tType 2 diabetes\n•\tHypertension\n•\tObesity\n•\tFatty liver\n•\tMetabolic syndrome\n—skipping or delaying breakfast may actually be beneficial.\nWhy? Because the human body is not designed to be in a constant fed state. When we eat frequently and start early, we don’t allow the body time to repair, recycle, or switch metabolic gears.\nIntermittent Fasting: The Metabolic Shift\nThe concept of intermittent fasting (IF) has gained scientific traction in recent years. One of the most common and effective patterns is the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window.\nThis method works with the body’s natural rhythm. Here’s how:\n•\tThe liver stores about 500 calories worth of glucose (glycogen), which is used up in roughly 10–12 hours after your last meal.\n•\tOnce glycogen is depleted, the body switches to burning fat for energy—entering a state called ketosis.\n•\tThis fat-burning phase reduces visceral fat, liver fat, and intramyocellular lipids (fat stored in muscle).\n•\tIt also triggers autophagy, a cellular clean-up process that helps prevent disease and promotes longevity. This process earned the 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine.\nSo, by delaying or skipping breakfast, we allow the body to transition from glucose burning to fat burning, giving our organs a much-needed metabolic break.\nBut What If You Do Eat Breakfast?\nIf your lifestyle or health condition doesn’t require fasting—or if you’re still easing into the practice—you can still make breakfast a nutritious and healing meal.\nHere’s an ideal approach to break-fast when you’re ready to eat:\n1.\tStart with a Green Juice or Smoothie\nMade from spinach, kale, green apples, amla, coriander, celery, cucumber, lemon, ginger etc. This provides chlorophyll, minerals, and enzymes.\n2.\tFollow with a Large Serving of Fruits\nFruits are rich in water, fiber, and natural sugars. They hydrate, cleanse the system, and provide quick energy without burdening digestion.\n3.\tFinish with a Whole Grain or Fermented Food\n•\tOatmeal is excellent—rich in soluble fiber, it helps lower LDL cholesterol and keeps you full longer.\n•\tIdly with chutney (not sambhar) is another great option. Idly is fermented and steamed; chutney can be made oil-free. Avoid sambhar if it contains oil, as that adds unnecessary fat and can promote inflammation.\nFinal Thoughts\nThe blanket statement that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” needs to be revisited in light of modern evidence. While breakfast might still be important for children, athletes, or those with special nutritional needs, it is not a universal rule—and certainly not a sacred one.\nIf you’re trying to reverse chronic illness, improve your metabolism, or lose excess fat, skipping or delaying breakfast and narrowing your eating window may be more effective than focusing on what you eat in the morning.\nLet’s unlearn the myths handed down by food marketing, and instead make decisions based on biology, history, and personal health goals. Whether you eat breakfast or not—eat consciously, not conventionally.\n——————————\nEND OF BLOG\n——————————",

        "content": "•Omega-3:ALA, DHA, EPA•\nThe human body is remarkably efficient at converting excess calories into fat. This mechanism evolved as a survival strategy—storing energy during times of abundance to sustain us during times of scarcity. Fat is found in all plant-based foods, and consuming just 10–15% of our daily calories from fat is more than sufficient for health.\nThere are three main types of fats:\n- Saturated Fats: Primarily found in animal products. Among plant sources, coconut and palm kernel oil are notable examples.\n- Monounsaturated Fats: Found in nuts, avocados, olives, and mustard seeds.\n- Polyunsaturated Fats: This group includes essential fats like omega-3 (found in dark leafy greens, walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds) and omega-6 (found in corn, sunflower, safflower, and cottonseed oils).\nOf all these fats, only two fatty acids are considered essential—meaning the body cannot produce them on its own and they must be obtained through food. These are omega-3 and omega-6. Other fats are not considered essential.\nOmega-3 fats exist in three forms:\n- ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) – Found in plant foods like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.\n- DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and\n- EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) – Found primarily in animal foods, especially fish.\nThe human body can convert ALA (from plant sources) into DHA and EPA, although this conversion rate is sometimes questioned. Based on certain studies, some experts suggest that the conversion may be inadequate, and therefore DHA/EPA supplements should be taken.\nHowever, I do not agree with this view—for the following reasons:\n- Evolutionary Logic: My core philosophy is grounded in the belief that the human body, shaped by millions of years of evolution, knows how to process natural, whole foods. If we simply eat whole, plant-based foods as intended by nature, the body can take care of itself. Supplements are often unnecessary—and potentially harmful. The only exception is Vitamin B12, which is no longer naturally available due to water chlorination and modern hygiene practices. Suggesting that the body cannot convert enough ALA into DHA and EPA contradicts this evolutionary logic.\n- Differing Expert Opinions: Even among leading voices in the plant-based, whole-food (PBWF) community, there are differences in opinion. In such cases, I choose to align with those whose views resonate with my experience and understanding. I personally discussed this issue with Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. John McDougall, both of whom advise against DHA/EPA supplementation. Dr. Campbell offered the following statement:\n“If I must answer the DHA question, I would only say that we can get plenty of that type of chemical from the consumption of the omega-3 fatty acids that are found in certain plants—certain nuts, flaxseed, etc. Indeed, it also is related to a dietary balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, and this balance can be readily met with a good-quality diet of wholesome vegetables, fruits, grains, and nuts.”\nFor further insight, I highly recommend reading the following article.\nConfessions of a Fish Killer\nhttps://www.drmcdougall.com/misc/2007nl/jun/confessions.htm",

        "content": "Concluding Remarks\nThis course has explored the five pillars of health and the forces that shape our understanding of it. The twelve-point guidelines shared here can help anyone live a healthy, disease-free life.\nEven health-conscious people can make poor choices when guided by misinformation. Modern medicine often suppresses symptoms rather than addressing root causes. Yet true healing begins with correcting diet and lifestyle. Hippocrates taught that food and daily habits form the foundation of health—a principle lost when medicine shifted toward drugs after the early 1900s.\nIndustrialization of food for profit replaced nourishment with convenience. As fiber disappeared and physical activity declined, lifestyle diseases emerged. These cannot be cured by medication; drugs may normalize numbers but leave the cause untouched. The health advice we receive is often influenced by industries that benefit from dependency on their products.\nCommon myths persist:\n•   High protein intake is essential.\n•   Dairy is required for strong bones.\n•   “Everything in moderation” is healthy.\n•   A calorie is a calorie, regardless of source.\n•   Chronic diseases are incurable.\nScience tells a different story. Most chronic illnesses result from poor diet and lifestyle—and when these are corrected, the body begins to heal. Symptoms are not enemies but messages from within, urging us to change. Suppressing them with medication is like silencing the messenger.\nThe body continually adjusts to unhealthy habits, and these compensations are often mistaken for disease. Medications that aim to “fix” biomarkers may disturb natural balance and give false comfort. Real recovery begins when we align with nature and allow the body to restore itself.\nReducing Medications\nAfter adopting a whole-food, plant-based diet, regular walking, and early dinners, most people see improved energy, sleep, and blood markers. Track your progress at home and, when numbers improve, consult your physician about gradually tapering medication. Always change your diet before reducing drugs, and never stop medication without guidance.\nUpdated guidelines recommend more moderate targets:\n•   Blood pressure below 140/90 for those under 60, and 150/90 for those over 60.\n•   HbA1C up to 8.0 for diabetics.\nIf your doctor is unaware of these updates or hesitant to adjust prescriptions, consider a second opinion. Medication for lifestyle diseases should never be lifelong if underlying causes are removed.\nReclaiming Our Health\nDuring the last century, materialism and profit-driven science distorted healthcare and nutrition. Medical education sidelined prevention and neglected nutrition training. Food science, focused on taste and shelf life, stripped fiber and nutrients from our meals. The result has been damaged microbiomes and epidemics of metabolic and inflammatory disease.\nReductionist science treated nutrients in isolation instead of understanding food as a whole. Medicine, built around symptom suppression, joined hands with industries that profit when people stay sick. Drugs that mask symptoms often work against the body’s natural healing, accelerating decline.\nTo reclaim our health, we must move from managing disease to eliminating its causes. That means choosing whole, unprocessed plant foods, restoring fiber, staying active, sleeping early, and respecting the body’s innate intelligence. This course was created to bring these truths to light and offer a path to sustainable well-being.\nConcluding Reflections\nScience is an ever-evolving quest filled with what I call Not Yet Knowns (NYKnowns). Our grandchildren will know far more than we do—perhaps even laugh at the idea that medicine was once used to treat illness.\nThrough my own recovery and guiding thousands of others, I’ve learned that the solutions are few and simple. The same diet and lifestyle that prevent one chronic disease prevent them all. The American Gut Project confirmed that eating a wide variety of plant foods builds a diverse microbiome and stronger immunity. The same likely applies to our lungs and skin—diversity in diet and environment builds resilience.\nOur bodies are complex, but the principles of health are simple. Even sunlight—once valued only for vitamin D—is now known to generate melatonin within cells and promote deeper healing. What once seemed a “cause” may simply be a marker of good health.\nThough this is the final post of this course, I hope it marks a new beginning for you. The next part covered in the Advanced Course will focus on specific lifestyle diseases and their connection to diet and daily habits. My wish is that you carry this knowledge forward—to apply it, to share it, and to help create a world where health is our natural state.\nI end with lines I first spoke as a nine-year-old in a school play—words that have guided me for life:\n“Of all the doctors in this town,\nNo one has such high renown,\nAs Doctors Sunshine, Rest, Good Food,\nAnd Dr. Fresh Air too is good.”\nLet these be your lifelong physicians.\n⸻——————-\nEND OF POST\n—————————-",
