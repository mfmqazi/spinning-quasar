00:00:17.250 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪ - THE AVERAGE AMERICAN NOW CARRIES 23 EXTRA POUNDS.
00:00:26.559 - HEART DISEASE AND STROKE WILL CLAIM THE LIVES OF 460,000 AMERICAN WOMEN.
00:00:31.631 - 69 GRAMS OF FAT. YOU COULD ACTUALLY SAVE 12 GRAMS OF THE FAT AND HALF THE CALORIES
00:00:37.003 IF YOU SIMPLY ATE AN ENTIRE STICK OF BUTTER. - WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION AND BONE DISEASES, OSTEOPOROSIS.
00:00:45.211 - PROSTATE CANCER IS NOW THE MOST COMMON CANCER IN AMERICAN MEN. - DOCTORS SAY WE REALLY NEED TO EAT LESS RED AND PROCESSED MEAT.
00:00:53.219 - AND ARTERIAL SCLEROSIS AND CANCER AND AUTOIMMUNE DISEASE. - WE HAVE UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT
00:00:58.358 OF TYPE 2 DIABETES IN OUR CHILDREN, AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE HYPERTENSION IN OUR CHILDREN IN GRAMMAR SCHOOL.
00:01:04.096 - IN CASE YOU'RE WONDERING, 2,120 CALORIES. - CLEARLY THE WESTERN DIET IS TAKING A TOLL.
00:01:11.538 THIS SHOULD SERVE AS A WAKE-UP CALL. WE HAVE A GROWING PROBLEM, AND THE ONES WHO ARE GROWING ARE US.
00:01:19.012 Narrator Lee Fulkerson: FOOD: IT'S CENTRAL TO OUR LIVES AND TRADITIONS. EVERY SPECIAL OCCASION SEEMS TO INVOLVE FOOD AND FEASTING.
00:01:27.587 BUT COULD SOME OF THESE SAME FOODS, INCLUDING SEVERAL THAT WE THINK ARE GOOD FOR OUR HEALTH, ALSO BE CAUSING MANY OF OUR MOST SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS?
00:01:36.162 INDEED, WE'RE FACING A MASSIVE HEALTH CRISIS. NO LESS THAN 40% OF AMERICANS TODAY ARE OBESE,
00:01:43.670 AND ABOUT HALF OF US ARE TAKING SOME FORM OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG. - THE BEST KNOWN STATIN DRUG, LIPITOR,
00:01:50.677 IS THE MOST PRESCRIBED DRUG EVER IN THE WORLD. - ALMOST ONE IN FIVE AMERICAN FOUR-YEAR-OLDS
00:01:56.716 ARE NOW CONSIDERED TO BE OBESE. - THOUGH MEXICAN-AMERICANS AND AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN
00:02:01.921 ARE STILL MORE LIKELY TO BE OVERWEIGHT. - THIS COULD BE THE FIRST GENERATION OF CHILDREN
00:02:07.260 IN THE UNITED STATES THAT LIVES LESS THAN ITS PARENTS. Fulkerson: WE SPEND $2.2 TRILLION A YEAR ON HEALTH CARE,
00:02:14.033 OVER FIVE TIMES MORE THAN THE DEFENSE BUDGET. IN FACT, WE PAY MORE PER PERSON FOR HEALTH CARE
00:02:20.740 THAN ANY INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, YET WE'RE SICKER THAN EVER.
00:02:25.879 - YOU SEE, THERE'S NO MONEY IN HEALTHY PEOPLE, AND THERE'S NO MONEY IN DEAD PEOPLE. THE MONEY IS IN THE MIDDLE: PEOPLE WHO ARE ALIVE, SORT OF,
00:02:33.486 BUT WITH ONE OR MORE CHRONIC CONDITIONS. - OBESITY, DIABETES, HEART DISEASE, HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE
00:02:39.592 ARE ALL DIET-RELATED HEALTH ISSUES THAT COST THIS COUNTRY MORE THAN $120 BILLION EACH YEAR.
00:02:49.068 Fulkerson: EVERY MINUTE, A PERSON IN THE U.S. IS KILLED BY HEART DISEASE.
00:02:54.140 1,500 PEOPLE A DAY DIE FROM CANCER. COMBINED, THESE TWO DISEASES KILL
00:02:59.579 OVER 1 MILLION AMERICANS EVERY YEAR. CASES OF DIABETES ARE SKYROCKETING,
00:03:05.885 PARTICULARLY AMONG OUR YOUNGER POPULATION. - DIABETES. - DIABETES. - LIFE-THREATENING DIABETES.
00:03:11.491 Fulkerson: ONE OUT OF THREE PEOPLE BORN IN THE U.S. TODAY WILL DEVELOP THIS CRIPPLING CONDITION DURING THEIR LIFETIME.
00:03:16.863 MILLIONS OF OTHERS SUFFER FROM A HOST OF DEGENERATIVE DISEASES. MILLIONS MORE OF US ARE SO STIMULATED BY SUGAR,
00:03:24.504 COFFEE, AND ENERGY DRINKS THAT WE'VE MASKED OUR CHRONIC FATIGUE. BUT COULD THERE BE A SINGLE SOLUTION
00:03:31.678 TO ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS? A SOLUTION SO COMPREHENSIVE, YET SO STRAIGHTFORWARD,
00:03:37.083 THAT IT'S MIND-BOGGLING THAT MORE OF US HAVEN'T TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY? - SOMEONE HAS TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT THE ANSWER
00:03:43.590 ISN'T ANOTHER PILL. THE ANSWER IS SPINACH. Fulkerson: A GROWING NUMBER OF RESEARCHERS CLAIM
00:03:49.996 THAT IF WE ELIMINATE, OR GREATLY REDUCE, REFINED, PROCESSED, AND ANIMAL-BASED FOODS,
00:03:55.802 WE CAN PREVENT AND, IN CERTAIN CASES, EVEN REVERSE SEVERAL OF OUR WORST DISEASES.
00:04:02.375 THEY SAY ALL WE NEED TO DO IS ADOPT A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET. IT SOUNDS ALMOST TOO SIMPLE TO BE TRUE.
00:04:21.894 Fulkerson: YOU MIGHT NOT EXPECT SOMEONE LIKE ME TO EXPLORE THE CONNECTION BETWEEN DIET AND DISEASE. ON MY WAY OVER, I DRANK THESE TWO RED BULLS.
00:04:31.671 I ALSO HAD A 12-OUNCE COKE AND ANOTHER HALF OF A 12-OUNCE COKE.
00:04:37.176 Fulkerson: I HAVEN'T ALWAYS LIVED THE HEALTHIEST LIFESTYLE. AND I'VE EATEN MORE THAN MY SHARE OF FAST FOOD.
00:04:43.383 BUT AS PART OF MY EFFORT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT THE LINK BETWEEN FOOD AND HEALTH, I VISITED TWO PHYSICIANS IN LOS ANGELES,
00:04:49.889 DR. MATT LEDERMAN AND DR. ALONA PULDE. - HI. - HOW YOU DOIN'? - LEE FULKERSON. - LEE, NICE TO MEET YOU.
00:04:55.628 - NICE TO MEET YOU TOO. - THIS IS DR. PULDE. - HI, DR. PULDE. PLEASURE TO MEET YOU TOO.
00:05:00.767 Fulkerson: BOTH ARE M.D.s. DR. LEDERMAN WAS TRAINED IN INTERNAL MEDICINE AND DR. PULDE IN FAMILY PRACTICE.
00:05:06.906 THEY INCORPORATE A WHOLE PLANT FOODS NUTRITION PLAN INTO THE TREATMENT OF THEIR PATIENTS.
00:05:11.911 - SO LET'S GET STARTED ON THAT, AND THEN WE'LL DO SOME TALKING. - 142/82. Fulkerson: I FOUND OUT A LOT MORE THAN I EXPECTED.
00:05:19.118 LIKE A LOT OF AMERICANS, I THOUGHT MY HEALTH WAS PRETTY GOOD. - LET ME SEE YOUR HANDS. Fulkerson: I HAD NO MAJOR DISEASES THAT I KNEW OF.
00:05:25.258 - HOLD THEM NORMAL. Fulkerson: BUT I HADN'T HAD A THOROUGH CHECK-UP IN A WHILE, SO I DECIDED TO GET ONE.
00:05:32.465 WHEN DR. LEDERMAN GAVE ME THE RESULTS, IT WAS A REAL WAKE-UP CALL. I GOTTA SAY I'M KINDA SHOCKED.
00:05:39.339 I'M REALLY WORRIED ABOUT MY BLOOD WORK NUMBERS. 240 AND 241 FOR MY CHOLESTEROL
00:05:46.346 IS WAY HIGHER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN. I GOT THIS SIX NUMBER. THAT, TO ME, IS THE MOST WORRYING NUMBER I GOT.
00:05:54.587 THE SIX NUMBER WAS THE RESULT OF SOMETHING CALLED A CRP TEST, WHICH MEASURES THE INFLAMMATION IN MY HEART AND BLOOD VESSELS.
00:06:01.761 THIS PUT ME IN THE HIGH-RISK CATEGORY FOR A HEART ATTACK. SO I COMMITTED TO A 12-WEEK NUTRITION PROGRAM
00:06:08.301 UNDER DR. LEDERMAN'S SUPERVISION. THE PLAN WAS TO TREAT MY HEALTH PROBLEMS
00:06:13.639 BY EATING A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET.
00:06:24.550 THE IDEA OF USING NUTRITION TO PROMOTE GOOD HEALTH IS NOTHING NEW. INDEED, HIPPOCRATES,
00:06:30.056 THE ANCIENT GREEK FATHER OF WESTERN MEDICINE, SAID, "LET FOOD BE THY MEDICINE," OVER 2,000 YEARS AGO.
00:06:38.030 YET IT WASN'T UNTIL MORE RECENTLY THAT THE SCIENCE BEHIND THIS OBSERVATION WAS SYSTEMATICALLY PROBED AND APPLIED.
00:06:45.405 TWO RESEARCHERS WHO'VE MADE GROUNDBREAKING CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS EFFORT ARE DR. COLIN CAMPBELL
00:06:51.411 AND DR. CALDWELL ESSELSTYN. BORN JUST A FEW MONTHS APART IN 1933 AND '34,
00:06:59.051 THEY EACH GREW UP ON FARMS. CAMPBELL'S CHILDHOOD FARM IS IN RURAL VIRGINIA,
00:07:06.893 WHERE HIS FAMILY RAISED DAIRY CATTLE AND MILKED COWS. MY DAD AND MOTHER MOVED HERE IN 1943
00:07:14.167 WHEN I WAS NINE YEARS OLD. AND DURING THAT TIME, WE HAD A DAIRY OF ABOUT SOMEWHERES BETWEEN 20 AND 30 COWS,
00:07:20.473 WHICH IN THOSE DAYS WAS A MODEST, MEDIUM-SIZED DAIRY. Fulkerson: AT THE TIME, MILK WAS BELIEVED TO BE
00:07:27.213 NATURE'S PERFECT FOOD. SO PERFECT, IN FACT, THAT THIS U.S. GOVERNMENT FILM
00:07:32.819 FROM THE EARLY 20TH CENTURY RECOMMENDED THAT INFANTS WHO HAVE JUST BEEN WEANED FROM THEIR MOTHER'S MILK SHOULD BE SWITCHED IMMEDIATELY TO COW'S MILK.
00:07:41.794 - THAT WAS THE EXCITEMENT OF DOING SOMETHING, PRODUCING NATURE'S PERFECT FOOD, IF YOU WILL.
00:07:47.133 Fulkerson: ESTABLISHED IN 1675, THE ESSELSTYN'S FARM IS IN UPSTATE NEW YORK.
00:07:53.272 ON THESE ROLLING HILLSIDES, THEY GRAZED BOTH BEEF AND DAIRY CATTLE.
00:07:58.911 THIS WAS SORT OF LIKE THE NERVE CENTER OF THE OPERATION IN A WAY? - MORE OR LESS, ABSOLUTELY. THIS IS SORT OF THE EPICENTER, AROUND THESE BARNS.
00:08:06.152 THIS IS THE WAY FARMING WAS DONE IN THAT ERA. - AND SO THIS IS SORT OF WHERE YOU LEARNED THE CRAFT-- - THE TRADE.
00:08:12.725 - THE TRADE OF FARMING. HOW OLD WERE YOU WHEN YOU MOVED HERE? - SEVEN. I DIDN'T START DRIVING THE TRACTOR
00:08:18.030 TILL I WAS EIGHT YEARS OLD. [laughing] - A LATE BLOOMER, RIGHT? - YEAH, EXACTLY.
00:08:23.803 BUT I ENJOYED IT, AND I REALLY GOT A GREAT KICK OUT OF DOING THE FARM WORK.
00:08:29.141 Fulkerson: ALTHOUGH THEY DIDN'T KNOW EACH OTHER YET, FARM LIFE HAD A DEEP AND LASTING INFLUENCE ON BOTH CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN.
00:08:36.515 - TO MAKE IT SUCCESSFUL, YOU HAD TO HAVE PERSISTENCE, STAYING POWER, AND TENACITY OF PURPOSE. - I GUESS IT'S IRONIC IN THE SENSE THAT WE'RE BOTH
00:08:42.889 NOW ADVOCATING NOT CONSUMING THE PRODUCTS THAT WE WERE BUSY ACTUALLY PRODUCING WITH OUR FAMILIES.
00:08:49.061 Fulkerson: DURING CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN'S LIFETIMES, THE AMERICAN DIET HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
00:08:55.768 NEAR THE BEGINNING OF THE 20TH CENTURY, AMERICANS EACH ATE ABOUT 120 POUNDS OF MEAT ANNUALLY.
00:09:02.008 BY 2007, THAT FIGURE HAD EXPLODED TO NO LESS THAN 222 POUNDS.
00:09:08.047 IN 1913, WE ATE ABOUT 40 POUNDS OF PROCESSED SUGAR EACH PER YEAR.
00:09:13.786 HOWEVER BY 1999, OUR CONSUMPTION OF ALL REFINED SWEETENERS HAD RISEN TO OVER 147 POUNDS.
00:09:21.193 IN 1909, AMERICANS CONSUMED AROUND 294 POUNDS OF DAIRY PRODUCTS APIECE.
00:09:27.500 BUT BY 2006, OUR YEARLY INTAKE OF DAIRY HAD MORE THAN DOUBLED TO 605 POUNDS.
00:09:34.941 BY THE EARLY 1950s, CAMPBELL WAS OFF TO COLLEGE AT PENN STATE WHILE ESSELSTYN WENT TO YALE.
00:09:41.514 AS PART OF YALE'S ROWING TEAM, ESSELSTYN WON AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL IN 1956.
00:09:47.186 DURING THIS SAME DECADE, THE PACE OF AMERICAN LIFE WAS ACCELERATING, EVEN WITH OUR FOOD.
00:09:54.427 THE LATE '50s WAS THE HEYDAY OF THE DRIVE-IN BURGER JOINT. THE SUPERMARKET WAS JUST BEGINNING TO THRIVE
00:10:00.032 IN THE NEWLY BUILT, POST-WORLD WAR II SUBURBS. THIS WAS WHEN THE SO-CALLED CONVENIENCE FOODS WERE BORN,
00:10:06.806 LIKE THE LEGENDARY FOIL-WRAPPED TV DINNER, NOT TO MENTION A HOST OF OTHER TASTY PROCESSED DELICACIES
00:10:13.312 DEVISED TO MAKE OUR LIVES EASIER AND BETTER. BY NOW, COLIN CAMPBELL
00:10:20.653 WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY, WHICH HAD ONE OF THE MOST PRESTIGIOUS NUTRITIONAL SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS IN THE COUNTRY.
00:10:27.860 HIS RESEARCH WAS ON ANIMAL NUTRITION AND BIOCHEMISTRY. - BUT IT WAS FOCUSED MORE ON FEEDING ANIMALS
00:10:34.900 FOR THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE MEAT, MILK, AND EGGS, PROTEIN CONTAINING. AND SO MY OWN RESEARCH WAS FOCUSED ON PROTEIN,
00:10:42.708 MAKING SURE WE GOT ENOUGH. IT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE THE VITAL NUTRIENT.
00:10:48.180 IT WAS ONE OF THE FIRST NUTRIENTS DISCOVERED AND WITHOUT PROTEIN, THE ANIMAL WOULD DIE,
00:10:54.854 SO IT WAS A LIFE FORCE. IN FACT, IN THE EVEN EARLY 1900s,
00:11:00.059 THERE WERE STATEMENTS MADE THAT THIS IS THE STUFF OF CIVILIZATION ITSELF.
00:11:05.765 Fulkerson: PROTEIN WAS ALSO NEARLY SYNONYMOUS WITH ANIMAL-BASED FOODS LIKE MEAT.
00:11:10.903 IT STILL IS TODAY ALL OVER AMERICA. - WHY DO YOU THINK MEAT IS IMPORTANT IN OUR DIET?
00:11:16.709 - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN. - PROTEIN.
00:11:22.815 - PROTEIN. - A LOT OF PROTEIN IN IT. - WE NEED PROTEIN, DON'T WE? YOU CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT PROTEIN.
00:11:29.188 - THE IDEA THAT PLANTS HAD PROTEIN ALSO DIDN'T COME INTO PLAY UNTIL MAYBE THE LATE 1800s, EARLY 1900s,
00:11:35.695 AND THEN IT STRUGGLED THROUGH THE YEARS. Fulkerson: NO MATTER WHAT SOURCE THE PROTEIN CAME FROM, IN THE LATE 1950s, MOST SCIENTISTS BELIEVED
00:11:43.169 THE WORLD NEEDED A LOT MORE OF IT. - WE HAD A LOT OF STARVING AND MALNOURISHED CHILDREN IN THE WORLD.
00:11:48.808 AND SO IN MY COMMUNITY, IN THE NUTRITION COMMUNITY, THERE WERE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHY SO.
00:11:54.780 YOU KNOW, WHAT COULD BE DONE? AND ONE OF THE PROMINENT THOUGHTS WAS TO MAKE SURE THEY GET ENOUGH PROTEIN.
00:12:00.286 I CERTAINLY WENT ALONG WITH THIS VIEW. Fulkerson: AT ABOUT THE SAME TIME, DR. CALDWELL ESSELSTYN WAS JUST BEGINNING
00:12:06.525 HIS MEDICAL CAREER AT THE WORLD FAMOUS CLEVELAND CLINIC IN CLEVELAND, OHIO. SURGERY SOON BECAME HIS SPECIALTY.
00:12:13.999 - THERE'S SOMETHING AWFULLY SATISFYING ABOUT IF YOU CAN REMOVE THE DISEASE. FOR INSTANCE, IF A PATIENT HAD GALLSTONES
00:12:19.972 YOU COULD REMOVE THEM. IF IT WAS A GASTRIC ULCER OR A STOMACH ULCER, YOU DIRECTLY COULD TAKE CARE OF THAT. IF IT'S A HERNIA, THE SAME THING.
00:12:27.246 Fulkerson: DURING THE 1960s, HEART DISEASE WAS ON THE RISE IN THE U.S. WHAT DOCTORS COMMONLY CALL "CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE"
00:12:35.254 IS USUALLY CAUSED BY A CONDITION OF THE ARTERIES THAT SUPPLY THE HEART WITH BLOOD. WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT OVER TIME,
00:12:42.128 A FATTY SUBSTANCE IN THE BLOODSTREAM CALLED CHOLESTEROL BUILDS UP IN THE CORONARY ARTERIES, RESTRICTING THE BLOOD FLOW TO THE HEART.
00:12:49.969 THIS CAN ULTIMATELY CAUSE SEVERAL PROBLEMS, FROM SEVERE CHEST PAIN, CALLED ANGINA,
00:12:55.274 TO HEART ATTACKS. CHOLESTEROL IS A NATURAL SUBSTANCE PRODUCED BY ALL ANIMALS, INCLUDING HUMANS,
00:13:02.982 AND IT'S AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF OUR CELLS' WALLS. BUT WHEN WE CONSUME DIETARY CHOLESTEROL,
00:13:09.088 WHICH IS ONLY FOUND IN ANIMAL FOODS LIKE MEAT, EGGS, AND DAIRY PRODUCTS, IT TENDS TO STAY IN THE BLOODSTREAM.
00:13:15.961 THIS SO-CALLED PLAQUE IS WHAT COLLECTS ON THE INSIDE OF OUR BLOOD VESSELS AND IS THE MAJOR CAUSE OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
00:13:24.603 IN THE LATE 1960s, A COLLEAGUE OF DR. ESSELSTYN'S AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC MADE A MAJOR BREAKTHROUGH
00:13:31.210 IN THE TREATMENT OF THIS CONDITION. IN FACT, ESSELSTYN SHARED SPACE WITH HIM IN THE CLINIC'S SURGICAL LOCKER ROOM.
00:13:37.716 HIS NAME WAS DR. RENE FAVALORO. - RENE REALLY SPARKLED IN THE OPERATING ROOM.
00:13:43.656 AND IN 1967, HE DID THIS FIRST BYPASS GRAFT AT THE CLINIC-- CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT.
00:13:50.563 Fulkerson: THIS REVOLUTIONARY NEW PROCEDURE WAS ACCOMPLISHED BY REMOVING A VEIN FROM THE PATIENT'S LEG,
00:13:55.568 THEN STITCHING IT ON THE HEART'S BLOCKED CORONARY ARTERY TO ALLOW THE BLOOD TO FLOW AROUND, OR BYPASS, THE BLOCKAGE.
00:14:03.175 TODAY, OVER 500,000 AMERICANS GO UNDER THE KNIFE ANNUALLY FOR HEART BYPASS SURGERY.
00:14:09.215 COSTING AROUND $100,000 APIECE, THESE OPERATIONS ALONE CONSTITUTE A STAGGERING TOTAL
00:14:15.588 OF NEARLY $50 BILLION.
00:14:23.562 JOEY AUCOIN LIVES IN TAMPA, FLORIDA, WHERE HE OWNS AND OPERATES A LANDSCAPING COMPANY.
00:14:29.969 I TELL EVERYBODY--THE JOKE WITH EVERYBODY WITH ME IS: I DON'T EAT TO LIVE, I LIVE TO EAT. AND I--MY WHOLE LIFE, I ATE WHATEVER I WANTED.
00:14:36.909 Fulkerson: IN 2004, DOCTORS DISCOVERED JOEY HAD A DANGEROUSLY HIGH CHOLESTEROL LEVEL OF 320
00:14:43.282 AND A HAZARDOUS BLOOD SUGAR LEVEL OF 480. THIS NOT ONLY MADE HIM A TYPE 2 DIABETIC,
00:14:49.822 BUT A PRIME CANDIDATE FOR A HEART ATTACK AND A STROKE. - THIS IS MY DAILY PILL REGIMENT.
00:14:56.829 UM, I GOT TWO PILLS I TAKE FOR MY DIABETES. THEN I GOT ONE FOR CHOLESTEROL, ONE FOR HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE,
00:15:04.103 AND THEN I TAKE BYETTA, WHICH IS AN INJECTABLE MEDICINE, EVERY MORNING BEFORE BREAKFAST AND EVERY NIGHT BEFORE DINNER.
00:15:12.077 AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN DOING FOR ALMOST FOUR YEARS NOW. AND I KNOW IT MAKES ME TIRED, AND I JUST-- I JUST DON'T FEEL NORMAL.
00:15:18.751 I ONLY SLEEP FOUR HOURS A NIGHT OR SO. I JUST HATE TAKIN' 'EM.
00:15:26.692 Fulkerson: IN THE MID 1960s, DR. CAMPBELL WAS IN THE PHILIPPINES, TRYING TO GET MORE PROTEIN
00:15:32.364 TO MILLIONS OF MALNOURISHED CHILDREN. TO KEEP COSTS DOWN, HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES DECIDED NOT TO USE ANIMAL-BASED PROTEIN.
00:15:40.506 THE PROGRAM WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW SUCCESS. BUT THEN, DR. CAMPBELL STUMBLED ONTO A PIECE OF INFORMATION
00:15:46.378 THAT WAS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. IT CENTERED ON THE MORE AFFLUENT FAMILIES IN THE PHILIPPINES,
00:15:51.650 WHO WERE EATING RELATIVELY HIGH AMOUNTS OF ANIMAL-BASED FOODS. - BUT AT THE SAME TIME, THEY WERE THE ONES
00:15:58.590 MOST LIKELY TO HAVE THE CHILDREN WHO WERE SUSCEPTIBLE TO GETTING LIVER CANCER. Fulkerson: THIS WAS VERY UNUSUAL,
00:16:04.496 SINCE LIVER CANCERS ARE MAINLY FOUND IN ADULTS. - BUT JUST THE MERE FACT THAT THEY OCCURRED IN CHILDREN
00:16:10.102 SAID, YOU KNOW, THERE'S SOMETHING HERE. THIS IS PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. Fulkerson: SHORTLY AFTERWARD, DR. CAMPBELL
00:16:15.908 CAME ACROSS A SCIENTIFIC PAPER PUBLISHED IN A LITTLE-KNOWN INDIAN MEDICAL JOURNAL. IT DETAILED WORK THAT HAD BEEN DONE
00:16:22.214 ON A POPULATION OF EXPERIMENTAL RATS THAT WERE FIRST EXPOSED TO A CARCINOGEN CALLED AFLATOXIN,
00:16:28.520 THEN FED A DIET OF CASEIN, THE MAIN PROTEIN FOUND IN MILK. - THEY WERE TESTING THE EFFECT OF PROTEIN
00:16:34.526 ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIVER CANCER. THEY USED TWO DIFFERENT LEVELS OF PROTEIN. THEY USED 20% OF TOTAL CALORIES,
00:16:41.633 AND THEN THEY USED A MUCH LOWER LEVEL, 5%. 20% TURNED ON CANCER, 5% TURNED IT OFF.
00:16:49.408 Fulkerson: THIS INDIAN PAPER, TOGETHER WITH WHAT DR. CAMPBELL HAD LEARNED ABOUT INCREASED LIVER CANCERS IN CHILDREN
00:16:54.780 EATING ANIMAL-BASED FOODS, COMBINED TO CREATE A DECISIVE MOMENT IN HIS WORK AND HIS LIFE.
00:17:01.620 - BECAUSE WE LEARNED THAT ANIMAL PROTEIN WAS REALLY GOOD IN TURNING ON CANCER.
00:17:10.029 Fulkerson: DURING THIS SAME TIME, THE WAY AMERICANS ATE WAS CHANGING, AGAIN. THE NUMBER OF FAST-FOOD FRANCHISES WAS EXPLODING,
00:17:17.502 AS MORE AND MORE OVERSCHEDULED AMERICANS BEGAN USING THEM AS A CONVENIENT WAY TO FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES.
00:17:24.242 WHILE THE FAST-FOOD REVOLUTION WAS SWEEPING THE NATION, THE RATE OF CANCER DEATHS IN AMERICA
00:17:29.481 WAS CONTINUING TO RISE. AS A RESULT, IN 1971, PRESIDENT RICHARD NIXON INITIATED A PROGRAM
00:17:36.889 THAT WAS DUBBED "THE WAR ON CANCER." - WE ARE HERE TODAY FOR THE PURPOSE OF SIGNING THE CANCER ACT OF 1971.
00:17:44.830 AND I HOPE THAT IN THE YEARS AHEAD THAT WE MAY LOOK BACK ON THIS DAY
00:17:50.903 AND THIS ACTION AS BEING THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ACTION TAKEN DURING THIS ADMINISTRATION.
00:17:56.708 Fulkerson: ON THE FRONT LINES OF THIS NEW WAR WAS CALDWELL ESSELSTYN. BY 1978, HE WAS CHAIRMAN OF THE BREAST CANCER TASK FORCE
00:18:04.750 AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC. YET HE SOON BEGAN TO DOUBT THE MEDICAL PROCEDURES HE WAS USING.
00:18:11.056 - NO MATTER HOW MANY OF THESE OPERATIONS I WAS DOING FOR WOMEN FOR BREAST CANCER, I WASN'T DOING ONE SINGLE THING
00:18:18.230 FOR THE NEXT UNSUSPECTING VICTIM. Fulkerson: SO DR. ESSELSTYN STARTED INVESTIGATING
00:18:24.436 THE GLOBAL STATISTICS ON BREAST CANCER. ONE OF THE FACTS HE DISCOVERED WAS THAT THE INCIDENCE OF BREAST CANCER IN KENYA
00:18:30.843 WAS FAR LOWER THAN IT WAS IN THE UNITED STATES. IN FACT, IN 1978, THE CHANCES OF A WOMAN
00:18:38.484 GETTING BREAST CANCER IN KENYA WERE 82 TIMES LOWER THAN IN THE U.S.
00:18:44.923 DR. ESSELSTYN WAS EVEN MORE SURPRISED BY THE NUMBERS HE DISCOVERED FOR SOME OTHER TYPES OF CANCER.
00:18:50.562 IN THE ENTIRE NATION OF JAPAN IN 1958, HOW MANY AUTOPSY-PROVEN DEATHS
00:18:56.502 WERE THERE FROM CANCER OF THE PROSTATE? 18.
00:19:02.908 18 IN THE ENTIRE NATION. THAT, TO ME, WAS ABOUT THE MOST MIND-BOGGLING PUBLIC HEALTH FIGURE THAT I THINK I'D EVER ENCOUNTERED.
00:19:11.517 Fulkerson: IN THE SAME YEAR, THE U.S. POPULATION WAS ONLY ABOUT TWICE THE SIZE OF JAPAN'S,
00:19:16.588 YET THE NUMBER OF PROSTATE CANCER DEATHS EXCEEDED 14,000.
00:19:21.860 DR. ESSELSTYN ALSO DISCOVERED THAT IN THE EARLY 1970s, THE RISK FOR HEART DISEASE IN RURAL CHINA
00:19:28.367 WAS 12 TIMES LOWER THAN IT WAS IN THE U.S. AND IN THE HIGHLANDS OF PAPUA NEW GUINEA,
00:19:33.972 HEART DISEASE WAS RARELY ENCOUNTERED. THE LINK HE NOTED BETWEEN ALL THE AREAS HE STUDIED WAS SIMPLE.
00:19:41.780 - VIRTUALLY, THE WESTERN DIET WAS NONEXISTENT. THEY HAD NO ANIMAL PRODUCTS. THEY HAD NO DAIRY, NO MEAT. Fulkerson: EVEN MORE COMPELLING TO ESSELSTYN
00:19:48.320 WAS SOME HISTORICAL DATA THAT HAD LONG BEEN OVERLOOKED. IN WORLD WAR II, THE GERMANS OCCUPIED NORWAY.
00:19:54.993 AMONG THE FIRST THINGS THEY DID WAS CONFISCATE ALL THE LIVESTOCK AND FARM ANIMALS TO PROVIDE SUPPLIES FOR THEIR OWN TROOPS.
00:20:02.634 SO THE NORWEGIANS WERE FORCED TO EAT MAINLY PLANT-BASED FOODS.
00:20:08.040 NOW WE LOOK AT THE DEATHS IN NORWAY, JUST ANTECEDENT TO THIS PERIOD, FROM HEART ATTACK AND STROKE.
00:20:14.980 1927, 1930, '35. LOOK AT RIGHT UP HERE.
00:20:20.452 RIGHT AT THE VERY TOP, 1939. BINGO! IN COME THE GERMANS.
00:20:26.525 IMMEDIATELY, 1940, WOW. '41, '42, '43, '44, '45.
00:20:32.464 HAVE WE EVER SEEN A POPULATION HAVE THEIR CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PLUMMET LIKE THIS FROM STATINS,
00:20:38.837 FROM BYPASS SURGERY, OR FROM STENTS? NO.
00:20:44.109 BUT LOOK WHAT IMMEDIATELY HAPPENED. WITH THE CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES IN 1945,
00:20:50.449 BACK COMES THE MEAT, BACK COMES THE DAIRY, BACK COMES THE STROKES AND HEART ATTACKS.
00:20:55.954 I MEAN, IT'S SUCH AN ABSOLUTE, POWERFUL LESSON. BUT, UH, WE DIDN'T GET IT.
00:21:02.628 Fulkerson: BECAUSE OF EVIDENCE LIKE THIS, DR. ESSELSTYN WAS MAKING THE SAME ASSESSMENT THAT DR. CAMPBELL WAS DUE TO HIS WORK IN THE PHILIPPINES,
00:21:10.802 SEEING A CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN ANIMAL-BASED FOODS AND SOME OF OUR MOST DEADLY DISEASES.
00:21:16.875 BUT THEY WEREN'T THE ONLY RESEARCHERS COMING TO THIS CONCLUSION. ANOTHER WAS DR. JOHN MCDOUGALL.
00:21:22.948 IN THE MID 1970s, HE BEGAN PRACTICING ON A SUGAR PLANTATION IN HAWAII.
00:21:28.253 - WHAT I OBSERVED THERE WAS THE HEALTH OF THE PEOPLE DIFFERED DRAMATICALLY DEPENDING UPON
00:21:34.526 HOW LONG THEY'D BEEN IN HAWAII. PEOPLE WHO WERE RAISED IN JAPAN, THE PHILIPPINES, KOREA, CHINA,
00:21:40.766 FIRST GENERATION WHO HAD MOVED FROM THEIR NATIVE LAND, WERE ALWAYS TRIM, NEVER HAD HEART DISEASE,
00:21:47.139 PROSTATE CANCER, COLON CANCER, BREAST CANCER, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS, NEVER OVERWEIGHT.
00:21:52.611 THEY WERE IN THEIR 80s AND 90s AND FULLY FUNCTIONAL. THEIR KIDS GOT A LITTLE FATTER, A LITTLE SICKER.
00:21:59.084 THEIR GRANDKIDS IN THE NEXT GENERATION WERE JUST AS FAT AND SICK AS ANYBODY I'D EVER SEEN.
00:22:04.156 AND WHAT CAME THROUGH CLEARLY WAS THE DIET WAS THE DIFFERENCE. THE FIRST GENERATION HAD LEARNED A DIET OF RICE AND VEGETABLES
00:22:09.828 IN THEIR NATIVE LAND. BUT THE KIDS, THEY STARTED TO GIVE UP THE RICE AND REPLACE IT WITH THE ANIMAL FOODS,
00:22:15.901 THE DAIRY PRODUCTS, THE MEATS, AND THE RESULTS WERE OBVIOUS. THEY GOT FAT AND SICK.
00:22:21.106 SO I KNEW AT THAT POINT WHAT CAUSED MOST DISEASES. Fulkerson: AT THE TIME, HOWEVER, CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN
00:22:28.413 KNEW VIRTUALLY NOTHING ABOUT THIS OTHER INFORMATION. EVEN SO, THEY ULTIMATELY REACHED A REVOLUTIONARY CONCLUSION--
00:22:35.153 THAT MANY OF OUR MOST CRIPPLING CONDITIONS COULD BE GREATLY REDUCED, IF NOT COMPLETELY ERADICATED,
00:22:41.626 SIMPLY BY EATING WHAT THEY CALL A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET. THIS MEANS CONSUMING FOODS THAT COME MAINLY
00:22:48.600 FROM WHOLE, MINIMALLY REFINED PLANTS SUCH AS FRUITS, VEGETABLES, GRAINS, AND LEGUMES.
00:22:55.707 IT ALSO MEANS AVOIDING ANIMAL-BASED FOODS SUCH AS MEAT, DAIRY, AND EGGS,
00:23:01.613 AS WELL AS PROCESSED FOODS LIKE BLEACHED FLOUR, REFINED SUGARS, AND OIL.
00:23:08.053 CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN'S RESEARCH IN THIS FIELD WOULD CHANGE THEIR LIVES FOREVER.
00:23:31.109 - SO, I WENT THROUGH YOUR PRELIMINARY FORM. THE GOALS THAT I HAVE-- TELL ME IF I MISSING ANY-- FROM YOU WERE: ELIMINATE YOUR SHOTS AND MEDICINES.
00:23:36.982 YOU WANT TO GET OFF THIS STUFF. YOU WANT TO SLEEP WELL AT NIGHT. YOU'RE NOT DOING THAT. YOU WANT TO STOP FEELING TIRED AND RUN DOWN.
00:23:42.220 YOU WANT TO LOSE WEIGHT. - THAT'S IT. YOU GOT IT. - SO THOSE ARE YOUR GOALS. THE OTHER COMPLAINTS: YOU HAD LOW ENERGY, RINGING IN THE EARS,
00:23:47.793 SINUS PROBLEMS, POST NASAL DRIP, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, WHEEZING, COUGHS, INDIGESTION, AND REFLUX, LOOSE STOOL, DIARRHEA, BLOATING,
00:23:54.666 BLACK AND BLOODY MUCOUSY STOOL WITH MEAT CONSUMPTION, AND DIFFICULTY WALKING, GETTING AROUND, TROUBLE LOSING WEIGHT, CHRONIC AND UNPLEASANT HUNGER FEELINGS,
00:24:02.441 GROGGY AFTER MEALS, STRONG FOOD CRAVINGS, AND ANXIETY ABOUT FOOD IN GENERAL. ALL OF THAT STUFF-- - SOUNDS LIKE I'M DEAD.
00:24:08.814 - [laughs] SO I DON'T MEAN TO, YOU KNOW, HARP ON THE BAD STUFF, BUT, YOU KNOW, THAT WILL ALL-- MOST OF THAT SHOULD GET BETTER.
00:24:16.621 MY GOALS, I'M ADDING IN. - WHICH GOALS DO YOU HAVE? - I WANT YOU TO REVERSE ALL YOUR MEDICAL DISEASES, THE ONES THAT WE CAN REVERSE,
00:24:23.128 AND MOST OF YOURS, WE COULD. I TOLD YOU ALL THE RISK AND BENEFITS. BASED ON WHAT I TOLD YOU, I WOULD STOP ALL THESE MEDS.
00:24:29.601 AND I WOULD STOP THESE, ON TOP OF ALL THESE RISKS. - OKAY, THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA TRY. YOU'RE GONNA GET MY BEST-- MY BEST EFFORT.
00:24:34.840 I CAN TELL YOU THAT. - YOU'LL DO GOOD. YOU'LL DO WELL.
00:24:40.145 Fulkerson: BY 1975, DR. CAMPBELL WAS AT CORNELL UNIVERSITY, INVESTIGATING WHAT HE'D DISCOVERED IN THE PHILIPPINES.
00:24:46.918 - OUR WORK FROM THE BEGINNING WAS DESIGNED, IN A SENSE, TO DO TWO MAIN THINGS. ONE, I WANTED TO REPLICATE, IF POSSIBLE, THE INDIAN WORK,
00:24:55.527 BECAUSE IT WAS SO PROVOCATIVE. SECONDLY, IF THIS WAS REALLY TRUE,
00:25:01.366 I WANTED TO STUDY HOW DOES IT WORK? Fulkerson: JUST LIKE THE INDIAN RESEARCHERS, CAMPBELL FED HALF THE RATS IN HIS STUDY
00:25:07.772 A DIET OF 20% CASEIN, THE MAIN PROTEIN IN DAIRY PRODUCTS. THE OTHER HALF WAS FED ONLY 5% CASEIN.
00:25:15.280 OVER THE 12 WEEKS OF THE STUDY, THE RATS EATING THE HIGHER PROTEIN DIET HAD A GREATLY ENHANCED LEVEL OF EARLY LIVER CANCER TUMOR GROWTH.
00:25:23.955 ON THE OTHER HAND, ALL OF THE RATS EATING ONLY 5% PROTEIN HAD NO EVIDENCE OF CANCER WHATSOEVER.
00:25:32.531 BUT DR. CAMPBELL DECIDED TO TAKE THESE FINDINGS A STEP FURTHER. THIS TIME, INSTEAD OF KEEPING HIS TEST RATS
00:25:38.737 ON THE SAME DIET THROUGHOUT THE STUDY, HE KEPT THEM IN ONE GROUP AND SWITCHED THEIR DIETS BACK AND FORTH
00:25:44.409 BETWEEN 5% AND 20% DAIRY PROTEIN, DOING SO AT THREE-WEEK INTERVALS.
00:25:50.315 THE RESULTS WERE ASTONISHING. WHENEVER THE RATS WERE FED 20% PROTEIN, EARLY LIVER TUMOR GROWTH EXPLODED.
00:25:58.256 BUT WHEN THE SAME RATS WERE GIVEN 5% PROTEIN, TUMOR GROWTH ACTUALLY WENT DOWN.
00:26:04.796 - I MEAN, THIS IS SO PROVOCATIVE, THIS INFORMATION. WE COULD TURN ON AND TURN OFF CANCER GROWTH
00:26:11.469 JUST BY ADJUSTING THE LEVEL OF INTAKE OF THAT PROTEIN. GOING FROM 5% TO 20%
00:26:17.208 IS WITHIN THE RANGE OF AMERICAN EXPERIENCE. THE TYPICAL STUDIES ON CHEMICAL CARCINOGENS CAUSING CANCER
00:26:23.315 ARE TESTING CHEMICALS AT LEVELS MAYBE THREE OR FOUR ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE HIGHER
00:26:28.653 THAN WE EXPERIENCE. Fulkerson: EVEN MORE SURPRISINGLY, DR. CAMPBELL DISCOVERED THAT A 20% DIET
00:26:34.659 OF PLANT PROTEINS FROM SOY BEANS AND WHEAT DID NOT PROMOTE CANCER. HOWEVER, THERE'S A LONGSTANDING BELIEF AMONG THE PUBLIC
00:26:42.100 THAT ANIMAL PROTEIN IS IMPORTANT FOR HUMAN HEALTH. CONNIE DIEKMAN SUPPORTS THIS POSITION.
00:26:50.442 MS. DIEKMAN IS DIRECTOR OF NUTRITION AT WASHINGTON UNIVERSITY IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI.
00:26:55.714 SHE'S THE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION, AND AN ADVISOR TO THE NATIONAL DAIRY COUNCIL.
00:27:02.687 - WHEN YOU ELIMINATE ANIMAL FOODS FROM YOUR EATING PLAN, YOU RUN THE RISK OF INADEQUATE PROTEIN CONTENT.
00:27:10.261 ANIMAL PROTEINS PROVIDE ALL THE AMINO ACIDS THAT WE NEED FOR CELL GROWTH,
00:27:16.801 TISSUE REPAIR, AND OVERALL HEALTH. - EATING WHOLE FOODS, IT'S VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE
00:27:22.741 TO BE PROTEIN DEFICIENT WITHOUT BEING CALORIE DEFICIENT. BECAUSE EVEN IF YOU TAKE THE FOODS
00:27:28.079 THAT HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF PROTEIN IN IT, LET'S SAY POTATOES, FOR EXAMPLE, OR RICE. YOU KNOW, 8%, 9%.
00:27:33.218 WELL, THAT'S THE FIGURE WE MORE OR LESS NEED. Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL'S RESEARCH LED HIM TO A CONCLUSION ABOUT THE WAY GENES, CHEMICALS,
00:27:40.158 AND NUTRITION INTERACT TO PROMOTE CANCER. - CANCER STARTS WITH GENES. IT MIGHT BE GENES WE'RE BORN WITH,
00:27:47.198 IT MIGHT BE GENES THAT ARE ACTUALLY CHANGED BY A CHEMICAL, SO THOSE GENES BECOME CAPABLE OF PRODUCING CANCER CELLS.
00:27:55.774 WHETHER WE DO OR DON'T GET CANCER IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HOW WE PROMOTE THOSE CANCER CELLS TO GROW OVER TIME.
00:28:04.149 THAT'S WHERE NUTRITION COMES INTO PLAY. THEY GROW MUCH MORE RAPIDLY WHEN THEY WERE FED ANIMAL PROTEIN.
00:28:11.589 Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL AND OTHER NUTRITIONAL SCIENTISTS HAVE FOUND THAT ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF CANCER CASES
00:28:16.594 ARE CAUSED SOLELY BY GENES. - I THINK THE GENERAL CONSENSUS IN MY FIELD
00:28:22.100 IS THAT PROBABLY NOT MORE THAN 1% OR 2% AT MOST IS ATTRIBUTED TO THE GENES WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE.
00:28:29.174 - AND THAT'S THE MOST HELPFUL AND HOPEFUL INFORMATION I GIVE PEOPLE. BECAUSE IF YOU GO THROUGH LIFE THINKING THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU
00:28:34.946 FROM A HEALTH PERSPECTIVE IS BASED ON YOUR GENES, YOU'RE A HELPLESS VICTIM. MY DIET WAS PRETTY ABOMINABLE.
00:28:40.285 I THOUGHT THE TWO PRINCIPAL FOOD GROUPS WERE CAFFEINE AND SUGAR. Fulkerson: DR. PAM POPPER IS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR
00:28:45.724 OF THE WELLNESS FORUM IN COLUMBUS, OHIO, AND AN EXPERT IN THE AREAS OF HEALTH AND NUTRITION.
00:28:51.396 THE WOMEN IN MY FAMILY ARE ALL OVERWEIGHT. I'M NOT. I DON'T EAT AND LIVE LIKE THEY DO, YOU KNOW.
00:28:57.435 SO, I'VE CHANGED MY HEALTH DESTINY BY NOT ENGAGING IN THE SAME HABITS. Fulkerson: OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS,
00:29:04.609 DR. CAMPBELL INITIATED MORE EXTENSIVE LAB STUDIES USING VARIOUS ANIMAL AND PLANT NUTRIENTS.
00:29:09.714 THE RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT: NUTRIENTS FROM ANIMAL FOODS PROMOTED CANCER GROWTH,
00:29:15.720 WHILE NUTRIENTS FROM PLANT FOODS DECREASED CANCER GROWTH. YET CAMPBELL HADN'T IDENTIFIED A SPECIFIC BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM
00:29:23.128 THAT CAUSED THE EFFECTS HE OBSERVED. - AND IT FINALLY OCCURRED TO ME THAT THERE IS NO SUCH THING AS THE MECHANISM.
00:29:30.502 WHAT WE ARE LOOKING AT WAS A SYMPHONY OF MECHANISMS. WE THINK THAT NUTRITION IS ATTRIBUTED
00:29:36.841 TO INDIVIDUAL NUTRIENTS. AND THAT'S THE WAY IT GETS MARKETED AND THAT'S THE WAY THE COMPANIES TELL US, SO FORTH. WHEN, IN FACT, NUTRITION,
00:29:43.915 ALL OF IT WORKING TOGETHER TO CREATE THIS SYMPHONY, THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF CHEMICALS IN FOOD,
00:29:49.487 ALL KIND OF WORKING TOGETHER NICELY. I MEAN, THE COMPLEXITY IS TOTAL. THAT'S A HOLISTIC CONCEPT.
00:29:55.326 AND I HAD TO SAY TO MYSELF, THAT'S A VERY EXCITING IDEA. Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL REALIZED
00:30:01.299 THAT HIS DISCOVERIES IN THE LABORATORY WERE SIGNIFICANT, BUT LIMITED. HOW WERE THESE FINDINGS RELEVANT IN PEOPLE?
00:30:07.806 HOW DO DIFFERENT TYPES OF FOODS AFFECT CANCER AND OTHER DISEASES? CAMPBELL NEEDED A LARGE-SCALE POPULATION STUDY.
00:30:18.349 HE WOULD SOON FIND A PERFECT OPPORTUNITY.
00:30:31.729 - SO MANGOES ARE REALLY GOOD. THEY FLAVOR THINGS REALLY NICELY. - OKAY. - THAT'S SOMETHING--
00:30:37.368 YOU WANNA GET A RIPER ONE. Fulkerson: DR. MATT LEDERMAN AND HIS WIFE, DR. ALONA PULDE,
00:30:42.707 ARE AMONG A SMALL BUT GROWING NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS WHO USE A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET
00:30:48.246 AS A PRIMARY TREATMENT FOR THEIR PATIENTS. FROM SHOPPING WITH PATIENTS TO TEACH THEM HOW TO READ NUTRITION LABELS...
00:30:54.452 - AND I DON'T CARE WHAT IT SAYS ON THE FRONT, THE BACK, OR THE SIDES-- both: LOOK AT THE INGREDIENTS. - AND THAT'S ALL I CARE ABOUT.
00:30:59.891 Fulkerson: TO SHOWING PATIENTS HOW TO PREPARE MEALS, THEY ARE NOT YOUR TYPICAL M.D.s.
00:31:05.463 DOCTORS LEDERMAN AND PULDE USE FOOD AS TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY FEEL IT'S THE BEST MEDICINE AVAILABLE--
00:31:11.336 MEDICINE THAT NOT ONLY MAKES THEIR PATIENTS FEEL BETTER BUT THAT TRULY IMPROVES THEIR HEALTH.
00:31:19.210 Fulkerson: IN 1973, THE U.S. CONGRESS PASSED A NEW FARM SUBSIDY BILL.
00:31:24.916 AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT INCLUDED INCENTIVES THAT ENCOURAGED A MASSIVE INCREASE IN CORN PRODUCTION.
00:31:31.489 ONE OF THE MAJOR BYPRODUCTS OF THIS ENORMOUS CORN SURPLUS WAS A LOW-COST SWEETENER CALLED "HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP".
00:31:39.030 COMPANIES COULD ADD THIS SWEETENER TO ANYTHING FROM SODA POP TO HOT DOGS, AND THEN MAKE THESE PRODUCTS WIDELY AVAILABLE AT LOW PRICES.
00:31:46.938 PROCESSED SUGARS AND OTHER REFINED FOODS ARE FAR MORE CALORIE-DENSE THAN THE WHOLE PLANTS THEY'RE MADE FROM.
00:31:52.944 THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN THEIR USE IS A MAJOR REASON WHY OUR FOOD HAS BECOME RICHER.
00:31:58.416 TO EVOLUTIONARY PSYCHOLOGIST AND AUTHOR DR. DOUG LISLE, THE CONSUMPTION OF UNNATURALLY DENSE FOODS
00:32:03.554 IS THE MAIN CAUSE FOR THE EPIDEMIC OF OBESITY IN AMERICA. IT ISN'T THAT PEOPLE HAVE BECOME MORE SELF-INDULGENT.
00:32:09.994 IT ISN'T BECAUSE THEY'RE LAZIER THAN THEY EVER WERE. WHAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT THEIR MECHANISMS OF SATIATION
00:32:15.967 ARE BEING FOOLED. Fulkerson: THE PROCESS STARTS WITH A RANGE OF RECEPTORS IN OUR STOMACHS THAT HELP US GAUGE HOW MUCH FOOD WE'VE EATEN.
00:32:22.774 THESE INCLUDE STRETCH RECEPTORS TO HELP MEASURE THE SHEER VOLUME OF FOOD IN OUR STOMACHS.
00:32:28.079 WE ALSO HAVE DENSITY RECEPTORS, TO HELP DETERMINE THE CALORIC DENSITY, OR WHAT WE MORE COMMONLY CALL THE RICHNESS OF OUR FOOD.
00:32:36.721 FOR INSTANCE, 500 CALORIES OF NATURAL PLANT FOOD FILLS THE STOMACH COMPLETELY,
00:32:41.960 TRIGGERING BOTH OUR STRETCH AND DENSITY RECEPTORS TO SIGNAL OUR BRAIN THAT WE'VE HAD ENOUGH TO EAT.
00:32:47.799 BUT 500 CALORIES OF UNNATURALLY RICH OR PROCESSED FOOD FILLS THE STOMACH FAR LESS,
00:32:53.938 DECEIVING THESE RECEPTORS INTO TELLING OUR BRAIN THAT WE NEED TO EAT MORE. EVEN WORSE IS 500 CALORIES OF OIL,
00:33:00.979 WHICH IS ALMOST PURE FAT AND BARELY TRIGGERS ANY RESPONSE AT ALL. - THE PROBLEM WITH WEIGHT MANAGEMENT IN HUMANS
00:33:07.652 IS THAT IF YOU MAKE THESE FOODS COMPLETELY ARTIFICIAL, WHICH WE DO TODAY, YOU WIND UP WITH A PROBLEM THAT PEOPLE HAVE TO OVEREAT
00:33:14.525 JUST TO BE SATISFIED. Fulkerson: BUT WHY DO THESE CONCENTRATED FOODS THAT ARE SO HARMFUL TO US GIVE US SO MUCH PLEASURE?
00:33:21.733 DR. LISLE SAYS THE ANSWER IS RELATED TO A SYSTEM CALLED THE MOTIVATIONAL TRIAD.
00:33:26.938 THIS IS A TRIO OF BIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS THAT NATURE HAS DESIGNED INTO EVERY CREATURE ON EARTH
00:33:32.076 SO THEY CAN SURVIVE TO PASS THEIR GENES ON TO THE NEXT GENERATION. THE FIRST LEG OF THE MOTIVATIONAL TRIAD
00:33:38.449 IS PLEASURE SEEKING. - AND, PRIMARILY, TWO THINGS ARE THE CAUSE OF THAT,
00:33:43.621 AND THOSE TWO THINGS ARE FOOD AND SEX. SO IN THE CASE OF A GREAT WHITE SHARK, ITS BASICALLY GOT A NEON SIGN FLASHING ACROSS ITS FOREHEAD
00:33:51.429 SAYING, "FOOD, SEX, FOOD, SEX, FOOD, SEX." UNLESS IT'S A MALE, THEN IT SAYS, "SEX, FOOD, SEX, FOOD,"
00:33:56.801 BUT IT'S PRETTY MUCH THE SAME THING. Fulkerson: THE OTHER TWO LEGS OF THE MOTIVATIONAL TRIAD ARE AVOIDING PAIN
00:34:02.640 AND DOING EVERYTHING WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EFFORT. - PLEASURE SEEKING, PAIN AVOIDANCE, AND ENERGY CONSERVATION,
00:34:08.880 THAT REALLY SUMS UP ANIMAL BEHAVIOR, WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A PARAMECIUM UNDER A MICROSCOPE OR A GREAT WHITE SHARK.
00:34:14.752 Fulkerson: RICHER FOODS NATURALLY EXCITE OUR SENSES BECAUSE IT'S NATURE'S WAY OF TELLING US THEY WILL PROVIDE THE HIGHEST AMOUNT OF DIETARY REWARD
00:34:22.126 WITH THE LEAST AMOUNT OF EFFORT. THIS HELPED OUR ANCESTORS FIND THE MOST CALORIE-DENSE
00:34:27.598 AND RIPE FOODS AVAILABLE, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO OUR SURVIVAL.
00:34:32.969 BUT IN TODAY'S ENVIRONMENT, WE CAN ARTIFICIALLY INCREASE CALORIE DENSITY WELL BEYOND WHAT OUR ANCESTORS WOULD HAVE FOUND IN NATURE.
00:34:40.043 THE RESULTING FOODS GIVE US A HYPER-NORMAL AMOUNT OF PLEASURE, LEADING US INTO SOMETHING
00:34:45.416 DR. LISLE CALLS THE PLEASURE TRAP. WHAT THE PLEASURE TRAP IS IS AN INTERACTION
00:34:51.355 BETWEEN OUR NATURAL INSTINCTS, WHICH ARE TRYING TO TELL US THE RIGHT THING TO DO, AND SOME KIND OF ARTIFICIAL, MODERN STIMULATION
00:34:58.596 THAT IS PIGGYBACKING OR HIJACKING THAT PROCESS. SO THE CLASSIC EXAMPLE OF THE PLEASURE TRAP
00:35:04.202 WOULD BE DRUGS AND DRUG ADDICTION. THE WAY DRUGS WORK IS THEY HIJACK
00:35:10.041 THE EXISTING PLEASURE CIRCUITS. WHEN CERTAIN CHEMICALS HIT THOSE AREAS,
00:35:15.313 THEY CAUSE FEELINGS OF EUPHORIA AND EXCITEMENT. Fulkerson: THE SAME DRUG-LIKE EFFECT HAPPENS
00:35:20.418 WHEN WE EAT HIGHLY CONCENTRATED, PROCESSED FOODS. - WE'VE REMOVED THE FIBER, WE'VE REMOVED THE WATER,
00:35:26.524 WE'VE REMOVED THE MINERALS. WE'VE DONE EVERYTHING THAT WE CAN TO HYPER-CONCENTRATE SUGAR AND FAT
00:35:32.096 AND ADD A BUNCH OF SALT AS WELL INTO THE FOOD, AND NOW WHAT THE FOOD HAS BECOME IS IT'S BECOME A LOW-GRADE ADDICTION.
00:35:38.169 THESE THINGS ARE DRUGS. THEY HAVE OTHER DELETERIOUS SIDE EFFECTS, NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH IS ADDING A LOT OF EMPTY CALORIES.
00:35:45.209 Fulkerson: DR. TERRY MASON IS COMMISSIONER OF HEALTH FOR THE CITY OF CHICAGO. HE'S ONE OF THE FEW PUBLIC OFFICIALS IN AMERICA
00:35:51.682 WHO OPENLY SUPPORTS A PLANT-BASED DIET. - IF IT WALKED, HOPPED, SWAM, CRAWLED, SLITHERED,
00:35:58.356 HAD EYES, A MOM AND A DAD-- DON'T EAT IT. Fulkerson: DR. MASON CONTENDS
00:36:03.728 THAT THE LESS AFFLUENT SEGMENTS OF OUR POPULATION HAVE DIFFICULTY MAKING THE BEST FOOD CHOICES.
00:36:09.233 - WELL, FIRST OF ALL, THE DIETS ARE CALORIE-RICH AND NUTRIENT-POOR.
00:36:14.972 THIS IS THE REAL PROBLEM. AND, UNFORTUNATELY, POOR PEOPLE ARE POOR IN EVERYTHING.
00:36:21.312 THEY'RE POOR IN HEALTH, THEY'RE POOR IN FOOD CHOICES, THEY'RE POOR IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT THAT YOU COULD THINK OF.
00:36:27.852 Fulkerson: THIS MAKES THE LESS PROSPEROUS PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO THE LOW-GRADE ADDICTION OF HIGHLY PROCESSED FOODS.
00:36:34.525 - PEOPLE WANT STUFF THAT'S FAST, PEOPLE WANT STUFF THAT'S QUICK, AND THEY LIKE THE STUFF THAT'S SALTY,
00:36:40.464 AND THEY LIKE THE TASTE OF SOMETHING FRIED. AND SO THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT YOU SEE IN OUR COMMUNITY.
00:36:59.650 Fulkerson: SAN'DERA NATION LIVES IN A QUIET SUBURB IN CLEVELAND, OHIO, WITH HER FIVE CHILDREN.
00:37:05.156 IN OCTOBER 2008, SHE WAS STRICKEN BY A STRANGE ILLNESS. - I WANNA SAY SOMETHING, BUT IT'S NOT COMING OUT.
00:37:12.863 I'M GETTING REALLY SHAKY AND SWEATS, AND THEN I'M COLD AND I'M SICK AND I'M FATIGUED, AND MY STOMACH HURTS AND EVERYTHING.
00:37:19.270 SO I WENT TO THE DOCTOR, AND THAT'S WHEN HE DIAGNOSED ME WITH HYPERTENSION AND DIABETES.
00:37:25.776 Fulkerson: LIKE JOEY AUCOIN, SAN'DERA WAS TREATED WITH EXPENSIVE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
00:37:31.115 - I WAS IN DENIAL FOR A WHILE. I HEARD WHAT THEY SAID, BUT I WAS IN DENIAL, LIKE, MMM.
00:37:37.221 I STILL ATE THINGS I SHOULDN'T HAVE. I DIDN'T REALLY GET THE EDUCATION THAT I NEEDED TO KNOW,
00:37:43.127 SO I REALLY DEPENDED ON THAT PILL TO SAVE ME. Fulkerson: THEN SAN'DERA MET WITH DR. ESSELSTYN,
00:37:49.166 WHO RECOMMENDED THAT SHE TREAT HER ILLNESSES WITH A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET. - COME ON IN, AND WE'LL GET TO WORK.
00:37:56.274 - I WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS, BUT HE MADE IT REAL EASY FOR ME.
00:38:01.545 I WAS REAL INTERESTED IN WHAT HE HAD TO SAY AND WHAT HE WAS GOING TO TEACH ME AND THE NEW JOURNEY THAT I WOULD BE TAKING WITH HIM.
00:38:30.041 female translator: BETWEEN CHINA AND THE UNITED STATES... Fulkerson: IN 1974, CHINESE PREMIER ZHOU ENLAI WAS HOSPITALIZED WITH BLADDER CANCER.
00:38:38.649 KNOWING THAT HIS DISEASE WAS TERMINAL, HE DECIDED TO GIVE HIS COUNTRY A MORE COMPLETE UNDERSTANDING OF CANCER.
00:38:45.356 SO HE INITIATED WHAT WOULD BECOME ONE OF THE LARGEST AND MOST THOROUGH SCIENTIFIC STUDIES IN HISTORY.
00:38:51.829 650,000 RESEARCHERS CATALOGUED THE MORTALITY PATTERNS CAUSED BY SEVERAL TYPES OF CANCER
00:38:57.568 FOR THE YEARS BETWEEN 1973 AND 1975.
00:39:02.707 THE STUDY ENCOMPASSED EVERY COUNTY IN CHINA AND OVER 880 MILLION PEOPLE.
00:39:09.046 ZHOU DIED IN 1976, YEARS BEFORE HIS STUDY WAS COMPLETE. - OKAY, AND YOU'LL NEED HOW MANY SHIRTS?
00:39:16.921 PROBABLY THREE? - YEAH. - OKAY. Fulkerson: ZHOU ENLAI'S CANCER STUDY
00:39:22.460 WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON WHAT DR. CAMPBELL HIMSELF HAS CALLED THE CAPSTONE OF HIS RESEARCH.
00:39:33.604 - EARLY 1980. - AND YOU WERE THERE FOR TWO OR THREE MONTHS? Fulkerson: DR. JUNSHI CHEN IS NOW SENIOR RESEARCH PROFESSOR
00:39:39.677 WITH THE CHINESE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION. HE FIRST MET DR. CAMPBELL AT CORNELL IN 1980,
00:39:45.583 WHEN HE WAS A MEMBER OF THE CHINESE INSTITUTE OF FOOD AND NUTRITION SCIENCE.
00:39:50.721 THE COLD WAR WAS JUST BEGINNING TO THAW, AND DR. CHEN WAS AMONG THE FIRST SENIOR SCIENTISTS
00:39:55.926 FROM CHINA TO VISIT THE UNITED STATES. BY THEN, DR. CAMPBELL HAD BECOME ONE OF THE MOST DISTINGUISHED
00:40:01.665 NUTRITIONAL BIOCHEMISTS IN THE WORLD. WHEN THEY DISCOVERED THIS BOOK, A SIGNIFICANT COLLABORATION WAS BORN.
00:40:09.907 - THIS IS THE ATLAS OF CANCER MORTALITY IN CHINA.
00:40:14.945 Fulkerson: PUBLISHED IN 1981, THE CANCER ATLAS WAS THE RESULT OF ZHOU ENLAI'S NATIONWIDE STUDY.
00:40:22.119 IT SHOWED A HIGHLY UNUSUAL GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF CANCER IN CHINA,
00:40:27.892 WHICH TENDED TO BE CLUSTERED IN CERTAIN HOT SPOTS. THE SAME WAS TRUE WITH CANCER AFTER CANCER.
00:40:35.800 AND THE COUNTIES WITH THE HIGHEST LEVELS WERE OFTEN FAR GREATER THAN THE COUNTIES WITH THE LOWEST LEVELS.
00:40:40.838 - SO, FOR EXAMPLE, ESOPHAGEAL CANCER, ACCORDING TO THIS CANCER MAP,
00:40:46.610 THE MORTALITY HAS A 400-FOLD DIFFERENCE AMONG DIFFERENT COUNTIES IN CHINA.
00:40:54.351 - THAT'S HUGE. - YEAH. - AND IN--I UNDERSTOOD, IN THE UNITED STATES, ONLY SEVERAL-FOLD DIFFERENCE. NOT EVEN--
00:41:02.827 - MAYBE TWOFOLD OR SO, WE SEE. - YEAH, YEAH. SO THAT CAUGHT OUR ATTENTION
00:41:08.799 IN TERM OF, SO, WHY? BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL CHINESE.
00:41:14.071 GENETICALLY, THEY ARE ALL THE SAME. AND THE WHY THEY HAVE SO MUCH DIFFERENCE
00:41:19.443 IN SINGLE CANCER MORTALITY? SO WE BELIEVE IT HAS TO BE RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT.
00:41:26.517 THE BIGGER ENVIRONMENT. AND FROM OUR PROFESSIONAL PERSPECTIVE,
00:41:31.889 OF COURSE, IT'S DIET AND NUTRITION. - DR. CHEN AND I SAID, YOU KNOW, "WHY DON'T WE JUST GO THERE AND DO A STUDY?"
00:41:39.029 Fulkerson: FOR DR. CAMPBELL, IT WAS THE OPPORTUNITY HE'D BEEN LOOKING FOR. AMONG OTHER THINGS, HE COULD EXAMINE HOW HIS OBSERVATIONS
00:41:46.804 ABOUT LIVER CANCER IN FILIPINO CHILDREN AND THE FINDINGS FROM HIS LAB STUDIES
00:41:51.876 APPLIED TO A LARGE HUMAN POPULATION. THE PROJECT WOULD CONSIDER 367 DIET AND HEALTH-RELATED VARIABLES,
00:42:00.084 MAKING IT ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS NUTRITIONAL STUDIES EVER CONCEIVED.
00:42:05.389 DR. CAMPBELL AND HIS ASSOCIATES CAREFULLY CHOSE 65 COUNTIES SCATTERED ACROSS CHINA.
00:42:10.694 THESE COUNTIES WERE MAINLY LOCATED IN RURAL OR SEMI-RURAL AREAS. - WE USED THE RURAL COUNTIES
00:42:17.501 BECAUSE THEY ARE STABLE IN THEIR RESIDENTS, AND THEY HAVE BEEN IN THIS LIFESTYLE
00:42:23.741 FOR AT LEAST 20 TO 30 YEARS. Fulkerson: MORE THAN 350 WORKERS WERE TRAINED.
00:42:29.580 THEY CAREFULLY SURVEYED THE DIET AND LIFESTYLE OF 6,500 PEOPLE IN THE CHOSEN COUNTIES.
00:42:37.087 URINE AND BLOOD SAMPLES WERE ALSO TAKEN. IN 1983, DOCTORS CAMPBELL, CHEN, AND THEIR COLLABORATORS
00:42:45.996 BEGAN TO ANALYZE THE VAST AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT HAD BEEN COLLECTED. THE JOB WOULD TAKE YEARS.
00:42:57.274 AFTER EIGHT WEEKS EATING PLANT-BASED FOODS, JOEY AUCOIN WAS STILL OFF ALL HIS MEDICATIONS.
00:43:03.581 - WHEN I STARTED THIS, I HAD ALL THESE SIDE EFFECTS FROM MEDICATION AND FROM MY BEING SO UNHEALTHY.
00:43:09.119 BUT NOW I'M GETTING IN BETTER AND BETTER SHAPE EVERY DAY. I FEEL MORE HEALTHY. I VERY SELDOM GET TIRED DURING THE DAY.
00:43:15.593 I JUST FEEL SO GOOD ALL THE TIME. THIS--THIS IS THE SCALE THAT I WEIGH MYSELF ON. AND IT STARTED ABOUT EIGHT WEEKS AGO WAY UP HERE AROUND 218, 220.
00:43:25.469 AND NOW IT'S BOUNCING BETWEEN 180 AND 185. NONE OF MY BELTS FIT.
00:43:30.941 THIS ONE HERE, I ACTUALLY HAD TO HAVE TWO NEW HOLES PUNCHED IN, 'CAUSE I LIKED THE BELT SO MUCH.
00:43:36.280 NOTHING FITS. I GOTTA GO SHOPPING. IT'S JUST EVERYTHING, ALL MY CLOTHES. A GOOD PROBLEM TO HAVE.
00:43:42.186 - IT'S BEEN FUN FOR HIM, BECAUSE I THINK HE'S LEARNED IN ADDITION TO THE FACT THAT HE'S SEEING SUCH GREAT RESULTS,
00:43:47.358 THAT IT'S...HE LOVES IT. - I DON'T THINK HE'LL GO BACK TO HIS OLD WAYS. HE FEELS TOO GOOD, AND HE LIKES--
00:43:54.798 EVEN IF HE STARTED TO GO OFF A LITTLE BIT, HE FEELS TOO GOOD, HIS ENERGY'S TOO GOOD, HE LOOKS YOUNGER.
00:44:00.037 - AND THE FACT THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK ON ALL THE MEDS, YOU KNOW, IF HE DID, I THINK THAT THAT'S A HUGE MOTIVATION
00:44:05.609 FOR HIM TO MAINTAIN THE LIFESTYLE.
00:44:13.751 Fulkerson: IN THE MID-1980s, DR. CALDWELL ESSELSTYN WAS STRUGGLING TO ORGANIZE A STUDY
00:44:19.123 ON CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE. HIS PLAN WAS TO PUT A GROUP OF PATIENTS ON A DIET OF LOW-FAT PLANT-BASED FOODS,
00:44:25.763 ALONG WITH SMALL QUANTITIES OF LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS AND MINIMAL AMOUNTS OF CHOLESTEROL REDUCING DRUGS.
00:44:33.737 - AND SLOWLY OVER THE NEXT, UH, 18 MONTHS, I GOT THE 24 PATIENTS THAT I HAD ASKED FOR.
00:44:38.909 BUT THE ONES THEY SENT ME [laughs] WERE A LITTLE BIT SICKER THAN I HAD THOUGHT. THESE WERE PATIENTS WHO HAD FAILED
00:44:44.848 THEIR FIRST OR SECOND BYPASS OPERATION. THEY HAD FAILED THEIR FIRST OR SECOND ANGIOPLASTY. AND THERE WERE FIVE WHO WERE TOLD
00:44:50.954 BY THEIR EXPERT CARDIOLOGISTS THEY WOULD NOT LIVE OUT THE YEAR. Fulkerson: ONE OF THE MOST GRAVELY ILL PATIENTS
00:44:56.660 WAS A 59-YEAR-OLD SPEECH AND COMMUNICATIONS TEACHER, EVELYN OSWICK.
00:45:01.832 - ATE ALL THE CHOCOLATE CANDY I COULD EAT, ATE EVERY DOUGHNUT I COULD PUT MY HANDS ON. OH, I JUST LOVE THINGS LIKE THAT,
00:45:08.338 A LOT OF GRAVY. AND THEN, UM, I HAD MY-- I HAVE HAD TWO HEART ATTACKS BEFORE I MET DR. ESSELSTYN.
00:45:15.579 WHEN I HAD THE SECOND HEART ATTACK, THE DOCTOR SAID THAT I SHOULD PREPARE FOR DEATH,
00:45:22.086 REALLY IS WHAT HE SAID. AND I LOOKED AT HIM AND I SAID, "DO YOU REALLY MEAN THAT WHAT YOU WANT ME TO DO
00:45:27.958 "IS BUY A ROCKING CHAIR AND JUST SIT THERE AND ROCK AWAY AND WAIT?" AND HE JUST LOOKED AT ME AND HE SAID,
00:45:33.297 "YES, THAT'S JUST EXACTLY WHAT I'M SAYING."
00:45:39.436 Fulkerson: ANTHONY YEN WAS BORN AND RAISED IN CHINA. - AND WE WERE EATING A TYPICAL CHINESE CULTURAL DIET.
00:45:48.245 A VERY SMALL PIECE OF MEAT. BUT THEY SLICED IT, AND SO IT WAS COOKED FOR FLAVOR
00:45:56.487 RATHER THAN YOUR AMERICAN STYLE, WHEN YOU EAT, YOU EAT A LARGE, GREAT, BIG PIECE OF MEAT,
00:46:01.692 WHICH YOU COULD EASILY FED THE WHOLE FAMILY IN CHINA. AND WE EAT A LOT OF VEGETABLES IN CHINA.
00:46:08.398 AND WE HAD SOUP. BUT ONCE I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES, YOU FIND BEGINNING TO EXPERIENCE FAST FOOD.
00:46:15.806 THE HAMBURGERS AND CHEESEBURGERS, PIZZA. AND I NOTICED MY WEIGHT BEGINNING TO GAIN.
00:46:21.912 Fulkerson: WHEN MR. YEN WAS 56 YEARS OLD, HE SUDDENLY EXPERIENCED SEVERE CHEST PAINS.
00:46:28.418 - AT THAT POINT IN TIME, I HAD A OPEN HEART SURGERY. I HAVE FIVE BYPASS--FIVE.
00:46:36.126 BUT IT WAS VERY INTERESTING. ABOUT A WEEK LATER, UH,
00:46:42.432 I FELT MY CHEST TIGHTEN UP AGAIN. SO MYSELF AND MY WIFE WENT TO SEE DR. ESSELSTYN.
00:46:51.175 - I SAW EVERY ONE OF THESE PATIENTS MYSELF EVERY TWO WEEKS FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS.
00:46:57.114 AND AT THAT VISIT, WE WOULD GET A FULL CHOLESTEROL LIPID PROFILE.
00:47:02.219 WE WOULD GET BLOOD PRESSURE, WEIGHT, AND I WOULD GO OVER EVERY MORSEL THEY ATE. Fulkerson: BY USING SIMPLE FOODS
00:47:09.459 AS THE MAIN TREATMENT FOR HIS PATIENTS, DR. ESSELSTYN WAS BUCKING A HIGH-TECH, HIGH-COST SYSTEM
00:47:16.133 THAT WAS DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN BOTH BIG MEDICINE AND BIG GOVERNMENT. - YOU KNOW, BEHIND MY BACK,
00:47:21.839 I GOT TO BE KNOWN AS DR. SPROUTS. BUT I GUESS I'VE ALWAYS LIKED A CHALLENGE.
00:47:31.114 - WE PREHEATED THE OVEN, GOT THE WATER GOING. I JUST ADDED SOME SEASONINGS. AND THEN WE ADD THE ONIONS AND THE SPINACH.
00:47:37.955 - I'VE NEVER BEEN A MORNING PERSON, MY WHOLE LIFE. AND, UH, BUT PREVIOUS TO THIS EXPERIENCE,
00:47:45.062 UM, IT HAD PROBABLY BEEN WORSE THAN EVER. AND THAT ENTAILED NEEDING TO GET UP IN THE MORNING
00:47:53.704 AND CAFFEINATE MYSELF WITH COKES AND RED BULLS AND STUFF LIKE THAT,
00:47:58.709 UH, BEFORE I COULD EVEN THINK OR START TO WORK. WE DIDN'T MAKE THE RICE NOODLES,
00:48:04.581 BUT YOU CAN JUST BOIL THEM REAL QUICK AND THEN THROW THIS ON TOP OF THEM. - RIGHT, RIGHT.
00:48:09.920 HE'S ACTUALLY EATING MORE OFTEN, BUT HE'S EATING THE RIGHT FOODS, AND HE LOST WEIGHT. SO HE CERTAINLY FEELS MUCH BETTER THAT WAY.
00:48:17.928 AND YOU CAN TELL IT IN HIS FACE, IN HIS NECK, YOU KNOW, IN HIS BELLY. IT'S ALL--HE'S LOST A LOT OF WEIGHT THERE.
00:48:24.034 HE ALSO HAS A BETTER ENERGY. UM, HE'S WAKING UP EARLIER NOW. THAT'S GREAT, BECAUSE WE HAVE THEN SOME MORNING TIME TOGETHER.
00:48:29.773 - I DON'T HAVE TO CARRY ANYTHING. - YOU'RE THE DOCTOR. [both chuckling]
00:48:38.482 Fulkerson: 1990. FOLLOWING NEARLY A DECADE OF INTENSE EFFORT, DR. CAMPBELL AND HIS COLLEAGUES
00:48:44.788 FINALLY PUBLISH THEIR CHINA STUDY. IT IDENTIFIED NO LESS THAN 94,000 CORRELATIONS
00:48:51.261 BETWEEN DIET AND DISEASE. - THOSE ARE BIG NUMBERS FOR ANY STUDY. AND IN THE END OF THE DAY,
00:48:56.733 WHEN WE DID ALL THESE CORRELATIONS IN THIS BOOK HERE, AND WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBER OF THEM THAT WERE STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT,
00:49:02.806 IT WAS BETWEEN ABOUT 8,000 TO 9,000. WHEN YOU HAVE THAT LARGE NUMBER OF CORRELATIONS THEN YOU START ANALYZING EACH ONE,
00:49:10.514 IF IT WORKS OUT AS STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT, THIS MEANS THAT IF 19 OUT OF 20 ARE POINTING IN THE SAME DIRECTION,
00:49:16.720 IT'S HIGHLY SIGNIFICANT AND LIKELY TO BE TRUE. Fulkerson: HUNDREDS OF DETAILED TABLES AND CHARTS
00:49:22.993 WERE INCLUDED IN THE STUDY. EACH ONE PRESENTED THE RAW DATA THAT WAS COLLECTED.
00:49:28.231 THEN THIS INFORMATION WAS CROSS-REFERENCED IN MULTIPLE WAYS TO DEMONSTRATE ITS RELIABILITY AND TO SHOW HOW IT LINKED WITH THE 367 VARIABLES
00:49:36.306 THE STUDY EXAMINED. - I THINK THE MAJOR MESSAGE WE GOT OUT OF ALL THESE CORRELATION ANALYSES
00:49:46.583 IS ONLY ONE MESSAGE. THE PLANT FOOD-BASED DIET,
00:49:52.022 MAINLY CEREAL GRAINS, VEGETABLES, AND FRUITS, AND VERY LITTLE ANIMAL FOOD
00:49:59.796 IS ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER MORTALITY OF CERTAIN CANCERS,
00:50:06.370 STROKE, AND CORONARY HEART DISEASE. Fulkerson: THE NEW YORK TIMES CALLED IT
00:50:12.275 "THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE LARGE STUDY EVER UNDERTAKEN "OF THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN DIET AND THE RISK OF DEVELOPING DISEASE."
00:50:19.449 FOR DR. CAMPBELL, HE FINALLY HAD LARGE-SCALE DATA ON PEOPLE, AND IT WAS REMARKABLY CONSISTENT WITH HIS EARLIER DISCOVERIES.
00:50:27.657 TOGETHER, HE FOUND THAT THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE WAS CLEAR: WHOLE, PLANT-BASED FOODS WERE BENEFICIAL TO HUMAN HEALTH,
00:50:36.199 WHILE ANIMAL-BASED FOODS WERE NOT.
00:50:46.476 SAN'DERA NATION'S JOURNEY TO BETTER HEALTH WASN'T EASY AT FIRST. - IT WAS A LITTLE HARD, 'CAUSE I'D BEEN EATING FATTY FOODS
00:50:53.817 AND GREASE AND EVERYTHING FOR 38 YEARS, YOU KNOW, AS LONG AS I CAN REMEMBER,
00:50:59.589 SO IT WAS KINDA HARD TO GO FROM THAT TO CHANGING THE NEXT DAY COMPLETELY.
00:51:06.363 I STARTED A JOURNAL FOR MAYBE THE FIRST THREE WEEKS, WRITE DOWN MY FEELINGS AND EMOTIONS,
00:51:12.302 WHAT I FELT LIKE... SO THAT OTHER PEOPLE COULD KNOW IT'S OKAY TO FEEL THAT WAY.
00:51:18.141 Fulkerson: ALONG THE WAY, SAN'DERA HAD STRONG SUPPORT FROM DR. ESSELSTYN
00:51:23.146 AND HIS WIFE ANN. - THEY KEEP IN TOUCH, AND THEY'RE LIKE, "WE HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU,"
00:51:29.086 AND I KNOW THEY HAVEN'T. I REALLY FEEL HERE THAT THEY HAVEN'T. "I WENT TO WAL-MART THIS DAY.
00:51:34.658 "I HAD WANTED A SUBWAY SANDWICH, "AND I SAID I'M GONNA GET ME THAT MEATBALL SUB. "I THEN RECEIVED A CALL WHILE I WAS AT WAL-MART
00:51:41.665 "FROM MRS. ESSELSTYN, "AS IF THEY KNEW I WAS WEAK AT THIS MOMENT.
00:51:48.238 "SHE STATED, 'PROMISE ME "YOU WILL NOT EAT ANYTHING FROM WAL-MART.'
00:51:53.276 "IT GAVE ME CHILLS TO KNOW THAT SHE CALLED AT THAT MOMENT. "THEREFORE I LEFT THE STORE WITHOUT GETTING THAT MEATBALL SUB."
00:52:01.184 - WHAT DO YOU SEE? Fulkerson: WHILE DR. CAMPBELL WAS PUBLISHING HIS CHINA STUDY, DR. ESSELSTYN WAS GETTING SOME POWERFUL DATA
00:52:08.725 FROM THE RESEARCH HE'D STARTED IN 1985. HE BEGAN WITH 24 PATIENTS,
00:52:14.364 BUT 6 HAD DROPPED OUT IN THE FIRST YEAR, LEAVING HIM WITH A TOTAL OF 18.
00:52:19.636 - AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS, WE HAD FOLLOW-UP ANGIOGRAMS, AND 11 OF THE GROUP HAD HALTED THEIR DISEASE.
00:52:25.509 THERE WAS NO PROGRESSION. AND THERE WERE FOUR WHERE WE HAD RATHER EXCITING EVIDENCE
00:52:30.847 OF REGRESSION OF DISEASE. Fulkerson: THESE RESULTS WERE ASTONISHING. THE DIET PRODUCED SOMETHING THAT MEDICATION AND SURGERY
00:52:38.321 NEVER HAD BEFORE: ACTUAL REVERSALS OF HEART DISEASE.
00:52:43.426 THE BIOLOGICAL MECHANISM THAT CAUSED THESE REVERSALS CENTERS ON THE LINING OF OUR VEINS AND ARTERIES--
00:52:49.733 THE ENDOTHELIAL CELLS. - THEY ARE THE ABSOLUTE LIFE JACKETS OF OUR BLOOD VESSELS.
00:52:55.639 YOU'RE YOUNG, AND YOU'RE A TEENAGER, YOU'RE HEALTHY, YOU COULD SPREAD THOSE OUT ONE LAYER THICK,
00:53:00.977 AND YOU'D HAVE SOMETHING THAT WOULD COVER SIX OR EIGHT TENNIS COURTS. Fulkerson: IN 1988, SCIENTISTS DISCOVERED
00:53:06.783 THAT ENDOTHELIAL CELLS MANUFACTURED THE GAS NITRIC OXIDE. - WELL, WHAT DID NITRIC OXIDE DO?
00:53:13.723 NITRIC OXIDE KEEPS OUR BLOOD FLOWING SMOOTHLY WITHOUT BEING STICKY.
00:53:20.630 Fulkerson: IT ALSO HELPS TO DILATE CONSTRICTED BLOOD VESSELS DURING PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND INHIBITS THE FORMATION OF PLAQUE.
00:53:27.837 - AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, NITRIC OXIDE IS A POWERFUL FORCE FOR ELIMINATING THE INFLAMMATION
00:53:35.679 THAT SEEMS TO GO WITH THIS PLAQUE. Fulkerson: HOWEVER, SCIENTIFIC TESTS HAVE DEMONSTRATED
00:53:41.251 THAT WHEN WE START EATING THE TYPICAL WESTERN DIET, OUR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS ARE DAMAGED.
00:53:46.990 - WHEN YOU'RE GETTING TO BE IN YOUR 40s AND 50s AND 60s, AND YOU'VE BEEN SLAUGHTERING YOUR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS,
00:53:53.263 YOU DON'T HAVE THOSE SIX OR EIGHT TENNIS COURTS. YOU MAY BE DOWN TO ONE AND A HALF OR TWO, AND THEY CAN'T PROTECT YOU.
00:53:58.935 Fulkerson: YET ACCORDING TO DR. ESSELSTYN, WHEN WE BEGIN EATING A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET,
00:54:05.141 THE DAMAGE TO OUR ENDOTHELIAL CELLS NOT ONLY STOPS, IT STARTS TO REVERSE.
00:54:18.622 ABOUT FIVE YEARS INTO HIS STUDY, ESSELSTYN MADE A SMALL BUT SIGNIFICANT CHANGE
00:54:23.627 IN HIS PATIENTS' MENU. IT STARTED IN 1990, WHEN HE READ THE GLOWING REVIEW OF DR. CAMPBELL'S CHINA STUDY
00:54:30.867 IN THE NEW YORK TIMES. - DR. ESSELSTYN SAW THAT, AND HE INVITED ME TO COME TO A CONFERENCE
00:54:37.641 HE WAS ORGANIZING IN ARIZONA. Fulkerson: THESE TWO REVOLUTIONARIES, WHO, UP UNTIL THEN, HAD BEEN ON SIMILAR BUT SEPARATE PATHS
00:54:45.282 FINALLY MET FACE-TO-FACE. - ON THE ONE HAND, I'M COMING FROM THE SCIENTIFIC GROUP,
00:54:50.954 GETTING SOME IDEAS. HE'S COMING FROM THE CLINICAL ROUTE AND DOING SOME DRAMATIC RESEARCH.
00:54:57.394 HERE'S THE SCIENCE, HERE'S THE CLINICAL EVIDENCE. PUT THE TWO TOGETHER, IT'S AMAZING. Fulkerson: WHEN HE LEARNED OF CAMPBELL'S RESEARCH,
00:55:04.200 ESSELSTYN REMOVED DAIRY PRODUCTS FROM HIS PATIENTS' DIET. THE RESULTS OF HIS ONGOING STUDY CONTINUED TO BE IMPRESSIVE,
00:55:11.875 AND IN 1995, HE PUBLISHED A PAPER DETAILING THEM IN A NOTED SCIENTIFIC JOURNAL.
00:55:17.947 YET ONE OF ESSELSTYN'S MOST REMARKABLE SUCCESS STORIES INVOLVED A COLLEAGUE OF HIS AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC,
00:55:23.953 DR. JOSEPH CROWE. - ACTUALLY I WAS, UM, ACTIVE, HEALTHY,
00:55:30.160 VERY BUSY, UH, MID-40s, ABSOLUTELY, UM, NO RISK FACTORS
00:55:37.467 AT ALL FOR ANY HEART PROBLEM. Fulkerson: BUT DR. CROWE, EVEN WITH WHAT WAS CONSIDERED TO BE
00:55:44.474 A HEALTHY CHOLESTEROL LEVEL, WAS ACTUALLY RAVAGED BY HEART DISEASE.
00:55:49.512 THIS ANGIOGRAM, TAKEN AFTER HIS FIRST NEARLY FATAL HEART ATTACK IN 1996,
00:55:54.984 SHOWS HOW BADLY DAMAGED ONE OF HIS CORONARY ARTERIES WAS. THIS ANGIOGRAM WAS DONE AFTER LESS THAN THREE YEARS
00:56:02.359 OF ENTIRELY DIETARY TREATMENT.
00:56:11.701 DR. CROWE WAS FORTUNATE. IN 25% OF CASES, SUDDEN DEATH
00:56:16.773 IS THE FIRST AND ONLY SIGN OF CORONARY ARTERY DISEASE.
00:56:21.945 OF DR. ESSELSTYN'S ORIGINAL 18 PATIENTS, ALL SURVIVED THE INITIAL 12 YEARS OF THE STUDY.
00:56:29.486 TODAY, 14 PATIENTS ARE STILL ALIVE OVER TWO DECADES AFTER THE STUDY BEGAN.
00:56:35.859 - THE THING ABOUT ESSY, ALTHOUGH HE'S ALWAYS VERY PLEASANT, WHEN YOU SAID, "I'M GOING TO BE ON THIS PROGRAM
00:56:43.099 AND I'M GOING TO STAY WITH THIS DIET," YOU STAYED WITH THE DIET, OR THERE WAS THE DOOR. YOU HAD NO CHOICE.
00:56:48.805 I MEAN, HIS SMILES ARE WONDERFUL, BUT HE IS VERY STERN.
00:56:54.477 YOU KNOW, THAT'S WHY I'M STILL LIVING. BUT, YOU KNOW, HE'S JUST... HE'S JUST A WONDERFUL MAN.
00:57:02.419 - AND I LOOK AT THE PICTURES... SOME OF MY PICTURES YEARS AGO, 20 YEARS AGO ACTUALLY LOOKS OLDER THAN TODAY.
00:57:09.759 THE ONLY THING IS I LOST MORE HAIR, YOU KNOW? Fulkerson: ANTHONY AND THE OTHER MALE PATIENTS
00:57:15.698 ALSO NOTED ANOTHER CHANGE. - WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG, WHEN YOU WERE TEENAGER, YOU SEE A FEMALE OR SO ON, IT GETS KIND OF EXCITED.
00:57:25.141 AND THE FIRST REACTION PHYSICALLY, YOU KNOW, IT GETS ATTENTION, YOU KNOW?
00:57:30.447 RAISE THE FLAG, I CALL IT. THIS HAPPENED TO US, ALL THE OTHER, UH,
00:57:36.519 DR. ESSELSTYN'S, UH, I CALL 'EM ALL THE GUINEA PIGS. THE FLAG STILL RISES.
00:57:43.193 - TALKING TO YOUR DOCTOR ABOUT E.D. MAY BE THE LAST THING YOU WANNA DO, BUT IT'S DEFINITELY A CONVERSATION WORTH HAVING.
00:57:49.599 - I'M A PRACTICING UROLOGIST AND HAVE BEEN SO FOR THE LAST 25 YEARS. AND ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION IS ACTUALLY
00:57:56.473 THE FIRST CLINICAL INDICATOR OF GENERALIZED CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE.
00:58:01.911 IT'S THE CANARY IN THE COAL MINE. IT'S THE THING THAT LETS YOU KNOW THAT YOU HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT ENDOTHELIAL
00:58:08.485 AND VASCULAR DISEASE, MUCH EARLIER THAN WILL A HEART ATTACK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.
00:58:14.657 WE HAVE TO STOP THINKING OF THE BODY LIKE IT'S COMPARTMENTALIZED. IT REALLY ISN'T. THE BLOOD GOES EVERYWHERE IN THE BODY.
00:58:21.197 AND SO IF YOU HAVE VASCULAR DISEASE ANYWHERE, YOU HAVE IT EVERYWHERE.
00:58:27.837 Fulkerson: DESPITE THE APPARENT SUCCESS OF THE DIETARY APPROACH, SOME CRITICS SAY EATING THIS WAY IS EXTREME.
00:58:37.013 - NOW, WITH THE WESTERN DIET, THIS GUARANTEES THERE ARE GONNA BE WHAT?
00:58:42.218 A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY THIS YEAR WHO WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE FRONT HALF OF THEIR BODY DIVIDED,
00:58:48.525 THEIR HEART EXPOSED, THEN VEINS WILL BE TAKEN FROM THEIR LEG AND SEWED ON THEIR HEART.
00:58:54.731 SOME PEOPLE WOULD CALL THAT EXTREME. Fulkerson: DR. ESSELSTYN HAS NOW SUCCESSFULLY TREATED
00:59:01.004 OVER 250 PATIENTS WITH HEART DISEASE, USING ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET.
00:59:08.211 - HEART DISEASE, AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED, IS AN ABSOLUTELY TOOTHLESS PAPER TIGER THAT NEED NEVER, EVER EXIST.
00:59:15.051 AND IF IT DOES EXIST, IT NEED NEVER, EVER PROGRESS.
00:59:21.691 [dramatic music] ♪ ♪
00:59:43.146 Fulkerson: LAS VEGAS, NEVADA. AT THE EXTREME COUTURE GYM, WE FOUND AN EXTRAORDINARY PLANT-BASED ATHLETE--
00:59:50.687 ULTIMATE FIGHTER CHAMPION MAC DANZIG. IN THE MIXED MARTIAL ARTS WORLD,
00:59:56.326 STRENGTH, TOUGHNESS, AND ENDURANCE ARE OF PARAMOUNT IMPORTANCE, AND MAC HAS THEM ALL.
01:00:03.800 - I HAD CUT DAIRY OUT OF MY DIET WHEN I WAS ABOUT 18 YEARS OLD, UM, BECAUSE I HAD A, UH...
01:00:09.505 EAR, NOSE, AND THROAT ALLERGY TO DAIRY, AND I WAS GETTING A LOT OF EAR INFECTIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT.
01:00:15.278 SO WHEN I CUT THAT OUT, REALLY THE ONLY THING THAT WAS SEPARATING ME FROM HAVING A VEGAN DIET
01:00:21.250 WAS CHICKEN AND FISH. SO I WAS JUST EATING THAT FOR YEARS, AND I WAS EATING IT BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT I NEEDED TO,
01:00:26.889 BECAUSE EVERYONE TELLS YOU, YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE AN ATHLETE, YOU NEED, YOU KNOW, AT LEAST CHICKEN AND FISH IN YOUR DIET FOR PROTEIN.
01:00:32.862 YOU KNOW, SOMETHING THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE MYTHS THAT'S BEEN PERPETUATED FOR A WHILE.
01:00:39.636 ALL IT TOOK WAS ME CUTTING THE CHICKEN AND FISH OUT, AND I DID IT COLD TURKEY. I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE, STEREOTYPICALLY SPEAKING,
01:00:46.042 THINK SOMEONE THAT'S A VEGAN IS, LIKE, SOME SKINNY HIPPIE TYPE OF PERSON, AND, UH, YOU KNOW, I'M NOT NECESSARILY
01:00:51.881 TRYING TO BREAK THE STEREOTYPE. I JUST--I TRIED THE DIET FOR MY OWN PERSONAL REASONS,
01:00:57.720 AND IT WORKED FOR ME, I FEEL LIKE I HAVE MORE ENERGY
01:01:03.192 NOW THAT I DON'T EAT THE MEAT PRODUCTS. AND I ALSO FEEL LIKE I RECOVER BETTER IN BETWEEN MY WORKOUTS.
01:01:11.000 I'M NOT TRYING TO BE PART OF SOME EXCLUSIVE CLUB OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. I'M JUST DOING MY THING, AND, UM,
01:01:18.608 YOU KNOW, DON'T PLAN ON EATING MEAT OR DAIRY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.
01:01:26.282 - THIS, UH, GUIDE IS CALLED THE TYPE "A" PLANNING GUIDE. NOW, IT INCLUDES FOODS THAT ARE FOUND
01:01:33.890 IN THE BASIC FOUR FOOD GROUPS, BECAUSE WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE TOTAL DAILY NEEDS,
01:01:38.928 AND THIS IS A PART OF IT. - WE MUST SERVE 1/2 PINT OF FRESH FLUID MILK TO PROVIDE CALCIUM, RIBOFLAVIN,
01:01:48.671 AND THE OTHER NUTRIENTS THAT ARE NEEDED FOR OUR CHILDREN. Fulkerson: FOR DECADES,
01:01:53.776 THE DAIRY INDUSTRY AND U.S. GOVERNMENT HAVE BEEN SAYING THAT MILK IS GOOD FOR OUR BONES.
01:01:59.282 WHILE ALL WHOLE FOODS CONTAIN CALCIUM, AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT FOR BONE HEALTH,
01:02:04.353 IT IS ARGUED THAT WE NEED THE HIGHER AMOUNTS FOUND IN DAIRY. CHILDREN AND AGING WOMEN IN PARTICULAR
01:02:10.827 HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT TO DRINK MORE AND MORE AND MORE MILK.
01:02:16.065 - WHAT DO YOU THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT NUTRIENT WE GET FROM DAIRY PRODUCTS IS, LIKE MILK? - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM.
01:02:22.138 - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM. - CALCIUM.
01:02:28.811 - THE SCIENCE IN TERMS OF DAIRY'S ROLE IN HEALTHY BONES IS PRETTY STRONG, AND, IN FACT, THE NATIONAL OSTEOPOROSIS FOUNDATION,
01:02:36.385 OF COURSE, UTILIZES THAT SCIENCE IN THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. Fulkerson: OSTEOPOROSIS IS A DEGENERATIVE BONE DISEASE,
01:02:42.725 WHICH HAS BEEN WIDELY LINKED TO A LACK OF CALCIUM. IF THIS IS TRUE, NATIONS WITH A HIGH INTAKE OF DAIRY PRODUCTS,
01:02:49.665 WHICH ARE A MAJOR SOURCE OF CALCIUM IN A WESTERNIZED DIET, SHOULD HAVE LOW LEVELS OF OSTEOPOROSIS.
01:02:56.973 BUT ACCORDING TO A STUDY DONE BY A DISTINGUISHED HARVARD RESEARCHER, NATIONS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF CALCIUM INTAKE
01:03:04.147 TEND TO HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF HIP FRACTURES, WHICH IS A KEY INDICATOR FOR OSTEOPOROSIS.
01:03:10.286 - AND SO, IN FACT, THE HIGHER THE DAIRY CONSUMPTION, THE HIGHER THE RATE OF OSTEOPOROSIS--
01:03:15.391 EXACTLY THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT THE DAIRY INDUSTRY HAS BEEN TELLING US FOR SO LONG. ONE OF THE PRIMARY MECHANISMS FOR THAT IS THAT ANIMAL PROTEIN
01:03:23.766 TENDS TO CREATE AN ACID-LIKE CONDITION IN THE BODY CALLED METABOLIC ACIDOSIS.
01:03:29.338 Fulkerson: TO COMBAT THIS CONDITION, THE BODY DRAWS UPON ITS MOST READILY AVAILABLE ACID BUFFER,
01:03:35.111 NAMELY CALCIUM IN OUR BONES. AS THE CALCIUM IS EXTRACTED TO NEUTRALIZE THE EXCESS ACID,
01:03:41.250 OUR BONES ARE WEAKENED. IN DEFENDING THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF MILK,
01:03:47.056 MANY NATIONAL HEALTH ORGANIZATIONS NOW RECOMMEND THAT WE CONSUME LOW-FAT DAIRY PRODUCTS.
01:03:52.428 - IT CAN BE MILK, IT CAN BE YOGURT, IT CAN BE CHEESE, IT CAN BE ANYTHING MADE FROM MILK.
01:03:58.501 BUT AGAIN, THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE, IT'S A MESSAGE THAT COMES FROM THE AMERICAN DIETETIC ASSOCIATION,
01:04:04.507 THE NATIONAL OSTEOPOROSIS FOUNDATION, CANCER, HEART, WE'RE ALL ON THE SAME PAGE.
01:04:09.779 IT NEEDS TO BE LOW-FAT OR FAT-FREE. - SO AS THE FAT'S TAKEN OUT, THE PROTEIN BECOMES A LARGER PROPORTION OF THE TOTAL.
01:04:19.055 SO THEY BECOME HIGHER IN PROTEIN, LOWER IN FAT. AND WHEN WE COMPARE THESE HIGH-PROTEIN,
01:04:25.728 LOW-FAT MILK PRODUCTS, FOR EXAMPLE, WITH PROSTATE CANCER, THE RELATIONSHIP IS AS STRONG AS IT IS
01:04:32.201 FOR CIGARETTE SMOKING AND LUNG CANCER. - MOST OF THESE ANIMALS HERE ARE WHAT WE CALL HEIFERS.
01:04:39.275 - UH-HUH. - THEY'RE THE YOUNG FEMALES, NOT YET COWS. - SO THEY HAVEN'T HAD THEIR FIRST CALF YET.
01:04:44.847 - HAVEN'T HAD THEIR FIRST CALF. - SO THEY HAVE TO HAVE THEIR FIRST CALF BEFORE THEY CAN LACTATE. - AND ONCE THEY COME INTO LACTATION, THEY ALMOST KEEP THEM, THESE DAYS,
01:04:50.753 THEY KEEP THEM PREGNANT CONTINUOUSLY FOR THREE OF FOUR YEARS. - WHY ARE THEY EATING GRASS NOW?
01:04:55.791 - WELL, THIS IS THE LAST TIME, IN THEIR LIFETIME, THEY'RE GOING TO SEE GRASS. AFTER THAT THEY'RE IN THE BARN, THEY'RE STANDING UP FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIFE.
01:05:02.765 - WHEN I WAS YOUNG, WE DEFENDED OUR PRODUCT, PROMOTED OUR PRODUCT, BECAUSE IT WAS NATURE'S MOST PERFECT FOOD.
01:05:09.205 AND, UH, SO I BELIEVED THAT. BUT IT TOOK A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TWIST AS TIME PASSED.
01:05:15.745 I MEAN, IT'S THE MOST PERFECT FOOD FOR CALVES. AND TRYING TO SWITCH THE MILK OF ONE SPECIES TO ANOTHER SPECIES
01:05:21.651 DOESN'T MAKE A LOTTA SENSE.
01:05:26.889 Fulkerson: ONLY TWO MONTHS INTO HER TREATMENT, SAN'DERA WAS EXPERIENCING DRAMATIC EFFECTS
01:05:32.028 ON HER TYPE 2 DIABETES AND HYPERTENSION. SINCE I'VE BEEN ON A PLANT-BASED DIET,
01:05:38.701 BLOOD PRESSURE'S BEEN WONDERFUL. MY BLOOD SUGARS ARE IN THE 80s. IT SHOCKS ME, 70s.
01:05:45.241 SO I WAS ALARMED WHEN IT WAS 60. I'M LIKE, "AAH! ISN'T THAT BAD? IT'S 60?" YOU KNOW, AND I TALKED TO THE DIABETES EDUCATOR,
01:05:51.814 WHICH IS WONDERFUL. SHE'S LIKE, "NO, THAT'S A NORMAL BLOOD SUGAR." YOU'RE PANCREAS IS WORKING, IT'S REVERSING."
01:05:58.387 Fulkerson: IRONICALLY, SAN'DERA WORKS AT AN OUTPATIENT FACILITY FOR DIABETICS. YET THE TREATMENT THAT WAS
01:06:05.094 ACHIEVING SUCCESS WITH HER DIABETES CAME FROM OUTSIDE THE ESTABLISHED MEDICAL SYSTEM.
01:06:10.232 THE POSITIVE RESULTS WENT FAR BEYOND SAN'DERA'S CHRONIC DISEASES. - MENTALLY, NOT HAVING THE SLUGGISHNESS,
01:06:17.740 THE FEAR OF THE DISEASE PROGRESSING. BECAUSE I FEEL I'M IN CONTROL AND HAVE POWER OF TAKING IT BACK THE RIGHT WAY NOW.
01:06:24.747 SO, MENTALLY, I FEEL GREAT. I'M EATING THE THINGS I SHOULD EAT. THE ONE THING THAT IS TRUE THAT ANN SAID TO ME,
01:06:31.687 "YOU REALLY START TASTING THE REAL TASTE OF WHAT YOU'RE EATING," CAUSE I'D EAT A PEACH, AND YOU'D THINK... [sighs] I WAS IN HEAVEN WITH MY WHITE PEACHES.
01:06:39.929 I GET TO EAT, AND THAT FEELS GOOD TO BE ABLE TO EAT, BRINGING THE SUGAR DOWN, YOU'RE LOSING THE WEIGHT,
01:06:46.068 YOUR WHOLE EVERYTHING CHANGES. YOU KNOW, I THINK WE'RE A LITTLE DEPENDENT ON, YOU KNOW, OUR DOCTORS AND THE MEDICATIONS.
01:06:52.608 WE SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE BIT MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND CHECK IT OUT FOR OURSELVES. Fulkerson: AND SPEAKING OF DOCTORS AND MEDICATIONS,
01:06:58.781 HOW DOES SAN'DERA'S REGULAR PHYSICIAN FEEL ABOUT HER NEW LIFESTYLE? WHEN I RECENTLY APPROACHED HER
01:07:05.221 ABOUT MY BLOOD SUGARS BEING SO GREAT, MY QUESTION WAS, "SHOULD I NOT TAKE MY MEDICATION?"
01:07:14.130 SHE SAID, "NO, YOU STILL TAKE YOUR MEDICATIONS." AND SHE SAID, "WHAT IS THAT DOCTOR TRYING TO DO?
01:07:20.569 TAKE YOU OFF YOUR MEDICATIONS?" AND I'M LOOKING LIKE, "YEAH, I'M HOPING THAT'S THE...
01:07:27.643 THE GOAL." SO THERE'S STILL PEOPLE WE HAVE TO MAKE BELIEVERS, YEAH.
01:07:33.315 [laughs] - SALLY AND JIM EAT THEIR BREAKFAST AT ABOUT 7:00.
01:07:39.422 IT'S A GOOD BREAKFAST OF GOOD FOUNDATION FOODS. TODAY, THEY'RE HAVING MILK, CEREAL,
01:07:45.895 POACHED EGGS, AND SLICED ORANGES. THEY ARE STARTING THE DAY RIGHT. Fulkerson: THE KEY AGENCY THAT SETS
01:07:52.668 NUTRITIONAL GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS IS THE UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE.
01:07:57.940 THE U.S.D.A. HELPS DETERMINE WHAT FOODS ARE SERVED TO EVERYONE FROM OUR SOLDIERS IN THE FIELD
01:08:03.079 TO OUR KIDS IN THEIR SCHOOL CAFETERIAS. THESE GUIDELINES ARE ALSO TAUGHT IN OUR SCHOOLS,
01:08:09.185 INFLUENCING WHAT OUR CHILDREN WILL EAT FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES. DR. DAVID KLURFELD IS A NUTRITIONAL SCIENTIST
01:08:15.991 AND NATIONAL PROGRAM LEADER FOR HUMAN NUTRITION WITH THE U.S.D.A.'S AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH SERVICE.
01:08:22.564 - WE'VE MADE DIETARY RECOMMENDATIONS SINCE THE 1890s, FROM U.S.D.A. AND THAT WAS BEFORE WE KNEW ABOUT VITAMINS AND MINERALS.
01:08:30.339 SUBSEQUENTLY, WE'VE HAD DIFFERENT FOOD GROUPS, AND WE HAD THE BASIC 4
01:08:35.743 AND 5 AND 7 AND 12, AND IT VARIED AS THE SCIENCE CHANGED. Fulkerson: PERHAPS THE BEST KNOWN OF THE FOOD GROUPS
01:08:42.384 WAS THE "BASIC FOUR", INTRODUCED IN 1956 IN A LEAFLET CALLED "FOOD FOR FITNESS."
01:08:48.189 THE MAINSTAY OF NUTRITION EDUCATION FOR OVER 30 YEARS, THE BASIC FOUR DEFINED
01:08:53.429 WHAT AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF AMERICANS BELIEVED WAS HEALTHY TO EAT. THE FOUR FOOD GROUPS WAS REPLACED IN 1992
01:09:01.237 BY THE "FOOD PYRAMID," THEN UPDATED BY "MY PYRAMID." THESE GUIDELINES RECOMMEND
01:09:07.609 THREE SERVINGS OF DAIRY PRODUCTS PER DAY, AND MEAT IS STILL A PRIMARY SOURCE OF PROTEIN.
01:09:13.782 IN FOLLOWING "MY PYRAMID," A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL CAN EAT A DAILY MENU CONSISTING
01:09:19.555 OF A BOWL OF LUCKY CHARMS WITH LOW-FAT MILK AND A GLASS OF ORANGE JUICE FROM CONCENTRATE FOR BREAKFAST,
01:09:26.028 CHEESE-FLAVORED CRACKERS FOR A MORNING SNACK, A CHEESEBURGER ON A WHOLE-GRAIN BUN WITH FRENCH-FRIES AND A COKE FOR LUNCH,
01:09:32.801 CHOCOLATE PUDDING AND GRAPES FOR AN AFTERNOON SNACK, AND CHICKEN NUGGETS WITH A BISCUIT AND CANNED GREEN BEANS FOR DINNER
01:09:39.642 WITH LOW-FAT ICE CREAM FOR DESSERT. - I SEE NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WAY
01:09:46.482 THAT WE FEED MANY OF OUR CHILDREN IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED THAT WE'RE SEEING CHILDHOOD OBESITY
01:09:53.389 AT THE RATES THAT WE'RE SEEING IT. Fulkerson: DR. NEAL BARNARD IS A MEDICAL RESEARCHER AND PRESIDENT OF THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE
01:10:00.462 FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE. - WELL, THE PROBLEM IS, WHEN A KID IS PULLING HIS TRAY DOWN THE SCHOOL LUNCH LINE,
01:10:06.468 YOU SEE FEDERAL POLICIES IN ACTION. THERE ARE BURGERS TOPPED WITH CHEESE, THE MILK IS HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED.
01:10:13.008 BUT THE VEGETABLES AND FRUITS, A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO FIND. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS
01:10:18.113 ARE GOING TO PARTICULARLY THE MEAT PRODUCERS AND OTHER PRODUCERS AS WELL. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE HEALTH OF THE CHILDREN.
01:10:24.286 IT HAS ALL TO DO WITH THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE BIG AGRIBUSINESS ENTITIES.
01:10:29.425 - WHAT WE HAVE WITH THE U.S.D.A. IS IT'S REALLY A FARMERS ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION.
01:10:34.430 AND, OKAY LET'S HAVE ONE, BUT THAT SAME GROUP CANNOT ADVOCATE FOR FARMERS,
01:10:40.402 HELP SUBSIDIZE THEIR OPERATIONS, MANAGE COMMODITY FOODS, SUBSIDIZE THE PRICE OF GROWING THINGS,
01:10:46.909 AND THEN TURN AROUND AND SAY, "OKAY, WE'RE GOING TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO EAT." THEY'RE GOING TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT TO EAT BASED ON THEIR CONSTITUENTS,
01:10:52.881 WHICH ARE THE FARMERS, NOT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC. Fulkerson: IN 1998, BARNARD'S GROUP SUED THE U.S.D.A.
01:10:59.121 - EVERY FIVE YEARS, THE GOVERNMENT REFORMULATES THE DIETARY GUIDELINES FOR AMERICANS. THAT'S THE BLUEPRINT OF WHAT AMERICANS ARE SUPPOSED TO EAT
01:11:05.694 TO BE HEALTHY. AND WE LOOKED AT THE PANEL THAT PULLED IT TOGETHER--11 PEOPLE.
01:11:11.533 6 OF THE 11 HAD FINANCIAL RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE FOOD INDUSTRY. SO WE SAID, HEY, WAIT A MINUTE.
01:11:17.873 THERE ARE LAWS ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO AND HOW TRANSPARENT THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO BE. THEY VIOLATED THOSE.
01:11:23.846 AND WE BROUGHT THEM TO COURT, AND IT WAS A LONG TRIAL, BUT WE WON.
01:11:28.984 BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE FACT THAT THE POLICIES THEY CAME UP WITH CONTINUED TO FAVOR INDUSTRY AS THEY ALWAYS HAVE.
01:11:34.223 - I DON'T THINK THERE REALLY IS A PROBLEM WITH INDUSTRY CONNECTIONS BETWEEN SCIENTISTS
01:11:40.496 AND THE FOOD INDUSTRY, PRIMARILY BECAUSE IF THE BEEF INDUSTRY
01:11:45.968 HAS A QUESTION ABOUT THEIR PRODUCTS, SHOULDN'T THEY GO TO THE BEST SCIENTISTS?
01:11:51.840 AND IF THE BEST SCIENTISTS ARE CONSULTING FOR THE FOOD INDUSTRY, I STILL WANT THE BEST SCIENTISTS ON THESE COMMITTEES
01:12:01.016 THAT MAKE NUTRITIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS. FINANCIAL CONFLICT OF INTEREST IS ONLY ONE CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
01:12:08.324 YOU KNOW, THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE SPENT THEIR ENTIRE CAREERS TRYING TO PROVE THAT A VEGETARIAN DIET IS GOOD FOR YOU
01:12:15.097 OR THAT RED MEAT IS BAD FOR YOU. NOW, THEY MAY NOT HAVE INDUSTRY TIES, BUT THEY TOO HAVE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST.
01:12:22.104 - YOU KNOW, WE DO DEVELOP BIASES PERSONALLY. I HAD THOSE BIASES, TOO. BUT I GOT TO A POINT IN MY CAREER
01:12:29.511 THAT I WAS GETTING RESULTS THAT WENT AGAINST WHAT I HAD THOUGHT WAS TRUE. SO I HAD TO SELF-REFLECT, CRITICIZE MY OWN BIAS,
01:12:40.656 LOOK AT IT REALLY CAREFULLY, AND I CHANGED MY VIEWS. Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL PAID A PRICE FOR CHANGING HIS VIEWS.
01:12:47.863 HE'S BEEN MARGINALIZED BY KEY ADMINISTRATORS OF HIS OWN UNIVERSITY, THIS AFTER BEING A LEAD SCIENTIST
01:12:54.503 AND SECURING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN RESEARCH GRANTS FOR CORNELL'S NUTRITIONAL SCIENCES DIVISION.
01:13:00.075 HE HAD A POPULAR NUTRITION COURSE CANCELLED BY THE DIVISION DIRECTOR WHO HAD LONG BEEN A MAJOR CONSULTANT
01:13:05.381 TO THE DAIRY INDUSTRY. NUMEROUS OBSERVERS FEEL THIS WAS AN ARBITRARY DECISION
01:13:10.786 THAT VIOLATED THE STANDARDS OF ACADEMIC FREEDOM. DR. CAMPBELL HAS ALSO WITNESSED SERIOUS CORPORATE INFLUENCE
01:13:17.926 OVER RESEARCH THAT IS USED TO DEVELOP THE GOVERNMENT'S NUTRITION POLICY. ONE EXAMPLE HE CITES CENTERS ON
01:13:24.199 THE PRESTIGIOUS NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES. - THE BUILDING BEHIND ME HERE IS PERHAPS
01:13:30.139 THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT BUILDING IN THE AREA OF SCIENCE IN THE COUNTRY. THIS IS WHERE SCIENTISTS PARTICIPATE IN DELIBERATIONS
01:13:37.479 ABOUT ISSUES OF THE DAY AND DETERMINE HOW THAT SCIENCE CAN BE USED TO AFFECT POLICY.
01:13:43.185 IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN I WAS INVOLVED, THOSE PANELS WERE MOSTLY FUNDED BY PUBLIC MONEY.
01:13:48.724 BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, IN MORE RECENT YEARS, I HAVE SEEN MORE AND MORE CORPORATE MONEY
01:13:53.762 COMING IN TO SUPPORT THESE ACTIVITIES AND MORE AND MORE PEOPLE BEING ALLOWED ON THE COMMITTEES,
01:13:58.901 ESPECIALLY THE CHAIRS OF THE COMMITTEE. AND, OF COURSE, THEY CAN PICK THE KIND OF PEOPLE THEY WANT TO PICK
01:14:03.972 IN ORDER TO GET A CERTAIN KIND OF CONCLUSION. IT'S NOT THE WAY IT SHOULD BE, AND I'M SURE THAT IF THE PUBLIC WERE TO KNOW
01:14:09.344 HOW POWERFUL IS THIS INFLUENCE, THEY WOULD BE SURELY UPSET.
01:14:32.868 - I HAD BEEN A RUNNER FOR 14 YEARS, IN FACT, A MARATHONER. 47 YEARS OLD, THE TOP OF MY GAME.
01:14:40.209 Fulkerson: IN 1982, RUTH HEIDRICH'S RUNNING CAREER CAME TO A SUDDEN STOP WHEN SHE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER.
01:14:47.015 AFTER A MASTECTOMY, HER DOCTORS RECOMMENDED CHEMOTHERAPY AND RADIATION TO TREAT THE CANCER
01:14:52.621 THAT HAD BY THEN SPREAD TO HER LUNGS AND BONES. RUTH DECIDED TO VISIT DR. JOHN MCDOUGALL INSTEAD.
01:14:59.294 - AND I SAID, "RUTH, I SPENT MY RESIDENCY "COLLECTING INFORMATION ON DIET AND BREAST CANCER. "IT'S ALL IN THESE FILES RIGHT HERE.
01:15:05.934 "SIT IN MY OFFICE AND READ THROUGH IT AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK." - HE SAID, "THESE ARE THE STUDIES THAT SHOW--
01:15:11.073 "WHAT I'M TRYING TO PROVE IS THAT DIET CAN REVERSE BREAST CANCER."
01:15:16.311 - AND SHE READ IT, AND SHE COMES OUT AND SHE SAYS "OKAY, I'VE CHANGED MY DIET." SHE CHANGED HER DIET.
01:15:21.350 - SO HE SHOWED ME HOW TO EAT. NO ADDED OILS, LOTS OF FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, WHOLE GRAINS.
01:15:28.190 Fulkerson: RUTH THEN STARTED TRAINING FOR THE IRONMAN TRIATHLON IN HAWAII, WHICH COMBINES RUNNING A MARATHON
01:15:34.663 WITH LONG-DISTANCE BIKING AND SWIMMING. - I BECAME OBSESSED.
01:15:40.235 KEPT UP THE RUNNING, OF COURSE, NEVER STOPPED, AND THEN ADDED SWIMMING, BIKING, AND, FOR GOOD MEASURE, LIFTED WEIGHTS.
01:15:46.775 AND PEOPLE WERE SAYING, "YOU'RE CRAZY. YOU'RE A CANCER PATIENT. YOU SHOULD BE RESTING." DOCTORS TOLD ME THIS.
01:15:52.548 I FELT SO GOOD. I FELT FIT, AND I WANTED TO MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL OF FITNESS. AND I FELT SURE THAT IF I HAD A HEALTHY BODY
01:15:59.454 AND I WAS PUTTING THE RIGHT FOOD INTO IT THAT I COULD BEAT THIS CANCER.
01:16:05.294 Fulkerson: AT THE IRONMAN TRIATHLON, RUTH WON A GOLD MEDAL IN HER AGE GROUP.
01:16:11.934 - STUCK WITH THE DIET. FOUND OUT MY ARTHRITIS DISAPPEARED. MY CONSTIPATION DISAPPEARED.
01:16:17.506 MY DANDRUFF DISAPPEARED. NO SIGN OF DEPRESSION, WHICH YOU MIGHT EXPECT WITH A CANCER DIAGNOSIS.
01:16:23.679 I FELT RENEWED, INVIGORATED, AND OUT TO SHOW THAT DIET IS SO MUCH MORE IMPORTANT
01:16:31.353 THAN ANYBODY EVER THOUGHT. MMM! - OTHER WOMEN GET OVER BREAST CANCER,
01:16:36.959 COLON CANCER, PROSTATE CANCER. THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO'VE HAD METASTATIC PROSTATE CANCER ALL OVER THEIR BODY
01:16:42.164 WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH WHAT WE CALL SPONTANEOUS REMISSION. IN OTHER WORDS, THEY'VE BEEN CURED. AND IT'S NOT THE END OF THE WORLD
01:16:47.436 WHEN YOU GET THIS DIAGNOSIS. SOME PEOPLE GET OVER IT. RUTH DID.
01:16:52.441 - SO I'M STILL RACING. STILL DAILY TRAINING. NOW HOW MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR 70s ARE DOING TRIATHLONS?
01:16:59.648 NOT VERY MANY. SO THAT GIVES HOPE FOR ALL OF US AS WE AGE THAT NOT ONLY WILL YOU STAY HEALTHY
01:17:06.421 AND BEAT THE DEGENERATIVE DISEASES THAT MOST PEOPLE GET, BUT YOU CAN START COLLECTING MEDALS.
01:17:20.936 Fulkerson: THE FOOD CHOICES WE MAKE HAVE PROFOUND GLOBAL EFFECTS.
01:17:28.410 IT TAKES OVER TEN TIMES THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY FROM FOSSIL FUELS TO PRODUCE A CALORIE OF ANIMAL-BASED FOOD
01:17:34.383 THAN IT DOES TO PRODUCE A CALORIE OF PLANT FOOD. SINCE THE 1970s, 20% OF THE AMAZON'S RAINFOREST
01:17:41.423 HAS BEEN DESTROYED. THAT'S AN AREA THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA.
01:17:46.662 80% OF THIS CLEARED LAND IS NOW OCCUPIED BY LIVESTOCK.
01:17:51.800 THE WORLD'S CATTLE ALONE EAT ENOUGH GRAIN TO FEED 8.7 BILLION PEOPLE,
01:17:57.005 NEARLY 2 BILLION MORE THAN THE POPULATION ON EARTH. WITH ALMOST A BILLION MALNOURISHED PEOPLE
01:18:03.311 ACROSS THE GLOBE, REDIRECTING EVEN A PORTION OF THE GRAIN USED TO FATTEN CATTLE COULD FEED
01:18:09.551 EVERY HUNGRY MOUTH ON THE PLANET. FOR GENE BAUR, FACTORS LIKE THESE,
01:18:17.492 COMBINED WITH A DEEP RESPECT FOR ANIMALS, HELPED CONVINCE HIM TO ADOPT A PLANT-BASED DIET.
01:18:22.531 MR. BAUR IS PRESIDENT AND CO-FOUNDER OF FARM SANCTUARY NEAR WATKINS GLEN, NEW YORK.
01:18:28.837 IT PROVIDES A SAFE HAVEN FOR ANIMALS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR ABUSED. - I GREW UP EATING ANIMALS LIKE MOST PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY,
01:18:37.279 BUT ONCE I STARTED CONSIDERING MY FOOD CHOICES I RECOGNIZED THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO EAT ANIMALS.
01:18:43.185 AND THE MORE I LEARNED, THE MORE I SAW THAT I WAS HEALTHIER IF I DIDN'T EAT ANIMALS
01:18:49.458 AND THAT I HAD A MUCH LIGHTER FOOTPRINT ON OUR PLANET. THE LIVESTOCK INDUSTRY IS A GREATER CONTRIBUTOR TO GLOBAL WARMING THAN THE ENTIRE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY
01:18:55.931 ACCORDING TO THE UNITED NATIONS. SO BY EATING MEAT, MILK, AND EGGS THE WAY WE ARE,
01:19:01.570 WE'RE HARMING OUR OWN HEALTH, WE'RE SLAUGHTERING 10 BILLION INNOCENT ANIMALS
01:19:07.008 EVERY YEAR IN THE U.S., AND WE'RE DESTROYING THE PLANET. Fulkerson: STATISTICS COMPILED FROM THE UNITED NATIONS
01:19:12.981 AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEMONSTRATE THE PROFOUND GLOBAL EFFECT THAT DIET HAS ON HEALTH.
01:19:19.054 THESE ARE THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS OF ANIMAL FOODS PRODUCED IN NINE COUNTRIES, A FIGURE THAT'S CLOSELY RELATED TO ANIMAL FOOD CONSUMPTION.
01:19:27.462 THESE ARE THE NUMBERS OF DEATHS DUE TO HEART DISEASE AND CANCER IN THE SAME COUNTRIES.
01:19:35.871 IN THE UNITED STATES, THE VERY SAME DISEASES CONTINUE TO HAVE A GRAVE IMPACT.
01:19:41.309 EVEN WITH THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT ON CARDIAC TREATMENT, HEART DISEASE IS STILL THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH,
01:19:47.949 KILLING OVER 600,000 PEOPLE A YEAR. - AND THE ELEPHANT IN THE ROOM,
01:19:53.755 WHEN WE TALK ABOUT STENTS AND HEART BYPASS SURGERY, IS THE FACT THAT WHILE IT'S NO QUESTION
01:20:00.061 IN AN EMERGENCY, THESE PROCEDURES ARE ABSOLUTELY LIFESAVING. BUT WHEN THEY'RE DONE ELECTIVELY,
01:20:06.101 THESE PROCEDURES DO NOT PROTECT FROM NEW HEART ATTACKS. Fulkerson: STENTS AND BYPASS OPERATIONS
01:20:12.274 ARE USED MAINLY TO TREAT LARGE ARTERIAL BLOCKAGES. YET ACCORDING TO MANY RESEARCH STUDIES,
01:20:18.547 ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF HEART ATTACKS ARE CAUSED BY THE LARGEST BUILD-UPS OF PLAQUE.
01:20:23.752 THE REST ARE CAUSED BY THE MORE NUMEROUS, NEWER BLOCKAGES THAT ARE FAR MORE INFLAMED AND MUCH MORE LIKELY TO RUPTURE
01:20:30.192 THAN THE LARGER, OLDER, MORE STABLE PLAQUES. AND SO THIS IS WHY THOSE PROCEDURES
01:20:37.199 DON'T TREAT THE DISEASE. THEY ARE TREATING SYMPTOMS.
01:20:42.204 Fulkerson: DOCTOR ESSELSTYN HAS BEEN EATING THE SAME FOODS THAT HE HAS RECOMMENDED TO HIS PATIENTS FOR OVER 25 YEARS.
01:20:49.611 ONE OF HIS SONS, RIP ESSELSTYN, USED A PLANT-BASED DIET TO FUEL A SUCCESSFUL TEN-YEAR CAREER
01:20:55.617 AS A PROFESSIONAL TRI-ATHLETE. WHEN RIP TURNED 34, HE WAS READY FOR A CAREER CHANGE
01:21:01.623 AND TRAINED TO BECOME A FIREFIGHTER.
01:21:09.397 RIP WAS ASSIGNED TO ENGINE COMPANY NUMBER 2 IN AUSTIN, TEXAS. WE'RE INCREDIBLY COMPETITIVE HERE AT THE FIRE STATION,
01:21:17.572 AND WE LOVE MAKING BETS. SO WE WERE OUT ON THE PORCH ONE NIGHT, AND WE KIND OF MADE THIS LITTLE BAR BET
01:21:22.711 TO SEE WHO HAD THE LOWEST CHOLESTEROL LEVEL. SO THE NEXT MORNING, WE DROVE TO A LAB, GOT TESTED,
01:21:28.884 AND THE RESULTS CAME BACK. AND IT LEAD TO A DISCOVERY THAT J.R.,
01:21:33.922 JAMES RAY, OUR RESIDENT REDNECK, HAD A CHOLESTEROL OF 344. PRETTY MUCH MEANS YOU'RE KNOCKING AT DEATH'S DOOR.
01:21:40.495 AND SO WHAT WE DID, IN AN ACT OF SOLIDARITY, IS THE NEXT DAY WE WENT ABOUT EATING A PLANT-STRONG DIET,
01:21:48.069 TO BASICALLY SAVE HIS LIFE AND SAVE HIS ARTERIES. Fulkerson: THE MEN AGREED TO CHANGE THEIR FIREHOUSE DIET.
01:21:54.276 BUT IN TEXAS, OLD EATING HABITS DIE HARD. - MEAT'S ALMOST A SPORT IN TEXAS.
01:22:00.582 I HAVE SEVERAL GOOD FRIENDS THAT, THEY'RE BARBEQUE TEAMS. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THAT'S THEIR SPORT ON WEEKENDS.
01:22:05.987 - TEXANS ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THEIR BARBEQUE. - TEXAS, KANSAS. [alarm beeping]
01:22:16.598 [siren wailing] - WELL, GUYS ASSOCIATE BEING MANLY WITH EATING MEAT.
01:22:22.971 AND IF YOU'RE A FIREFIGHTER, IT'S EXPONENTIALLY SO. LAST YEAR, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE WERE 133 FIREFIGHTER FATALITIES
01:22:31.046 IN THE UNITED STATES. 52% WERE FROM HEART DISEASE.
01:22:36.685 OUR NUMBER ONE KILLER OF IN-THE-LINE-OF-DUTY DEATHS FOR FIREFIGHTERS IS HEART DISEASE.
01:22:42.090 Fulkerson: AFTER JUST THREE WEEKS ON HIS NEW DIET, J.R. TESTED HIS BLOOD CHOLESTEROL,
01:22:47.095 AND IT DROPPED 148 POINTS, A DECREASE OF 43%. HIS RESULTS INSPIRED THE OTHERS,
01:22:54.202 WHO ALSO SAW THEIR CHOLESTEROL DROP AND THEIR ENERGY LEVELS RISE. AS FIREMEN, THEY WERE NOT ONLY HELPING THEMSELVES,
01:23:01.476 THEY WERE IN BETTER SHAPE TO ASSIST OTHERS. - ONE OF THE THINGS ABOUT BEING A FIREFIGHTER
01:23:06.514 IS YOU DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT YOUR NEXT CALL COULD BE. WE MAY HAVE A HIGH-RISE ALARM, WHERE WE HAVE TO GO UP 20 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS
01:23:13.555 WITH AIR PACKS ON, WITH ALL OF OUR BUNKER GEAR ON, WITH A HIGH RISE PACK ON OUR BACKS.
01:23:19.127 ANYBODY CAN GO DOWN THE POLL, BUT NOT EVERYBODY CAN GO UP, ESPECIALLY WITHOUT THEIR LEGS.
01:23:24.399 AND RIGHT THERE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL 75 TO 100 POUNDS
01:23:29.938 THAT YOU HAVE TO CARRY UP 20 FLIGHTS OF STAIRS. YOU HAVE TO HAVE AN AMAZING AEROBIC CAPACITY AND STRENGTH IN ORDER TO DO THAT.
01:23:35.243 REAL...MEN...EAT...PLANTS. REAL...MEN...EAT...PLANTS.
01:23:42.884 [laughs] YOU KNOW WHAT, AS FIREFIGHTERS, EVERYBODY THINKS THAT WE FIGHT FIRE, AND WE DO.
01:23:51.326 BUT OVER 70% OF OUR CALLS ARE MEDICAL EMERGENCIES WHERE WE ARE RESPONDING TO HEART DISEASE,
01:23:58.199 HYPERTENSION, TYPE 2 DIABETES, RAMPANT OBESITY. AND SO WE SEE, UP CLOSE AND PERSONAL,
01:24:05.807 BASICALLY THE DESTRUCTION THAT'S BEING CAUSED BY THE STANDARD AMERICAN DIET. TO ME, THE ANSWER
01:24:12.113 IS JUST ABSOLUTELY SO SIMPLE, IT'S CRIMINAL. IT'S JUST PEOPLE STARTING TO TAKE
01:24:17.152 RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR HEALTH AND STARTING TO EAT MORE PLANT-BASED FOODS.
01:24:22.223 IT'S THAT SIMPLE. Fulkerson: AFTER 13 WEEKS ON A WHOLE FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET,
01:24:30.165 IT WAS TIME TO GET MY RESULTS FROM DR. LEDERMAN. - WHEN YOU STARTED, YOUR WEIGHT WAS 231, 231 POUNDS,
01:24:37.238 NOW 211 POUNDS. - OKAY, THAT'S GOOD. - IT'S A 20-POUND DROP THERE. - WOW. - YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE WAS 142 OVER 82 WHEN YOU STARTED.
01:24:44.179 IT'S NOW 112 OVER 70. - WOW. THAT'S A BIG DROP. - THAT'S A NICE DROP. OH, YEAH, THAT'S--
01:24:49.284 THAT'S GREAT, AND, UH, IT'LL JUST KEEP GETTING... IT'LL KEEP DROPPING AS YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS. YOUR PULSE WAS RESTING AT 92 WHEN YOU STARTED.
01:24:57.125 IT'S NOW DOWN TO 60, RESTING. - OKAY, COOL. - YOUR TOTAL CHOLESTEROL THOUGH WENT FROM 241 DOWN TO 154.
01:25:05.967 - WHAT? - [laughs] YEAH, THAT WAS PRETTY AMAZING. 241 DOWN TO 154.
01:25:11.372 - 154? - 154, YEAH, THAT'S REALLY-- AND YOUR LDL, WHICH IS YOUR BAD CHOLESTEROL-- UM, I THINK THIS IS THE MOST IMPRESSIVE--
01:25:18.847 WENT FROM 157 DOWN TO 80. - NO WAY! - YEAH. THAT'S AMAZING THAT IT DROPPED ALMOST IN HALF.
01:25:25.687 UH, WE DID C.R.P. LAST TIME, WHICH IS SORT OF THE MARKER OF THE INFLAMMATION IN THE HEART AND THE BLOOD VESSELS.
01:25:30.925 AND THAT WENT FROM 6.0 DOWN TO 2.8. Fulkerson: WITHOUT USING ANY MEDICATIONS,
01:25:37.232 I SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED MY CHANCES OF GETTING A HEART ATTACK AND MANY OTHER DISEASES.
01:25:45.406 - TOMORROW MARKS 20 WEEKS ON THE PROGRAM. I'VE LOST 45 POUNDS.
01:25:50.578 I'VE REVERSED THE DIABETES. - YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT EVERYBODY IS SO INCREDIBLY PROUD OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE.
01:25:56.718 - I DON'T HAVE TO RELY ON THE MEDICATION. I HAVE A LOT OF ENERGY THAT I DIDN'T HAVE BEFORE. MY CHILDREN LOVE IT.
01:26:04.459 THEY'RE SO PROUD OF ME, AND THEY TELL ME ALL THE TIME. I HAD A LITTLE SAYING THAT I'VE CARRIED AROUND FOR MAYBE THE LAST TWO YEARS.
01:26:11.466 AND IT'S "WIN THE WAR. "DO NOT LET ONE LOST BATTLE END THE WAR. "IF YOU DO BREAK DOWN AND GIVE INTO TEMPTATION, DO NOT QUIT.
01:26:19.340 "JUST GET RIGHT BACK ON TRACK. NOT TOMORROW, BUT RIGHT NOW." THE DIABETES IS NOT COMING BACK.
01:26:25.046 I'M NOT GONNA LET IT COME BACK, NOR THE WEIGHT. THE MESSAGE IS, YOU'RE IN CONTROL OF YOUR LIFE.
01:26:30.451 Fulkerson: JOEY AUCOIN HAD OVER TWO DOZEN HEALTH PROBLEMS, INCLUDING TYPE 2 DIABETES.
01:26:36.691 BUT AFTER 22 WEEKS EATING PLANT-BASED FOODS, HIS CONDITION HAD CHANGED DRAMATICALLY.
01:26:42.564 - HEY, HOW YOU DOIN'? - BACK AGAIN. - AND YOU'RE GETTING HEALTHIER. YOUR WEIGHT IS DOWN 28 POUNDS.
01:26:48.536 YOU FEEL BETTER THAN YOU HAVE. 26 OUT OF 27 COMPLAINTS ARE GONE COMPLETELY.
01:26:54.142 YOUR MARKER OF INFLAMMATION IN THE VESSELS IS DOWN TO THAT OF A NORMAL PERSON. UH, YOUR BLOOD SUGARS ARE COMING DOWN.
01:27:00.782 THEY CONTINUE TO COME DOWN EVEN ON A DAILY BASIS, WHICH ARE GONNA GET BETTER. YOUR CHOLESTEROL IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER
01:27:05.954 THAN IT WAS WHEN YOU FIRST STARTED, BEFORE YOU EVER STARTED TAKING ANY PILLS. YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE IS NORMAL NOW,
01:27:11.359 COMPARED TO HOW IT WAS BEFORE WHILE ON PILLS. IT WAS STILL ELEVATED. AND YOU JUST-- YOU KNOW, YOU JUST SAID
01:27:17.498 YOU'VE NEVER FELT LIKE THIS BEFORE. YOU LOOK--LOOK AT HOW YOU LOOK IN THE PICTURES. YOU LOOK HEALTHIER. SO, YOU KNOW, LIKE I TOLD YOU BEFORE,
01:27:23.571 I EXPLAINED HOW THE NUMBERS CAN AFFECT-- CAN AFFECT OUR JUDGMENT OF WHAT REAL HEALTH IS. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE NUMBERS.
01:27:29.010 IT'S OVERALL THE ENTIRE PICTURE, AND YOUR PICTURE LOOKS FANTASTIC. - I WAS TAKIN' NINE PILLS A DAY AND TWO SHOTS.
01:27:34.816 I WAS SPENDING ALMOST A 150 TO 200 A MONTH ON MEDICATION, ABOVE MY INSURANCE. JUST THINK ABOUT THAT: I'VE BEEN DOIN' IT FIVE MONTHS.
01:27:41.923 I'VE SAVED, YOU KNOW, $800 TO A $1000 ALREADY, 'CAUSE I HAVEN'T TAKEN ONE PILL, ONE SHOT.
01:27:47.595 SO THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT SAVED ME-- NOT JUST ME, THE INSURANCE COMPANY. - THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL GIVE YOU FIGURES THAT 75% OF THE DOLLARS SPENT IN HEALTH CARE
01:27:56.371 ARE DUE TO CHRONIC ILLNESSES, AND THESE ARE DUE TO DIET AND LIFESTYLE. LET'S GET RID OF THE PROBLEM, WHICH IS THE SICKNESS WHICH IS CAUSED BY THE FOOD.
01:28:05.813 [cow moos]
01:28:14.489 Fulkerson: NOW WELL INTO THEIR 70s, DOCTORS CAMPBELL AND ESSELSTYN ARE BOTH VITAL AND ACTIVE.
01:28:22.363 THEY ALSO CONTINUE TO SPREAD THEIR MESSAGE. - IF YOU CAREFULLY LOOK AT OUR SCHOOL CHILDREN,
01:28:27.769 ALREADY THE ARTERIES TO THEIR BRAIN, THEIR CAROTID ARTERY, IS GETTING SOME INTIMAL MEDIAL THICKENING.
01:28:34.475 Fulkerson: DR. ESSELSTYN LECTURES ABOUT HIS RESEARCH ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.
01:28:39.881 HIS WIFE ANN FREQUENTLY ACCOMPANIES HIM TO HELP COUNCIL PATIENTS AND TO DEMONSTRATE THE PREPARATION
01:28:45.353 OF PLANT-BASED FOODS. DR. ESSELSTYN IS ALSO DIRECTOR OF THE CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE PREVENTION AND REVERSAL PROGRAM
01:28:52.894 AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC'S WELLNESS INSTITUTE. LIKE DR. ESSELSTYN, DR. CAMPBELL
01:28:59.967 CONTINUES TO LECTURE THROUGHOUT AMERICA AND BEYOND. - DR. CAMPBELL, YOU BELIEVE THAT EVEN IF ANIMAL-BASED PROTEINS,
01:29:06.607 MEAT, DAIRY, ET CETERA-- ARE FREE FROM CONTAMINATION, YOU DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD EAT THEM?
01:29:12.113 - NO, I DON'T. I THINK THE CLOSER WE GET TO A PLANT-BASED DIET-- I SHOULD SAY A WHOLE-FOODS, PLANT-BASED DIET,
01:29:18.953 THE HEALTHIER WE'RE GOING TO BE FOR ALL OF US. Fulkerson: IN CHINA, WHERE DR. CAMPBELL
01:29:25.259 DID HIS LARGE STUDY A GENERATION AGO, THE POPULATION HAS EXPERIENCED DRAMATIC INCREASES
01:29:30.365 IN THE AMOUNT OF MEAT, DAIRY, AND PROCESSED FOODS THE AVERAGE PERSON CONSUMES. AT THE SAME TIME,
01:29:36.704 THE RATES OF DEGENERATIVE DISEASES ARE SKYROCKETING. MANY CHINESE NOW SHARE SOME OF THE SAME BELIEFS
01:29:43.077 AMERICANS HAVE ABOUT NUTRITION.
01:29:56.424 Fulkerson: DR. CAMPBELL'S MESSAGE IS RESONATING WITH GROWING NUMBERS OF CONCERNED PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD.
01:30:02.130 - THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. Fulkerson: THANKS TO THE EFFORTS OF BOTH THESE PIONEERS
01:30:07.802 AND THEIR COLLEAGUES, THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ARE REALIZING THAT PROFOUND IMPROVEMENTS IN HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE ARE WITHIN REACH.
01:30:16.110 - YOU HAVE TWO CHOICES: YOU CAN EAT YOURSELF INTO POOR HEALTH AND EARLY DEATH,
01:30:23.151 OR YOU CAN EAT YOURSELF INTO GOOD HEALTH AND A LONG, HEALTHY LIFE.
01:30:28.756 AND THAT ROAD IS ON A PLANT- CENTERED DIETARY PATTERN.
01:30:33.761 - YOU KNOW, I KNOW OF NOTHING ELSE IN MEDICINE THAT CAN COME CLOSE TO WHAT A PLANT-BASED DIET CAN DO.
01:30:40.568 I CAN SAY THIS WITH A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE, THAT OUR NATIONAL AUTHORITIES ARE SIMPLY EXCLUDING
01:30:46.040 THIS CONCEPT OF NUTRITION FROM THE DEBATE AND THE DISCUSSION IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO. IN THEORY, IF EVERYONE WERE TO ADOPT THIS,
01:30:53.981 I REALLY BELIEVE WE COULD CUT HEALTH CARE COSTS BY 70% TO 80%. THAT'S AMAZING.
01:30:59.253 AND IT ALL COMES FROM UNDERSTANDING NUTRITION, APPLYING NUTRITION, AND JUST WATCHIN' THE RESULTS.
01:31:13.134 - THE GREATEST GIFT THAT YOU COULD POSSIBLY GIVE TO YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY, NOT ONLY THOSE IN YOUR GENERATION,
01:31:20.441 BUT YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR GRANDCHILDREN, IF YOU CAN MAKE THEM BE AWARE
01:31:25.513 OF THE INCREDIBLE POWER THAT RESIDES WITHIN EACH OF THEM TO AVOID LIFE'S MOST POIGNANTLY TRAGIC AND PAINFUL EVENTS,
01:31:34.388 YOU JUST DON'T HAVE TO HAVE THOSE KINDS OF EVENTS. - I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL MY HEART,
01:31:40.094 IF ANYONE LISTEN TO THIS, AND THEY REALLY SHOULD LOOK AT THEIR REFRIGERATOR,
01:31:45.433 AND LOOK AT THEIR DIET, AND GIVE A TRY. YOU LOSE WEIGHT, AND YOU'LL BE HEALTHIER.
01:31:50.872 NOTHING COULD LOSE IF YOU JUST TAKE FEW WEEKS AND TRY. YOU COULD SEE HOW EASY IT IS.
01:31:57.812 - I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT WAS DIFFICULT. AGAIN, I MADE UP MY MIND, THIS IS WHAT I'M GOING TO DO.
01:32:02.884 I NEVER FELT LIKE I WASN'T GETTING WHAT I WANTED. SO I DIDN'T HAVE ICE CREAM, SO I DIDN'T HAVE THE DOUGHNUTS,
01:32:08.689 SO I ATE SOMETHING ELSE. - I CAN THANK THEM IN EVERY WAY I CAN THINK POSSIBLE, AND MY DOCTOR, ESPECIALLY MATT,
01:32:14.529 AND THEY JUST CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHAT IT'S DONE TO CHANGE MY LIFE. AND IT REALLY HAS. NOT JUST MINE, MY FAMILY'S, EVERYBODY'S.
01:32:20.568 IT GIVES ME SHIVERS TALKING ABOUT IT, BECAUSE IT'S SO SERIOUS. IT'S A LIFE-CHANGING EXPERIENCE.
01:32:25.907 - YOU CAN BE IN CONTROL, AND I STRESS THIS, 'CAUSE THERE'S SO MANY THINGS GOING ON IN MY LIFE THAT I'M NOT IN CONTROL OF.
01:32:32.480 AND THAT'S MY MESSAGE. YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR OUTCOME OF YOUR BODY. EAT TO LIVE AND DON'T LIVE TO EAT.
01:32:41.389 - YOU BETTER GET THAT. YOU BETTER GET THE RECIPE. - [laughs] - THIS IS GOOD.
