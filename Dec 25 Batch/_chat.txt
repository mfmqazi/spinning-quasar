Welcome all to this health group! The purpose of this group is to empower you to take control of your health and, ideally, reduce or eliminate the need for medications used to manage lifestyle-related diseases. This will be achieved through education on a Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, active living, Intermittent Fasting (IF), and a therapeutic fasting-based lifestyle.

My Introduction:
Many members may not know me, so let me introduce myself.

My name is Lalit M. Kapoor, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area—specifically in Berkeley. I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1971 and moved to UCLA in 1973 to complete my MBA. I’ve been living in the U.S. ever since.

After successfully selling the companies I started, I retired from business in 2005. Since then, I have pursued health and anti-aging research as a personal passion.

Twelve years ago, I watched the documentary Forks Over Knives, which deeply resonated with me. I was inspired to adopt the PBWF lifestyle recommended by several doctors featured in the film. Within 18 months, I lost 50 pounds and discontinued five prescription medications. Conditions I overcame include diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, gout, sleep apnea, and seasonal allergies. I felt more energetic than I had in decades—even completing my first half-marathon.

In 2017, I created a WhatsApp group for my 1971 IITK batchmates to share my experience. Many reported similar results and successfully reduced or eliminated their medications. As the group grew through referrals, I went on to create over 600 health groups and have coached more than 300,000 members.

Based on that experience and continued learning and new research in the fields of nutrition and health, I’ve fine-tuned my recommendations. Many members now see improvement within just two weeks. Your progress will depend on your medical history and how consistently you follow the guidance. I made my changes at age 63; others have seen results even at 85. I’ll share their stories with you along the way.

I will be assisted by Meenakshi Nigam in posting regular content and coaching you through this journey. We will also share short videos and lectures by leading doctors and professors from institutions like UCSF, USC, and Cleveland Clinic. Most videos are 5–10 minutes, with a few longer talks. I strongly encourage you to watch them, as my posts will be brief and may not cover every detail. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words; a video is worth a thousand pictures.

You’ll have the opportunity to ask questions, but based on experience, many early questions are answered in subsequent posts. For that reason, Q&A sessions will begin after the first two weeks and occur once per week. During this time, member posting will be paused and reopened periodically for questions.

During the first three weeks the focus will be on:
• What to eat and what not to eat
• When to eat and when not to eat
• How to cook and eat mindfully
• How to detoxify our body
• Physical activity
• Emotional Health
• Spiritual Health

During fourth week we will cover the political landscape of the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, and explore the influence of government and media.

Beginning this month the course has been split into two modules. The second module which focusses on Chronic diseases will be offered separately beginning November.  

As the course progresses, many members begin to see health improvements and share their stories. Most people who follow the guidance are able to discontinue some or most of their medications within months—especially those with hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. While some conditions lack clear metrics, it is difficult to assess progress. Most members report feeling younger and more energetic. 

It is highly recommended that members of the group share the posts with their spouses and watch the videos and documentaries together. The enrollment in WhatsApp groups has now stopped, please don’t send any requests for adding members. I start a new group every month. 

Past participants report spending 45–60 minutes daily during the first month, reading posts and watching videos. At the end of the one month program, you will be invited to join a geographically organized group of alumni for continued activities and support.

While we waited for others to join, I recommended you watch Forks Over Knives. If you haven’t, please do so immediately. Also, watch its companion documentary Forks Over Knives: Extended Interviews. I will post a list of other documentaries soon.

If you are seriously ill or facing urgent medical decisions please consult your physician. 
Please do not contact me directly. All questions should be asked in the group. With many groups and thousands of members running in parallel—including repeat participants—I ask that everyone follow the group’s pace and not skip ahead.

Thank you.

[12/1/25, 8:54:57 AM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (1)

By definition, a myth is "a widely held but false belief or idea." Where do they originate? Most myths are historical and long-held beliefs debunked with scientific knowledge gained through the advancement of science. However, in the modern world of social media, many myths can be intentionally implanted and quickly spread. Sometimes, even in the presence of evidence to the contrary, some myths continue to be propagated by vested interests.

Myth: HUMANS EVOLVED AS HUNTERS
Humans evolved as primates about 65 million years ago. Then, around 7 million years ago, we separated from Chimpanzees to Homonins with large brains and smaller teeth and bipedality. Homosapiens evolved about 2 million years ago. As humans evolved, most lived in temperate climates where there was an abundance of fresh produce throughout the year. The control over fire was only achieved about 400 thousand years ago. Prior to that, cooking was not an option. The idea of consuming raw meat in the presence of fresh fruits and vegetables seems unimaginable. Once we controlled fire it is safe to assume people might have moved into the temperate climate zones of Western civilizations, where winters are cold, and food does not grow for 6 months in a year, so societies evolved out of necessity to become meat eaters.
Also, until we evolved into the Bronze Age, there were not any tools available for hunting. Can you imagine hunting a buffalo or even a goat or deer with stones? Early humans were more likely to be gatherers and scavengers as opposed to hunters. In addition, human physiology with long intestines and a small jaw and teeth structure suggests that we evolved eating plant-based diets.

FRESHWATER FISH
The only exception appears to be that of freshwater fish. As we moved from one place to another in search of food, we must have camped at places near freshwater. Fish were not so difficult to catch even in the Stone Age. Fish in its raw form is also not intolerable to our palate, as many  who eat Japanese Sushi would attest.

HUMAN SETTLEMENTS 
As humans started farming and domesticating animals, we must have started consuming animal milks, eggs, and meat. Eating a cooked masala omelet is much more palatable than raw eggs. The only food processing we were familiar with was peeling, chopping, grinding, mashing, shredding, etc. The concept of ultra-processed food really came into existence during the last century with industrialization. The necessity of feeding soldiers during the two World Wars led to the evolution of food processing and packaging industries. After the wars were over these food companies, with their excess capacities, started marketing more and more ultra-processed foods to the masses.

Myth: TAKE A PILL WHEN ILL
The belief that when you are sick, you should take medicine, and the disease will go away started with the discovery of antibiotics 100 years ago. At the time, most dreaded diseases we faced were infectious diseases like Cholera, Typhoid, Smallpox, Polio, etc. The discovery of the antibiotic Penicillin in 1928 worked like a charm for such diseases. Over the years that followed, we as a society got accustomed to the idea of taking a pill when ill.

POST WORLD WAR 2 ERA
In the late 1940s, after the World Wars were over, Western governments ensured that food was inexpensive and plentiful. People had suffered food shortages for three decades due to depression and wars. Food got subsidized and even the poor started eating like kings. Chronic diseases, which earlier only affected the rich, became common. With the “take a pill when ill” psyche, it was natural for us to expect miracle drugs from our doctors, and they, along with the pharmaceutical industry, were quick to oblige. However, this time, the drugs did not cure the diseases so the doctors came up with the new explanation that lifestyle diseases are not curable, and doctors can only help manage them by keeping the symptoms in check through lifelong medications.

DISENCHANTMENT AMONG DOCTORS
Some doctors, who entered the medical field with a sincere desire to help humanity by curing diseases, slowly became disenchanted and started looking for answers elsewhere. They observed that, just like the wild animals of today and our ancestors of 10,000 years ago, all mammal’s organisms were self-healing, and symptoms were a natural compensatory response of the body. In a sense, symptoms are the messengers giving us clues that everything is not alright. 


By taking medications to suppress the symptoms we are only interfering with the body’s self-healing mechanism.

ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD
Another observation was that over the years, the profit motive of the food industry had changed the nature of food to refined and ultra-processed food-like products that bore little resemblance to food as we knew it. To increase shelf life fiber was removed and, to increase sales, taste was improved by adding sugar and oils. Experts with PhDs in psychology were deployed to make food taste addictive and non-satiating so people would eat more and buy more. These ultra-processed foods, in fact, were (a) increasing the toxicity of the body and (b) creating deficiencies of nutrients.
In addition, the use of inorganic fertilizers and single-crop farming depleted the soil of trace minerals. The produce, though sumptuous and beautiful looking, lacked nutrients, especially micronutrients. Damming rivers to generate hydropower did not help either. As minerals settle down upstream, in the lakes created by dams, it further depletes the soil of trace minerals. Processed and refined foods are not only deficient in nutrients but also full of preservatives. To reduce cost and increase profits, new inexpensive products like hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrups were developed. Deficiencies of nutrients reduce the body’s immunity making it more susceptible to diseases. The abundance of animal food, which was only available to kings and aristocrats earlier, was now available to the masses and caused havoc with their health.
Finally, this new breed of doctors started to speak out, but their voices were muffled by the powerful lobby of the food, drug, and healthcare industries and the government, eager to please lobbyists with deep pockets. The Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement is the outgrowth of these pioneering voices.

WHAT IS A PBWF DIET?
A Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, as the name implies, consists of following:
- Only plant-based foods. No animal foods, no fish, eggs, or dairy. No butter or ghee.
- No Refined or ultra-processed foods. No sugar or vegetable oils or refined flours. Take corn for example: Corn on the cob, Corn Soup, Corn Starch and Corn Flour would be considered whole foods. Corn Flakes, Corn Oil  and High Fructose Corn Syrup would be considered Ultra-processed foods.

This concept of food as holistic medicine dates back to the period of Hippocrates who said, "let food be thy medicine." Hippocrates may have acquired this knowledge at Takshshila University of India: the world’s largest center of learning at the time. The latest research shows us that when you change your diet to plant based ehole food, your body begins to heal naturally and when your body heals, everything heals, including lifestyle diseases. This is the main theme of this blog as you will see in the weeks to come.

[12/1/25, 7:38:01 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: New Year Resolutions That Are Bound to Fail

On January 1, many of you are likely to have made resolutions to join the gym and start working out in new year. Food, along with its timing (as in circadian rhythm) and its absence (as in fasting), is the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and we often fail to recognize it. Physical exercise accounts for only 10-15% of our health yet we are completely enamored by it. What is the reason for such a disconnect?

Myth: IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT (You Are Eating Too Much and Not Exercising Enough)
These words have been repeated by doctors and our elders often referred to as "gluttony and sloth." Have you ever wondered why all mammals in the wild world don't have this problem and we humans didn't have it until a century ago? Wild animals eat as much as they’d like  as often as they’d like. A deer doesn't need a dietitian to dictate its diet. The reason we struggle might be simple: we are eating the wrong foods. The ultraprocessed foods we consume are designed for overconsumption by PhDs in psychology, circumventing our satiation mechanism.

FLAWED NUTRITION SCIENCE
Nutrition science, as it has evolved over the past century, has gone in the wrong direction of reductionism. Looking at nutrition as individual nutrients and ensuring we get enough by supplementing them worsen the situation. This approach has led to a population where the number of sick people outweighs that of healthy people. Nutrients in food work like a symphony, and focusing on individual nutrients turns a harmonious body into chaos.

ULTRA PROCESSED FOOD
The profit motive of the food industry has resulted in an increasing amount of ultra-processed food that is both addictive and non-satiating, circumventing human satiation mechanisms. Additionally, calorie-dense and nutrient-poor food is prevalent. Soil depletion due to organized farming and damming of rivers has not helped either giving rise to a profitable supplements industry.

Our body is impacted not only by known nutrients but also by nutrients we have not yet discovered. Consuming natural foods provides us with a package of known and not-yet-known nutrients. Supplements, on the other hand, only offer the nutrients we know about. We are not overeating by choice; the problem lies in the food we consume. Someone profits from it, and we find ourselves captive to it.

Another fact, studied by Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF, is that when insulin levels are high (common when overeating refined foods), our body wants to conserve energy and avoids physical activity. It's not our fault that we don't want to exercise; it's a result of ultra-processed foods. We are not the problem - the problem is ultra-processed food.

I will be debunking many such myths that lead us to failure and worsen our health in my course You will learn what I call the Five Pillars of Health, a blueprint for wellbeing that, when followed, can rejuvenate your health and make you feel years younger.

[12/1/25, 7:38:02 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (2)

MYTH: EAT EVERYTHING IN MODERATION
These are “words of wisdom” often uttered by many respectable people including our elders and doctors. The problem with this advice is that when we consume everything in moderation, we also get diseases in moderation. This myth is so pervasive in our society that we have come to expect old age diseases as normal part of aging. What if we are wrong? In fact, we are wrong and it was proven 24 years ago when National Geographic commissioned a study with Dan Buettner, widely known as the Blue Zone Study.

Blue Zone Study
Dan Buettner identified five communities worldwide with the longest living people: Okinawa (Japan), Sardinia (Italy), Icaria (Greece), Nicoya (Costa Rica) and Loma Linda (California, USA). These places showcased individuals living to 100-105 years without the prevalence of lifestyle diseases associated with old age.
Lessons learnt from these zones include a simple lifestyle, absence of modern processed foods, and daily activities involving over 10,000 steps. 

OUR ANCESTORS LIFE

Our ancestors in India really did not live long lives. I remember in the 1950’s, if someone lived beyond 75-80 years, his death was celebrated as a life well lived. Today, at the age of 74, I shudder at that thought. 

How Many Diseases?
Estimates suggest around 10,000 diseases afflict humans, and the field of medical sciences continues to specialize with over 135 medical specialties. The lack of centralized monitoring for medications prescribed by specialists adds complexity to addressing negative side effects and adverse drug reactions.

MYTH: DIFFERENT DIETS FOR DIFFERENT DISEASES
Most people have a belief that there must be a different diet plan recommendation for different illnesses. The most common question asked in my health groups is “I suffer from X, Y and Z. What should I eat?”  Food should be healthy to prevent all diseases, if not, it would create an unresolvable dilemma as to what diseases should I treat and which ones suffer. This is likely one or the biggest myth of all and is continuously propagated by many dietitians, doctors, naturopaths and health spas. Just imagine you are suffering from diseases X, Y and Z and you are prescribed the following diet:

-For disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P
-For disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R and avoid  C, G, M, S & Q
-For disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S and avoid  A, G, K, P & T

How would you figure out what to eat and what to avoid? The premise that there is a special diet for every disease is fundamentally flawed. When you eat a Plant Based Whole Food diet, with a diverse variety of foods in each food group, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and it heals. And when body heals everything heals. 

Self Selection
When we look around in wilderness we find that animals living there eat whatever they want whenever they want and as much as they want. Why are humans are incapable of doing that? Why do we have to consult a dietitian to find out what to eat, what not to eat, how much to eat and when to eat it? During the 1930s many studies were done on this subject of self selection and it was found that, over an extended period of time, animals were able to self select their food choices in a way that their bodies remained healthy without creating any deficiency or excesses. One such study done in Canada in the 1930s on young children found that over a period of 6 months when children were left to themselves to select their food, from a buffet of varied choices, they did fine and there were no deficiencies or excesses. It was concluded that among young children the process of self selection works fine. 

So the question arises as to why we lose this innate ability to self select our own food. The answer lies in the fact that we human are social animals and as we grow up our decisions are based on more than physiology. We start consuming foods not necessarily because we find them tasty and rewarding but also because they fulfill our psychological needs: to show off, feel grown up or to belong to a certain clique. Many addictions like tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco start that way. Nobody likes these at first and many find their taste and feel unpleasant. 

Designer Foods 
Some foods are designed in ways to create a dopamine response that we find rewarding like refined fat and sugar. Even these foods, if not tinkered with by specialists, are likely to satiate us quickly and not lead to much overconsumption. However, when foods are designed by expert psychologists who know how to circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism we fall prey to them, wanting to eat more and more. The best example to make this point is potato chips. When you make them at home you can’t eat more than a dozen or so without feeling satiated. When you eat Pringles chips you can keep eating one after another until the box is empty. In fact, the company took pride in that and their advertising tag line was “Once you pop, you can't stop.” It is important to take conscious approach to our dietary choices.

Diet Alone is Not the Solution
Similarly looking for all solutions in diet alone is also a flawed approach and needs correction. Recent research and Nobel prizes awarded in 2016, 2017 and 2018 have shown that when to eat (as in Circadian Rhythm) and when not to eat (as in fasting) are often equally important. In addition, the new science of microbes colonizing our colon called Epigenetics is creating a paradigm shift in our understanding of nutrition and diseases. Its impact is still not well understood but we are getting many clues. 

Many people do not follow lifestyle recommendations like intermittent fasting or Ekadashi fasting or Navratri fasting which are essential for detoxifying the body. Also many people eat late dinners (after it is dark outside) and go to bed shortly thereafter. These lifestyle choices impact our health in ways we are only beginning to understand. 

In the coming weeks we will delve into lifestyle choices, like fasting, and their impact on health. Stay tuned.

[12/1/25, 7:38:02 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Myth: HUMANS ARE VERY SIMILAR

It's been commonly assumed in medical research that all humans are similar, and therefore, findings from a small group can be generalized across the population, aside from racial and socioeconomic variations. Humans are indeed genetically similar, which underpins the belief that clinical studies on one group are applicable to others if they share racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of the recent studies have shattered this myth beyond doubt beginning with Human Genome Project.  

Human Genome Project (1990-2003)
This project involved six of the world's wealthiest countries, including the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, France, and the UK. The U.S. alone invested 3 billion dollars in the project, which aimed to map an individual's genome and predict their medical future, similar to a medical horoscope. However, the results revealed a surprising complexity, with human genes outnumbering expectations by a hundredfold. The mystery unraveled when it was discovered that the human body contains about 38 trillion foreign cells, mainly microbes in the colon, outnumbering its own 37 trillion human cells. These microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, constitute our microbiota, with their genetic material forming our microbiome, significantly influenced by our diet and lifestyle.

Human Microbiome Project (2007 - Present)
To study the effects of bacteria on our health another project was undertaken in 2007 called the Human Microbiome Project. This resulted in a major shift in how we perceive and address health problems. For example we learned that:
1. Identical twins can be as much as 70% apart due to changes in their diet and lifestyle. 
2. The same cause can manifest as different symptoms among different people.
3. The same symptoms can stem from different causes in different people.
4. Diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science, often with hits and misses.

This new science is creating a whole new field of fecal transplantation. For example studies have shown that a fecal transplantation from a slim mouse into the colon of a fat mouse can make it lose weight easily within months. This is an active frontier in medical science today. 


Epigenetics was featured on the cover of TIME magazine in January 2010. A helpful way to grasp the distinction between genetics and epigenetics is to think of it in terms of a mobile phone's hardware and its application software. Essentially, the hardware in all mobile phones is quite similar regardless of the manufacturer. Yet, the phone's functionality and appearance can vary significantly depending on the software it runs. In a similar vein, while our genetic makeup (like the phone's hardware) is fundamentally the same, epigenetics (akin to the software) determines how these genes are expressed, leading to notable differences from one individual to another.

American Gut Project (2013-2018)
Another project, the American Gut Project, started in 2013, analyzed gut microbiome data from people from 45 countries. The findings released in 2018 unveiled many surprises. The study divided people into two groups—one consuming 10 or less plant-based foods and the other consuming over 30 different plant food varieties. The study found that the first group suffered from many metabolic diseases and had low immunity, while the second group had few diseases and rarely suffered from viral infections.

Myth: IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT (Overeating and Lack of Exercise)
When we visit a doctor and our first lifestyle disease is diagnosed (generally high Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, or Cholesterol), the doctors put the blame squarely on us saying “You are eating too much and not exercising enough" commonly referred to as "gluttony and sloth." The doctors don’t explain why we are doing so; it's not taught to them in medical colleges.
The reason is simple: we are eating the wrong foods. Ultraprocessed foods are designed for overconsumption by Ph.D.s in psychology. They circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism. 
I remember the night Al Gore lost US presidential election to Bush in November 2000, I was in Mumbai and bought a pint of Mumbai’s famous Natural’s custard apple ice cream. The election results were so close and interesting that I finished the whole pint of ice cream without even realizing it. I didn’t achieve the satiation point. My stomach was sick but mind wanted more. This is what is happening to most of us. We are not suicidal and we are not overeating by choice. The food is designed for over consumption. Somebody is profiting from it and got us captive. 
Dr. Robert Lustig of University of California, SanFrancisco has dedicated his life to research on this subject on obese children. He has found that when insulin levels are high (from overeating refined carbs), our body conserves energy and is less inclined to engage in physical activity. All these obese kids wanted to do was eat chips, cookies, ice cream and drink Cola and watch TV. They had no interest in playing outdoors. When their food was changed and insulin level reduced by medication, they started going out to play. We must understand that it is not our fault and it is definitely not a character flaw like gluttony and sloth in us as we are told. It is also the same ultra-processed foods (caloric dense nutrient poor) that make us deficient in nutrients. So as you can see the problem is not us the problem is the food. 

Myth: THE SOIL IS DEPLETED SO YOU NEED SUPPLEMENTS
The food supplements industry is $164 billion in the U.S. alone. There is some validity to the argument that due to damming of rivers and single crop farming, the soil has become depleted of many trace minerals. Plants produced today may not be as rich in nutrients as a century ago, but instead of taking supplements, increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can overcome these deficiencies.
As it is, our consumption of fresh produce has become a fraction of just two generations ago. So by simply increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables all deficiencies can be overcome. There is no need for supplements. The only exception is Vitamin B12 which our body made in the presence of a certain bacteria found in soil and ground water. As municipal supplies of water is chlorinated we do not get that bacteria. 
One must also understand that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about but how about the nutrients that are not-yet-known (NYKnowns). They are missing from the supplements and therefore supplements often cause imbalances. 
One classic example of this is a study that showed that cardiac patients who were given Beta Carotene supplements died earlier compared to the control group. This was because, (as we now know) there are 750 different carotenoids of which human body needs 50. By supplementing only Beta Carotene (known nutrient) body developed deficiency in other 49 carotenoids (NYKnowns at the time). 
In conclusion, eating a diverse variety of plant foods, avoiding processed refined foods, and supplements, and listening to your body's signals are key to achieving a proper nutrient balance.

[12/2/25, 7:26:20 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Myth: BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY•

What does “better safe than sorry” mean to you? 
Most people believe it is safer to continue taking certain medications rather than risk slightly elevated blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol levels. But WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.
In recent years, many senior doctors have realized that we've swung too far towards medicating lifestyle diseases. Studies from the past two decades suggest that excessive medication can often be more harmful than no medication at all. This phenomenon is known as the J-Curve. Progressive doctors have been vocal against overmedication for controlling blood pressure, sugar, and cholesterol. As a result, guidelines for medication thresholds have been revised. However, these changes haven't been widely disseminated, leading many doctors to follow outdated guidelines. 
Later in this blog, I'll present evidence supporting the revision of these guidelines towards more moderate medication thresholds. We'll also delve into the politics of the pharmaceutical, food, and healthcare industries, and examine the roles government and media play in our health.
Emerging evidence shows that previous approaches were flawed and potentially more harmful. Many doctors are now reevaluating their recommendations for treatment and testing. The increased specialization in medicine often leads to tunnel vision, neglecting the overall quality of life and mortality. Furthermore, our understanding of drug interactions is limited, and prescriptions from multiple specialists can lead to Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). I'll cover ADRs more in future blogs.

Human Body is Self Healing
"The human body is a remarkable self-healing mechanism, often smarter than we acknowledge. It adeptly copes with the diet and lifestyle it encounters. Elevated blood pressure, sugar, or cholesterol levels are often the body’s compensatory responses to various conditions.
However, the body struggles with synthetic medications. These substances are foreign and can disrupt the body's natural compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, they place a strain on the liver and kidneys, affecting them in ways not fully understood. 
To be safe, it's advisable to first address diet and lifestyle changes, allowing the body to naturally adjust these health markers. Of course, always seek medical advice and discuss your preferences with your doctor.

J -CURVE Concept
It's well-known that symptoms like high blood pressure or blood sugar are detrimental to health and, if uncontrolled, can lead to a shortened lifespan. Diseases typically follow a slanted S-curve, indicating that minor deviations from normal levels are less harmful and more manageable than more severe deviations. The impact on life expectancy isn't linear; a slight worsening of health markers is more concerning at advanced levels. For instance, a 10% increase in systolic blood pressure from 120 to 132 is concerning, but not alarmingly so. However, a 10% rise from 140 to 154 is significantly worrying. If it jumps 10% from 190 to 209, it becomes critical and demands immediate action.
We also know that all medications  have some negative side effects which may reduce our life expectancy. So clearly minimizing or eliminating medications should be a goal. Some BP patients are on a single pill which may not be as harmful, but some are on 6-7 different pills just for controlling BP. That situation is not at all desirable and if the person is also on diabetic or statin medications, it can harm in ways we do not fully understand. 


Given the considerations mentioned, many senior doctors are now questioning the wisdom of stringently controlling health markers with aggressive medication. Recent studies have been conducted to assess the impact of such medications and disease markers on overall life expectancy. These studies indicate that optimal results are often achieved with a moderate approach.

ACCORD Study
The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, initiated in September 1999 and sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is a significant example. This study aimed to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control, blood pressure management, and multiple lipid management on major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study, a landmark in its field, was supported by several collaborators:
- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
- National Institute on Aging (NIA)
- National Eye Institute (NEI)
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The researchers initially hoped that tighter control of blood sugar and blood pressure would enhance life expectancy. However, within eight years, it became evident that such stringent controls were, in fact, increasing all-cause mortality rates among patients. Consequently, the duration of the study was curtailed, as it would have been unethical to continue exposing patients to such risks. The chart below presents the raw data from the ACCORD study, which the American College of Physicians (ACP) used to revise their diabetes guidelines in 2018. It is noteworthy that even they took a decade to update their guidelines.


The link to their announcement of March 6, 2018 is given below. 
https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/acp-recommends-moderate-blood-sugar-control-targets-for-most-patients-with-type-2-diabetes

After the ACCORD study, many doctors called for a revision of the guidelines for blood pressure and blood sugar medications. In response, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-8) revised its blood pressure control guidelines in 2014 as shown below. 



The American College of Physicians updated their diabetes guidelines in March 2018. Both revisions faced objections from those whose income was most affected. In US, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) was pressured to disband the JNC, which had served for over four decades and transfer authority to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).
The American College of Physicians (ACP) 2018 diabetes guideline revision alarmed the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) so much so that they reinstated their own, more restrictive guidelines within seven days. I will discuss these issues in more detail in the coming months under the topic of the Politics of Diet & Health. For now, my aim is to inform you about the J-Curve and why it occurs. Many of you may not be aware of these recent revisions and could be overmedicating. I recommend discussing this with your healthcare providers as soon as possible.

Please pay attention to the above chart. It is the data behind the ACP guidelines. The research had shown as far back as 2009 that aggressive treatment of diabetes by conventional methods leads to higher all cause mortality.
The lowest all cause mortality is for A-1C in the range of 7.5 to 8.2.

[12/3/25, 7:12:24 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• PROTEIN MYTH •••

There are many myths related to protein in our society propagated, knowingly or unknowingly, by many in the food and healthcare industries. These myths include the belief that 
* The human body needs a lot of protein
* Protein is hard to find in food  
* Plant protein is somehow inferior to animal protein and doesn’t contain all amino acids. 

Even the United State's Food & Drug Administration (FDA), in its MyPlate guidelines, suggests the need for special foods to consume protein, as implied in their recommendations below.

The problem with this MyPlate recommendation is that fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy all contain protein, creating a misconception that special foods are necessary. The past head of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health criticized these guidelines as "utterly ridiculous." 

Here are some facts pointing to the opposite conclusion:
- The human body needs very little protein, as evidenced by the low protein content in mother's milk, which fuels newborns who are at the fastest growth stage of their life. 
-All proteins are made up of 20 amino acids in a chain configuration. Our body is able to make 11 but the remaining nine amino acids have to be consumed. For that reason they are called essential. It has been a long held myth that some of these nine are absent from some plant foods. For example it was believed that rice does not have lysine and beans do not have methionine. It is for this reason it was recommended that grains and beans should be combined in a balanced diet. 
We now know that plant proteins contain all essential amino acids, but their distribution varies among food groups. Eating from all five food groups ensures no deficiency. However it is still a good idea to combine beans & legumes with grains as in daal-chawal (legume-rice) or Idli or Khichri. 
- Protein is abundantly found in plant foods. For example, as a percentage of total calories, rice has 7%, watermelon 8%, guava 14%, romaine lettuce 19%, and spinach 30%. Potatoes have a similar protein content to mother's milk at 5-6%.

History of Protein
Protein was discovered in 1839 by German scientist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named for the Greek word Proteios, meaning "of prime importance." The US Government, in 1947, established the minimum protein requirement for humans at 5-6% of total calories, They were so concerned about protein deficiency (due to popular beliefs that physical labor and gym enthusiasts need more protein) that they wanted to include 98% of the population in their Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and therefore recommended a high figure of 8-10 percent of total calories requirement which amounted to 0.8 gram per kilogram of body weight. This amounts to 48 grams (240 calories) for a person weighing 60 kilograms or 10% (assuming 2,400 total calories a day). We did not know until 1899 that plant foods also have protein. For a long time plant protein was considered inferior to animal protein because it was believed to lack all essential amino acids which is incorrect. 

Human Proteome Project (2011-Now)
Most people know about a project called the “Human Genome Project” which was undertaken in 1990. Few are aware of “Human Proteome Project” that was undertaken a few years later to map all the proteins in human body. The science emerging from this ongoing project is called Proteomics. For reasons unknown to me, the findings of the Proteome project are not picked up by the mass media or social media much. I believe it may have something to do with its potential impact on the food industry especially meat, poultry and dairy. Here is what we now know about proteins in the human body: 
* Most humans need very little protein, only about 8% of their total calories. 
* An average adult body produces around 250 grams of new proteins daily and breaks down a similar amount due to wear and tear.
* The body efficiently recycles spent proteins into amino acids for new protein synthesis, but certain proteins like nails, hair, and dead skin cannot be recycled, resulting in a 15% shortfall from the daily requirement for individuals burning 2,400 calories, equivalent to 36 grams.
* The US Government's conservative recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight covers 98% of the population, potentially leading to overconsumption by 97% of the population, statistically speaking. 
* Excessive protein, especially from animal sources, can be harmful to the liver and kidneys, shortening their healthy lifespan.
* Periodic protein absence as during fasting, promotes autophagy (the recycling of dead and damaged cells). Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi received the 2016 Nobel Prize for his discoveries.
* Prolonged protein absence (9-10 days) can contribute to building immunity against major diseases like cancer as acknowledged by the 2018 Nobel Prize given to Dr. Tasuku Honjo. Practices like the Navratri fast among Hindus and Peryushan fast among Jains share this health objective. 
* Individuals who perform intense workouts or manual labor obtain extra protein through increased calorie consumption, eliminating the need for richer protein foods as the body efficiently recycles most excess spent protein generated during exercise.

Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Minimum
The food industry in its zeal to sell more animal food, distorted the minimum and recommended guidelines established by the US government and somehow the recommended amount was labeled as the minimum. Even leading universities, which are now mostly governed by Food and Drug Industries, are guilty of these distortions as you can see by performing a google search on “protein”. Until recently this search revealed that these distortions appear on prestigious web sites such as Healthline, WebMD and Harvard Health, which I quote below:
“The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.”

The above statement was a total lie. The site has now been revised and shows a lower recommendation of 0.8 gram per kilogram only. It may surprise you to note that there is not a single recorded case of protein deficiency in the civilized world.  Ninety seven percent of all Americans eat too much protein while at the same time 97% of all American diets are deficient in dietary fiber. Fiber is not found in any animal food or ultra-processed food. The nutrient of concern therefore should be fiber and not protein. Sadly press coverages on dangers of excessive protein consumption do not exist and the topic is conveniently ignored by mass media. This is in spite of doctors such as Dr. Colin Campbell (Cornel University), Dr Christopher Gardner (Stanford University) and Dr.Janice Stanger (UCLA) speaking about it at major conferences and in various documentaries and YouTube videos. 

Why is Animal Protein Harmful?
All animal protein comes with the IGF-1 hormone. This hormone helps animals grow rapidly. For example a 50 pound newborn calf becomes a 500 pound bull in 6 months. The IGF-1 hormone is very harmful in humans as it promotes growth of cancer cells which are already present in the body fluids of most people living in the civilized world. 
To make my point I like to give an example of a popular fertilizer in the United States called “Miracle Grow”. This fertilizer makes lawn grow very lush and green. However the lawn does not grow any taller. The thickness of the lawn depends upon the variety of the grass. It would only rise few inches above the soil. But if there are any weeds in the lawn, miracle grow makes them grow very tall very fast. This is because the weeds do not have auto truncating mechanism in their genes. Similarly human body has a built in truncating mechanism dictated by our genes. Our ring finger cannot become longer than the middle finger. When we consume IGF-1 hormone, it expedites the growth but our body cannot grow disproportionately. However any cancer cells, that are present in our body, do grow rapidly in the presence of IGF-1 hormone. This is why cancer growth gets promoted upon consumption of the IGF-1 hormone that accompanies animal protein. 
A study by Padambhushan Dr. Gopalan and Madhavan at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad in 1967 had demonstrated that, in the presence of carcinogens and sufficient food, animal protein can cause cancer cells to grow (we will discuss this more when we discuss the dairy myth). 
Studies also show associations between animal protein consumption and increased renal cancer cases, elevated LDL cholesterol and higher blood sugar levels.

Why is Excess Protein Harmful?
Of the three macronutrients that provide energy to sustain life, only protein has nitrogen. The others, carbohydrates and fat, are made up of only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Our body has subcutaneous fat cells that can store an almost unlimited amount of fat; it can also store up to 2,000 calories of sugar but it has no provision to store protein. 
When we eat more protein than needed, which most of us in the civilized world do, our body faces a problem: What do we do with that extra protein? The liver, which is the chemical factory in our body, removes the nitrogen from the protein and makes fat and ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is toxic, so the body combines it with water and converts it to uric acid.
The kidneys then filter it out as urine. This taxes two of our critical organs: the kidney and liver. This is a leading cause for kidney and liver failures at later stages in life in the civilized world. Additionally, when there is excess uric acid it crystallizes and the body tries to move it as far away as possible and deposits it into the big toe as uric acid crystals. This condition is called gout. Many French paintings from the Renaissance period show over weight royalties suffering from this disease. 
As a society our protein consumption (from meat, eggs and dairy) has increased multi fold in the past seven decades after World War 2. This has led to the growth of many lifestyle diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart diseases, Strokes, Dementia, Kidney and Liver diseases.

Anti-Aging Benefits of Protein Restriction
Recent research in the anti-aging field suggests that of all the major factors helping with anti-aging, restrictions on protein consumption is the most important. It helps in many ways including 
1. Improves immunity
2. Decreases Oxidative stress
3. Decreases Inflammation
4. Decreases Insulin Resistance
5. Decreases cancer promoting growth hormones
The latest book by Dr. Greger “How Not To Age” deals with this subject in detail and I highly recommend it. 

Benefits of Occasional Protein Deficiency
The two Nobel prizes on fasting in 2016 and 2018 have demonstrated that absences of protein during fasting is very beneficial for human health. It leads to autophagy, whereby the body recycles its dead and damaged cells to get amino acids and make new cells. The net effect is that the body’s average cell age reduces. It is for this reason I recommend that one should keep Ekadashi and Navratri fasts. We will cover this subject in detail when we discuss the second pillar of health: Detoxification. 

Personal Case History
The Protein myth has been so prevalent in our society that I am reminded of the 1950’s when my grandfather insisted that I drink a glass of milk every morning with an egg yolk (not to mention the sugar which was always added to milk in India in those days). While I hated drinking it, I had no choice in the matter. Little did my grandfather know that he was causing me harm. He had the best of intentions and, based on the prevalent wisdom at the time, he was doing the right thing. 

Protein for Muscles?
Another misconception about protein is that eating protein builds muscles. If it was so easy, every man would look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Muscles develop when we exercise them. The famous gladiators of the Roman period 2,000 years ago, who had to fight for life every day, were all vegans. Please watch the documentary “The Game Changers”. This is also discussed in the documentary “Forks over Knives”. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, the emphasis on protein consumption, especially from animal sources, has led to widespread misconceptions and health issues in our society. It is crucial to reevaluate dietary guidelines and focus on a balanced and plant-based approach for overall well-being.

A long-standing, prevalent belief champions dairy as the perfect food. While it may indeed be ideal for calves it is not the case for humans. The perfect food for humans is human milk, and that too only during infancy. Humans are unique in two respects: (1) they continue milk consumption beyond infancy and (2) they consume the milk of another species. The origins of this practice are murky but it may have begun thousands of years ago during a famine. In desperate times consumption of cow’s milk, which led to survival, may have sparked the widespread domestication of cows.

This topic presents a personal conflict for me. Numerous doctors in the Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement advise against dairy, supported by a plethora of studies. However Ayurveda, an ancient Indian wisdom, endorses it, albeit sparingly. Most PBWF recommendations align with Ayurveda except for dairy products like milk and ghee.

All mammals nurse their young with milk specifically formulated for their offspring's growth rate. For instance, a calf grows tenfold in six months, necessitating a milk composition rich in proteins, fats, and growth hormones like IGF-1. These components, while beneficial for calves, can potentially fuel cancer cell growth in humans without affecting normal cells, akin to how fertilizers promote lawn growth but also enable weeds to flourish unchecked.

INDIAN STUDY ON DAIRY PROTEIN
A groundbreaking study in 1967 by Dr. Gopalan and Madhvan at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad (India) examined the effects of dietary protein levels on cancer development. Mice, injected with a carcinogen and fed diets of varying protein levels, showed a direct correlation between high dairy protein intake and cancer growth. This study, which initially perplexed many, including Dr. Colin Campbell, laid the groundwork for a significant shift in understanding the relationship between animal protein and cancer.

Dr. Campbell's subsequent research, including the comprehensive China Study, underscored the detrimental effects of animal proteins, particularly from dairy, on our health. These findings advocate for minimizing dairy and animal protein consumption in diets exceeding 8% total protein, especially in affluent societies with abundant food choices.

It's important to recognize that dairy products do not cause cancer - they only contribute to its progression. The initiation of cancer is primarily due to gene mutations, which can result from a variety of factors such as radiation and toxic chemicals present in our environment. This suggests that cancer-causing agents were less prevalent in ancient times. 
In scenarios of food scarcity, dairy protein can be considered a viable nutritional option. Historically milk likely played a crucial role during times of famine, potentially saving many communities from extinction. It is also worth noting that gene mutations caused by toxic chemicals and radiation were presumably less common in the past due to the limited presence of these harmful agents.

In 1967, the per capita milk consumption in India was 107 ml per person- today it has quadrupled to 427 ml per person. This increase occurred despite widespread knowledge of milk's potential role in promoting health issues, including cancer. While the Government of India recognized Dr. Gopalan's contributions with the Padma Bhushan award, his advice on this matter was not heeded.

Why Milk Today is Harmful Compared to The Past
Today's dairy products differ significantly from those our ancestors consumed and we face different health challenges. Factors contributing to the harm caused by modern dairy include industrial farming practices, the genetic composition of dairy cows and the increased presence of environmental carcinogens. Additionally, lifestyle changes and increased life expectancy call for a reevaluation of dairy's role in our diet. Here are some examples:
* Dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination. 
* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.
* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield. 
* They are injected with high-dose antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions. 
All these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk cows produce and are very harmful to human health. 

Life expectancy in the olden days was low and an age of 70-80 was considered a life long lived. Very few lived beyond that. Today we are talking about increasing human life expectancy to 100+ years like in Blue Zones. 
I have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Michael Gregor. They all are against consuming dairy products. Dr. Collin Campbell did concede that if the total protein in a diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay to consume as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows.

Why Dairy Is Unhealthy?
Numerous studies and expert opinions highlight dairy's potential health risks including its ineffectiveness in bone health, its link to cancer, and its contribution to various diseases and conditions. Widespread lactose intolerance further underscores dairy's unsuitability for many. Here are some specific examples:
(1) There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries in Africa which have the lowest rate of milk consumption also have the lowest rate of osteoporosis. Conversely, countries consuming the most milk have the  highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers. 
(2) Dairy consumption increases the body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks. 
(3) According to a 2006 study by Harvard researchers, conducted with 10,000 women aged 26-46, the women who consumed the most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy product consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer. 
(4) Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body. 
(5) Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body. 
(6) Milk and cheese can cause acne. 
(7) Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases. 
(8) Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome. 
(9) Dairy is a cause of autoimmune diseases like arthritis.
(10) Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant. 
(11) Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes. 
(12) Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation. 
(13) Other problems associated with dairy include allergies and sinus issues. 
(14) Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet. 

Calcium Myth
Contrary to popular belief, the calcium in dairy is not efficiently absorbed due to its unfavorable phosphorus to calcium ratio. In order to absorb calcium one needs a calcium product that is conducive to absorption. The presence of phosphorus binds calcium to make calcium phosphate and biphosphate and diphosphate and makes it unavailable for absorption. To absorb calcium it must be available without phosphorus and milk does not provide that. So, for the most part, the calcium in the milk is in nonabsorbable. This is the reason why milk does not help people with osteoporosis. It even hurts them. 
Giving calcium pills as supplement also doesn’t help people with osteoporosis. Calcium just goes through the body and is excreted. Even vitamin D supplementation does not help. 
One has to do something to the bones to get calcium inside the bones. All the trials of supplementing calcium with vitamin D have failed. 
Dr. Lustig of UCSF recommends giving calcium to phosphorus in ratio of 4:1 whereas in milk it is 1:2. 
To achieve satisfactory calcium absorption other forms of calcium are required like calcium chloride or citrate. 
Here are some additional comments that support PBWF doctors' view against dairy. 
* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and even headaches after giving up dairy. 
* Dr. Neil Bernard filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order. 
* The US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in its dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health was one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and had called them “utterly ridiculous”.
* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia. 

Conclusion
Despite its historical role in human nutrition, the evidence against dairy consumption's health benefits is compelling. Alternatives to dairy, including plant-based milks and yogurts, offer nutritious and safe options for those seeking to avoid dairy's pitfalls. Acknowledging both the scientific findings and the cultural practices surrounding dairy consumption can guide us towards healthier dietary choices.

[12/5/25, 7:25:13 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Myth: A CALORIE IS A CALORIE

The belief that all calories are equal is a widespread myth, even among the well-educated segments of our society. This notion is heavily promoted by the processed food industry to justify the increasing presence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. The argument posits that the source of calories—whether from protein, fat, carbohydrates, or whether the food is whole or refined, cooked or raw—is irrelevant. What matters, according to this myth, is the balance between calories consumed and expended, with any excess supposedly stored as fat in our bodies. 
This perspective simplifies the issue to a matter of energy balance: consume more than you expend, and you'll gain weight. Consequently, the narrative absolves processed foods of blame, placing the onus on individual discipline to "eat less and exercise more." It reduces dietary advice to avoiding gluttony and laziness, suggesting that any calorie can fit into a balanced diet.
However, Dr. Robert Lustig from UCSF—one of the few remaining independent medical schools in the U.S.—has extensively researched this topic. He points out and I quote “This is the biggest lie in the history of medicine." The food industry's vested interest in perpetuating this myth has misled many into believing it's an incontrovertible truth. For instance, the sugar industry once advertised that three teaspoons of sugar were less fattening than an apple, diverting criticism from sugar to other foods.



The Fallacy of Portion Control
The "A Calorie is a Calorie" mantra suggests that a daily deficit of 500 calories should lead to losing one pound per week. However, many people find their weight loss stalls after initial success, leading to frustration. This phenomenon occurs because the human body, intelligent and adaptable, reduces its metabolic rate when it senses a food shortage—a survival mechanism honed over millennia. Our basal metabolic rate can drop, conserving energy during periods of scarcity, similar to how some animals hibernate.

Not All Consumed Food is Absorbed
The first thing to understand is that it is not the calories consumed that matter, it is the calories absorbed that matter. How many calories get absorbed in the body is a function of many factors. Firstly the speed at which the digested food travels through the small intestine and secondly the absorption rate while this food is traveling through the small intestine. Both of these are a function of fiber content of the food. Plant based whole food (PBWF) is full of fiber and as a result it has high motility and travels through the small intestine, where most of the absorption takes place, quite fast. PBWF also has nutrients embedded inside fibers that take time to be extracted. As a result the PBWF gets absorbed only partially and the balance reaches the colon where it feeds the microbes which in turn make essential nutrients for the body. A good example of this is resistant starch present in beans.  When beans are consumed, a significant portion of calories don’t get absorbed in small intestines (hence the title resistant) and move on to colon where our microbes feed on them.  This is also called the second meal effect. 
Another good example is that of almonds. There are 165 calories in an ounce of almonds but when we eat them, only 135 get absorbed. Where do the other 30 calories go? The fiber in the almonds
Is both soluble and insoluble. The insoluble fiber forms a mesh like a fishnet and soluble fiber forms a gel which is filling the wholes in the net. Together they create a barrier in the upper part of small intestine which restricts the absorption of starch and glucose into liver. The liver therefore does not get overloaded and new fat is not formed from the fructose which in the absence of fiber does get formed in a process  called de novo lipogenesis (DNL)
DNL is a complex and highly regulated process in which carbohydrates from circulation are converted into fatty acids that are then used for synthesizing either triglycerides or other lipid molecules. DNL helps keep the sugar and insulin levels down. High insulin level is very harmful as it drives abnormal growth. It drives vascular muscle growth that leads to coronary artery disease. It also causes prostate growth. The 30 calories that did not get absorbed go to the colon where our microbes feed on them. 
As you can see from two examples above, the calories eaten are not necessarily calories absorbed. This explains why a calorie is not a calorie. 

Food Processing and Its Impact
The way food is processed before consumption also affects its health impact. The same 100 calories from sugarcane can vary greatly in their effect on health depending on whether they're consumed as fruit, juice, jaggery, or white sugar.

PBWF vs. Refined Food
Refined foods are devoid of fiber as a result they (1) move slower through small intestines taking longer to reach colon and (2) they get absorbed readily as the intestines don’t have to work as hard to extract nutrients from the mesh of fibers. This dual effect makes most of the calories get absorbed in small intestines only, leaving nothing or little for the microbes waiting in the colon. The microbes in colon, when regularly deprived of fibers and starch, start to feed on mucosal layers creating a breach exposing intact protein in food to colon lining made of tight junction epithelial cells. A leak through this layer causes various auto immune diseases. 

Circadian Rhythm
The timing of calorie consumption  also matters due to our body's circadian rhythms, affecting how food is processed at different times of the day. Recent (2017) Nobel Prize-winning research has shed light on these mechanisms, highlighting the importance of synchronizing. Dr. Satchin Panda’s research at the Salk Institute in SanDiego has shown that carbohydrates consumed during daytime are handled differently than during night. During daytime they are kept as readily available glucose in the blood and during night they are quickly converted into triglycerides and stored away as fat. 

Macronutrient as a Sources of Calories
The source of calories—whether from proteins, fats, or carbohydrates—significantly influences health outcomes. Calories from proteins, for example, affect the body differently than those from fats or carbohydrates. Even within a single macronutrient category like carbohydrates, the impact varies based on the type, such as starch, glucose, or fructose.

Calories From Carbohydrates 
Carbohydrates, which include starches, glucose, and fructose, are metabolized differently in the liver. Starches are converted into glucose by the liver and distributed throughout the body. Table sugar, comprises equally of glucose and fructose and they are processed differently by the liver. Glucose circulates in the blood, while fructose can be converted into glucose for energy or into fat for storage, depending on need which is judged by insulin levels. High insulin levels signifies the sufficiency of glucose in the blood and prompts the liver to convert fructose into fat, which can be stored in subcutaneous fat cells or, if the process is overwhelmed, lead to ectopic fat deposits. This can contribute to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), visceral fat accumulation, and insulin resistance, the main cause of type 2 diabetes.
So once again you can see that a calorie is not a calorie. Glucose calorie is kept as readily usable glucose but fructose calorie may be stored as fat. 

Calories from  Protein 
Human body is very efficient in recycling protein as a result the protein requirement by the body is rather minimal. So liver converts all extra protein into fat or carbohydrates by a process called deamination. Deamination is the opposite of amination and it is a type of post-translational modification (PTM) in which an amine group is removed from a protein. This process creates organic acids which provide energy (ATP) to cells. 
This process costs energy, in fact twice as much energy as what it takes to burn carbohydrates. So the net result is that protein provides less calories than carbohydrates, by some estimates as much as 30% less. This explains the popularity of keto diets but this extra burden on liver and kidneys leads to problems in those organs as we age. 

Calories from Fat
All fats are 9 calories per gram but it is wrong to think that all fats are equal. Omega-3 fats are very healthy fats but trans-fats are very unhealthy. Trans-fats cannot be broken down by our body cells into energy (ATP).
When we run out of glucose stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, the body can use fat to provide energy. Theoretically it is correct however in practice the body first sends hunger pangs as a signal to consume more sugar or starch (which provide glucose more readily) before digging into it’s reservoir of fat which is kept for rainy day when food may not be available. So this is another reason a calorie is not a calorie. 

Myth: Exercising Alone Will Take Care of My Health
One common myth many young people, who exercise regularly, have is that “Nothing wrong can happen to them because they physically work out regularly”. As a result they become lax in dietary discipline. The data shows that about half of the people, who die after their first heart attack, have no signs of cardiovascular disease. Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF points this out clearly in his book Metabolical suggesting that of the 8 mechanisms for a healthy body, exercise helps only 4. Food is most important for good health and must not be neglected. 

Conclusion
As you can see from explanations given above, it is not only what food you eat that matters, it is also what is done to the food and what your body’s metabolic response is to the food that matters. This underscores the principle that not all calories are equivalent, highlighting the importance of considering the source and type of macronutrients in dietary choices.

[12/5/25, 7:25:14 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •SUPPLEMENTS MYTH•

Growing up, our eating patterns are largely influenced by family habits, leading to a limited diet that may cause nutrient deficiencies. Unlike handling excess nutrients, our bodies struggle with deficiencies. Relying on inorganic or organic supplements to address these deficiencies can disrupt our body’s balance.

Food Supplements Industry
In the United States alone the food supplements industry boasts a revenue exceeding $160 billion and is expected to reach $265 billion by 2030. This industry thrives on confusion and doubt, funding studies to make you question your nutrient intake and promote supplement use.

Depletion of Soil
It is an acknowledged fact that today’s plant foods are not as nutrient-rich due to factors like river damming for hydropower, monoculture farming and inorganic fertilizers. These practices deplete essential trace minerals in the soil. When we use inorganic fertilizers, the focus is only on a few key nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium etcetera. This depletes the trace minerals in the soil and the food it produces. When we use compost made of human and animal waste these trace minerals are recycled back into soil. 
The arguments presented by the food supplements industry to point out nutrition depletion in modern plant produce are valid arguments. What is not valid is why should one take supplements instead of eating another carrot or apple to make up for mineral depletion. People are eating fewer fruits and vegetables compared to our grandparents generation. They actually should be eating more to make up for deficiency in nutrients. Eating refined and ultra processed foods further reduce the nutrients in our diet. Our diets are becoming calorie rich and nutrient poor. This is one of the reasons why organic food is richer in trace minerals (besides of course the absence of pesticides). This is also the reason why food grown in the wild, like wild berries, is much healthier. 

What About Not-Yet-Known (NYKnown) Nutrients?
A major problem with supplements is that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about. But there are likely to be many more nutrients in food which have not yet been discovered. So when we take supplements, it creates imbalances in the not-yet-known nutrients. 

Beta Carotene Study
To make my point I like to give the example of Beta Carotene, which is from a family of carotenoids. Beta Carotene was discovered almost two centuries ago and has since been believed to be an important nutrient, just like vitamin C, for heart health. Many cardiologists have been prescribing Beta Carotene supplementation for heart health. However a major study recently revealed that the groups of patients who received Beta Carotene supplementation were dying early compared to the groups that did not. This was quite perplexing and further analysis showed that there are actually 750 types of carotenoids and the human body needs about fifty of them. Our body cells have limited receptors to receive these carotenoids. When we supplement only one carotenoid like Beta Carotene, the receptors get flooded with this carotenoid, not leaving enough room to receive other 49 carotenoids. This created deficiency in these other carotenoids among those groups who received supplementation and led to earlier deaths. 

Symphony of Nutrients
Nutrients behave in complex ways with other nutrients. Reducing them to a single nutrient at a time and consuming does not replicate those processes. As elaborated by Dr Colin Campbell in the documentary “Forks over Knives”, all nutrients work in a synergism, like various instruments in a symphony. Often you don’t even hear the individual instruments, but the symphony is very pleasing and sounds beautiful. To isolate one instrument and enhance it can spoil the symphony. Each of our bodies is like a symphony played out with various nutrients. We know now, after the discovery of Epigenetics, that each one of us has a very different microbiome composition. So it is like each one of us has a body playing out our individual symphony. 
There are many other examples of nutrient imbalances. Here are few more: 
1. Taking Calcium supplements depletes Magnesium because Magnesium is required by the body to absorb Calcium.
2. Taking Zinc supplements reduces Copper absorbability and taking Copper supplement creates imbalance in Zinc. 
3. Presence of Phosphorus reduces calcium absorbability as in dairy milk.  

Impact on Liver & Kidney
After food is absorbed in the small intestines all supplements consumed first go to liver, which is the chemical factory in our body. The supplements get metabolized there and filtered through the kidneys. This increases the load on these vital organs, reducing their healthy lifespan. This impact is only noticeable once we reach an old age. 
How trace minerals and many micro nutrients affect our body is a science that is not fully understood yet, and lot more research has to be done. So the safest approach is to avoid all supplements. Vitamin B12 is the only exception because the municipal water supply that we consume is all chlorinated and kills the bacteria that produces vitamin B12. 

False Sense of Security 
Taking supplements can also create a false sense of security and makes us pay less attention to our diet. All nutrient deficiencies should be compensated by consuming balanced meals. We must add foods to our diet that we have been missing. My recommendation is to eat multiple varieties in each food group and specially green leafy vegetables, berries, flaxseeds and walnuts.

Reductionist Approach
As the science of nutrition evolved a century ago our focus was on understanding the roles of various nutrients in our body’s functioning. 
The human mind has limitations and it works better in understanding linear correlations. As a result we tended towards a reductionist approach to nutrition. The role of Vitamin C became clear based on research on sailors who were deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for extended periods and developed scurvy. The food industry was quick to provide solutions by isolating vitamins to make up for the deficiencies. Creating and propagating this reductionist and deficiency mindset serves the purpose of the Processed Food and Supplements industry well. Nutrition science has focused on these two approaches for the past century and, in spite of the wealth of academic knowledge on nutrition and chronic diseases, one does not see any dent in the growth of such diseases. It begs the question "Why is that so?" One explanation is that the field of nutrition has become more about marketing profitable products than educating people about the fundamentals of health and wellness. 

There is a tendency on many people’s part, who are health conscientious, to look for ways to supplement their diet with healthy supplements. How does one define healthy supplements? Some think plant-based supplements are healthy and others think Ayurvedic or homeopathic supplements are healthy. 

Typical Indian Meal Plan

A cursory analysis of a typical Indian diet plan shows that we Indians consume over half of our calories from refined and processed foods which are empty calories. Replacing these empty calories with nutrient rich calories from plant based whole foods can easily take care of any nutritional deficiencies and should be the way to go. 

American Gut Project
A recent study known as the American Gut project (2013-2018) which involved participants from 45 countries showed some interesting results. It concluded that people who consumed a wide variety of plant based foods (over 30 varieties each week) were much healthier than those who consumed few (less than 10 varieties each week). Their immunity from infections diseases was also the highest in the first group. It is for this reason, I recommend that we should try to consume at least seven varieties in each of the five food group each week. The five food groups being Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Beans & Legumes and Nuts & Seeds. Besides this, one should also eat as many spices as one can each week. 

Conclusion
Nutrition is about the synergy of a diverse diet, not just supplementing with isolated nutrients. Embrace variety, focus on whole foods, and question the necessity of supplements for a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

Dr. Colin Campbell, who is considered the top nutritionist in the world today, emphasizes that one must unlearn everything one has come to know about nutrients and only remember that:
“FOOD, NOT NUTRIENTS, IS THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT IN NUTRITION.”

[12/5/25, 7:25:14 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: BASICS OF PHYSIOLOGY

After exploring various myths about diet and lifestyle, we will now delve into the fundamentals of human physiology and nutrition. Every living organism, from single cells to primates, has two primary objectives: (1) survival and (2) propagation. For survival, two elements are crucial, which in Vedanta are termed PRANA and APANA. Prana represents the life-giving force, including food and air (oxygen) for energy, while Apana refers to the elimination of waste produced by metabolism, driven by Prana. In this and the next three blog posts, we will examine the four basic systems of human physiology:

1. Gastrointestinal Tract: It ingests and processes food.
2. Respiratory System: It inhales fresh air and exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide.
3. Blood Circulatory System: It distributes nutrients and oxygen to every cell in the body.
4. Lymphatic System: It acts like a janitorial system, removing waste from all body parts due to metabolic processes. 

GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
This tract is the path from our mouth to the anus, through which food passes, is consumed, digested, absorbed, and eventually, waste is excreted.

As depicted in the pictures below, food enters our mouth where it is mixed with saliva and chewed into a fine slurry before moving through the esophagus to the stomach via a sphincter valve. In the stomach, food mixes with acids and digests over a period that can range from two to six hours. The total transit time of food, from ingestion to defecation, can vary from 10 to 72 hours, primarily depending on the type of food and gut health. Here's a breakdown:

- Gastric emptying: 2-6 hrs.
- Small Intestine transit: 2-6 hrs.
- Colonic transit: 6-60 hrs.
- Total Gut transit: 10 to 72 hrs.

This transit time largely depends on how nutrients are embedded within the food's fibers. Food lacking fiber moves slowly but is quickly absorbed. In contrast, plant-based whole foods move quickly due to the motility created by undigested fibers but are absorbed slowly, as extracting nutrients like sugars and starches from fibers takes time. This dynamic results in a significant challenge for animal and processed foods, as they are quickly and completely absorbed, leading to liver overload and potential weight gain, with little left for the colon's microbial inhabitants.

When this pattern repeats, our microbial guests become starved and agitated, starting to consume the mucosal layer they inhabit, eventually leading to inflammation and conditions like "Leaky Gut Syndrome" or "Irritable Bowel Disorder."

EPITHELIAL CELL LINING
The human gastrointestinal tract is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells with tight junctions, protected by an inner mucus layer containing goblet cells that produce mucus. Adjacent to this inner layer is an outer mucus layer, home to various microbes. 
The importance and roles of these colon microbes are becoming increasingly clear, giving rise to a new field called epigenetics. Surprisingly, our bodies host more foreign cells (38 trillion microbes) than our own cells (37 trillion). These microbes play a significant role in our health, overshadowing our genetic makeup. This was highlighted in the January 14, 2010, issue of TIME magazine.

"Microbiota" refers to the collective microbes (sometimes called a microbial garden), with "Microbiome" denoting their genetic makeup. These terms are often used interchangeably. An analogy to understand the human microbiome versus genome is comparing computer hardware and software: despite similar hardware, the software dictates the functionality, akin to how our epigenome, the body's software, influences gene expression. 
To make my point clear I like to give an example of cell phones. 
All cell phones in use today are very similar in terms of hardware however, how this hardware expresses itself visually on the screen or audibly on the speaker depends upon what software is being used. For example Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram all express very differently on the same phone. So our epigenome is our body’s software and it determines how our genes are expressing at any given moment. 

This understanding is revolutionizing medical science, leading to groundbreaking practices like fecal transplantation which was not even in the realm of our wildest imagination. An overweight woman, who has tried everything in her life to lose weight, loses weight simply upon receipt of a fecal transplantation from a slim woman. Some of the lessons we have learned with this new science suggest:
1. Same cause can manifest as different symptoms in different people. 
2. Same symptoms can be due to different causes in different people therefore diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science distraught with many hits and misses. 
4. A different diet for different diseases doesn’t make sense but a different diet for different individuals could make sense. It is conceivable that soon in future, we may create meal plans based on one’s fecal sample analysis. 

Refined vs. Whole Food
Consider the example of identical twins T1 and T2, consuming the same ingredients (wheat, peanuts, and apples) in different forms for breakfast. T1 opts for porridge in peanut milk with fresh apples, while T2 consumes refined flour kachori fried in peanut oil with apple juice. T1 maintains health, but T2 may gain weight and risk developing diabetes, liver, and kidney issues. This disparity arises because T1's body might leave some calories for the microbiome, keeping them happy and satisfied, whereas T2's body absorbs all calories in the small intestine, leaving nothing for microbial digestion. This causes microbes to consume the mucosal layer in which they reside. Over time, this can lead to leaky gut and autoimmune diseases. 
Sugar spikes due to Apple juice and refined flour would result in new fat formation in liver (de novo lipogenesis) causing non alcoholic fatty liver disease and visceral fat and insulin resistance (Diabetes type-2). Ultimately both the kidney and liver will be affected shortening his lifespan. 

The impact of diet on health is profound, yet often overlooked, with many attributing health issues to bad luck. However, chronic diseases are less about luck and more about the consequences of dietary choices, particularly the consumption of refined and highly processed foods.

Conclusion
The transition from whole foods to refined and processed options during the past century is a primary contributor to lifestyle-related diseases. These diseases affect our body on a daily basis in small ways that are rarely noticeable until it is often too late. They are not impervious as we often like to believe. Taking medications to suppress symptoms is not the solution. The diet has to be modified.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

Yesterday we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract, which provides the essential nutrients our bodies need to sustain themselves. These nutrients require oxygen to metabolize and produce energy. The respiratory system is crucial in delivering fresh oxygen to the body and expelling carbon dioxide. While the respiratory system is also involved in sound production and the sense of smell, our focus here will be on the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

When we inhale through our nose or mouth, the air travels down the trachea into the lungs, where it divides into multiple branches called bronchioles, eventually reaching tiny sacs known as alveoli. The human lung contains over 600 million alveoli, with their combined surface area roughly equivalent to a tennis court.

Surrounding the alveoli are blood capillaries that carry blood from various body parts. This blood is rich in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs across the alveolar membrane and the capillary walls through diffusion. The picture below shows how an alveolar capillary exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen. 


Diminished Surface Area
At birth, the surfaces of the alveoli and capillaries are pristine, maximizing gas exchange efficiency. However, over time, two significant changes occur. First, dust and pollutant particles accumulate on the alveolar lining, reducing the area available for gas exchange. Second, the capillaries' inner linings develop plaque due to the consumption of inflammatory foods, further diminishing the available surface area. As we age, the reduction in surface area becomes more pronounced, leading to breathing difficulties, a condition known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
It is important to understand that obstruction is happening on both sides of that one tennis court size surface of all 600 million plus alveoli of the lung. 
The obstruction on the capillary wall is due to atherosclerosis which is classified as a cardiovascular disease. 
The discomfort one experiences in breathing is due to the combination of these two phenomenons working together. 
Historically, main pollutants like dust and coal particles from wood and charcoal burning prompted people to seek cleaner air in sanatoriums as they aged.

Diminished Breathing Capacity
Breathing capacity is another crucial factor. The average lung holds about 6 liters of air, but only a fraction is used during normal breathing. This capacity, which varies among individuals and even within the same person over time, increases with physical activity. Enhancing respiratory capacity through active lifestyles can improve conditions like COPD, as physical activity can help revive some collapsed alveoli.

Symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, wheezing, and a chronic cough. The cough is a mechanism by which body clears obstructions, but when these consist of fine particles, the condition becomes persistent. That is why it is called chronic. 

Nitric Oxide Gas to Rescue
Consuming green leafy vegetables and beetroots, which are high in nitrates, release nitric oxide in the blood vessels, aiding in the removal of atherosclerotic damage and improving gas exchange. These vegetables can be consumed as salad or green juice. Additionally, Pranayama breathing exercises like Bhastrika and Kapalbhati can help alleviate respiratory obstructions, offering benefits for those with respiratory conditions.

BLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 

In our past two sessions, we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract and the Respiratory System, which provide the nutrients and oxygen necessary for survival. 
Once absorbed, these nutrients need to be transported to every part of the human body, a task accomplished by the blood circulatory system. 
This system is comprised of a heart that acts as a pump and approximately 70,000 miles of blood vessels, evenly split between arteries (which carry blood from the heart to all body parts) and veins (which return the blood to the heart). At the site where the blood is delivered, these vessels narrow into thin capillaries.

The blood vessels' internal lining consists of a single layer of endothelial cells. This network is so extensive that the total surface area of this lining equals about 6-8 tennis courts. Collectively, this surface is known as the endothelium, arguably the largest organ in the human body. When the heart pumps blood, it causes the blood vessels to expand slightly due to pressure, which then drops, causing the vessels to shrink. These fluctuations are known as systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

Nitric Oxide Gas
A unique feature of the endothelial lining is its ability to release nitric oxide (NO) gas, facilitating smooth blood flow. When blood vessels develop plaque, the effective opening narrows, increasing the friction and, consequently, the blood pressure needed to maintain blood flow.

Evolution Time Line
Our bodies have evolved over billions of years. In a hypothetical 500-page book about human evolution, the domestication of animals and the advent of agriculture would appear only in the last paragraph of the final page. I mention this to address common arguments advocating animal-based foods, despite the facts.

What is Inflammation?

Inflammation is the body's reaction to perceived threats, which may not always be genuine. For instance, consider everyday activities that pose no danger because they are familiar. When we rise early in the morning, there are numerous routines we follow that do not alarm us because they are habitual, and we recognize the individuals involved. For instance, a sweeper cleans the street, a newspaper delivery person brings the newspaper, and the regular housekeeper rings the doorbell, to which we respond by letting her in.
Imagine a scenario where the doorbell rings again, and through the peephole, you see a tall, unfamiliar figure. This might trigger a sense of alarm or perceived threat. You might whisper to your spouse to stay silent, pretending no one is home, in hopes the stranger will leave. Alternatively, if your spouse is a retired military officer, he might retrieve a firearm from a safe and loudly inquire who's at the door. There could be various responses to this situation. The individual outside may pose no actual threat and could be a new neighbor seeking directions to the university. Nonetheless, the critical point here is the perception of threat and the consequent reaction, which is analogous to inflammation. In this metaphor, the situation is inflammatory, prompting an 'inflamed' response, which represents inflammation.

Inflammatory Foods 
Consuming plant-based whole foods, which have been part of our diet for millions of years, does not alarm the body. However, introducing animal products, refined, or ultra-processed foods, which are relatively new to our diet, triggers an inflammatory response. Such foods can compromise the integrity of the endothelial lining, leading to the formation of plaques as a repair mechanism.

ATHEROSCLEROSIS 
This process is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis starts early, as soon as children transition from breast milk to solid foods. Continuous consumption of inflammatory foods promotes plaque buildup, narrowing blood vessels and leading to increased blood pressure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and likely worldwide.

Green Leafy Vegetables To The Rescue
Green leafy vegetables are very rich in nitrates. When we consume them as salads or green juice, they release nitric oxide in the blood, helping unclog the blood vessels. This effect has been demonstrated by Dr. Caldwell Esselystyn of the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Dean Ornish of UCSF, showing potential in reversing cardiovascular diseases and reducing dependency on medications.

One must understand that lifestyle diseases are not random phenomena and they do not develop all of a sudden. They exist on a continuum and the markers like BP are body’s way of compensating for them. Lowering the markers with medication whether Allopathic, Homeopathic, Unani or Ayurvedic is not the solution. One must address the cause which is almost always our diet and lifestyle.

[12/7/25, 6:50:22 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: (4) LYMPHATIC SYSTEM
So far we have discussed how nutrients, essential for life, are consumed and distributed throughout the body. With the help of these nutrients every cell performs its metabolic function and in the process creates waste. The gaseous waste carbon dioxide is removed by the respiratory system but other waste is excreted as sweat, urine and feces. The system that collects this waste and takes it to the organs that excrete it (kidney, colon and skin) is called the Lymphatic System. It consists of a large network of lymphatic vessels throughout the body which merge into lymph nodes, lymphoid organs, lymphoid tissues and lymph.

The lymphatic system is also part of the immune system. It keeps body fluid levels in balance and defends the body against infections. The way the lymphatic system functions is by removing fluids (other than blood) from body tissues and cleaning it and recycling it. 
Many of the lymph nodes reside in our underarms and where our legs join the body. Interestingly the lymphatic system does not have a pump and relies heavily on the body’s movement specially the hands and the legs. 
This is one reason why the regular movement of hands and legs is very important. The important function of walking is often neglected by most writers while criticizing the 10,000 steps recommendation. Ideally these steps should be spread throughout the day as much as possible. 

With this discussion, we've covered four critical systems of human physiology. Next week, we'll delve into the basics of nutrition.

[12/7/25, 6:50:22 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •BASICS OF NUTRITION•

Having discussed the basics of physiology, describing how nutrients are ingested and distributed throughout the body and waste is collected and excreted, we will now delve into the types of nutrients and their role in bodily functions. Nutrients are categorized into three groups:
1. Macronutrients: Provide energy.
2. Micronutrients: Provide essential nutrients without energy.
3. Other Nutrients

1.0 MACRO NUTRIENTS 
Macronutrients are energy-providing nutrients, measured in kilocalories but often referred to as calories. The three macronutrients are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.

1.1 Proteins
We previously discussed proteins in the context of nutrition myths. To recap, proteins, providing 4 calories per gram, are vital for every cell. They consist of chains of twenty different amino acids in various permutations and combinations. Out of these, nine are essential, meaning our body cannot synthesize them, so they must be ingested through food. A typical human body utilizes approximately 200 grams of protein daily, recycling about 85% of it, leaving a deficit of about 30 grams. The body lacks a storage system for proteins; excess intake is converted into fat and nitrogen in the liver. The fat is stored subcutaneously, while nitrogen is transformed into ammonia, then uric acid, and finally excreted as urine. Excessive protein intake can strain the liver and kidneys, shortening their productive life. This is the reason why dialysis is becoming so common among the baby boomer generation. 

1.2 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, providing four calories per gram. They include starch, glucose, fructose, lactose, and glycerols. Starch is converted into glucose in the liver, which is then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream. The liver can convert fructose into glucose or fat, depending upon the need of the body. This key difference plays an important role in 
influencing metabolism significantly. 

1.3 Fats
Fats, offering nine calories per gram, are a dense energy source and the preferred storage form for excess calories. Fats are categorized by saturation level or chain length:
• Saturated Fats: Each carbon atom is bonded to hydrogen, predominantly found in animal products and considered unhealthy in excess.
• Monounsaturated Fats: Contain one double bond and are found in plant foods like nuts, seeds and avocados, beneficial for health.
• Polyunsaturated Fats: Contain multiple double bonds. These include essential omega-3 and omega-6 fats. Of the two, Omega-6 is found in plenty in nature but Omega-3 is scarcer so special attention needs to be paid. Our body needs both omega-3 and omega-6 in equal amounts. 
Many vegetable oils are too rich in omega-6 and have hardly any omega-3.  Any ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 higher than 3 is problematic and should be avoided. The richest plant based sources of Omega-3 are Flaxseeds, Chia seeds, Hempseeds, Mustard seeds and walnuts. Mustard which is found in abundance has an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 3:1 which is very healthy. That is why mustard seeds should be consumed regularly and mustard oil is the least harmful of all oils. 
• Trans Fats: When oils undergo hydrogenation, they transform into a solid form at room temperature. These hydrogenated oils are known as trans fats and are highly detrimental to health. They gained popularity at the turn of the 19th century when saturated animal fats were discouraged due to heart health concerns. Trans fats are commonly found in products like vegetable shortening and margarine. Owing to their adverse health effects many countries, including the U.S., have banned them. However, they are still permitted in India. Dalda, introduced in India about a century ago, is a prominent example of trans fats; in the U.S., Crisco is a well-known equivalent.

Fats can also be classified by the length of the fatty acid chains, which can be short, medium, long, or extra-long. When we consume whole plant-based foods fiber is digested by bacteria in the lining of our colon, producing short and medium-chain fatty acids that are beneficial to our health.

(2) MICRONUTRIENTS 
Micronutrients are crucial for health but they do not provide any energy. They include following:

2.1 Vitamins
Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the body requires in small amounts for nutrition. There is a variety of vitamins readily available in plant-based foods. However, two vitamins that warrant particular attention are B12 and D3. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria found in soil, which can enter our bodies through groundwater or direct contact with the soil, such as when farming barehanded and barefoot. In modern times, we often avoid direct contact with soil, and our water, sourced from municipal tanks, is chlorinated, killing all bacteria. Consequently, B12 deficiency is quite common among vegans. Although B12 is present in green water plants, commonly known as seaweeds, which make a regular part of diets in Japan, Korea and China, they are not consumed in India and the rest of the world. These seaweeds can also be good sources of vitamin D3 and Iodine. 

2.2 Minerals 
Minerals are found in air, water, and soil and plants absorb them effectively. These minerals enter our bodies through plant-based foods. However, the use of inorganic fertilizers and practices like monoculture farming can deplete the soil of these vital nutrients and seeds leading to deficiencies in our diet. To counteract this, it is crucial to consume organically grown produce and utilize rock salts, which are abundant in trace minerals. Among these, iodine deserves special attention. It is advisable to incorporate iodine-enriched salts into your diet to ensure adequate intake.

2.3 Antioxidants
When various metabolic reactions occur in our body, they often release a single atom of oxygen. These oxygen atoms are highly reactive and can cause oxidation of other molecules nearby, leading to a phenomenon known as oxidative stress. Certain chemical compounds, known as antioxidants, are effective in neutralizing these single oxygen atoms. Many plant foods are abundant in antioxidants and consuming them can help reduce oxidative stress. While all fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, berries, leafy greens, herbs, and spices are particularly rich sources and should be included in one's daily diet.

2.4 Phytonutrients
Phytonutrients are phytochemical compounds produced by plants to protect themselves against attacks from fungi, bacteria and plant viruses, as well as from insects and other small animals. In large concentrations, some of these compounds can also be poisonous. Approximately 10,000 different phytochemicals have been identified, but discussing them all is beyond the scope of this blog. However, I would like to highlight two of them: carotenoids and polyphenols. The most well-known carotenoid is beta-carotene, discovered nearly two centuries ago and linked to eye and heart health. It is found in carrots, hence the name carotene. Today, we understand that there are 750 different carotenoids, and the human body requires about 50 of them. Supplementing with beta-carotene was a common practice until recently, but it can lead to imbalances in the absorption of other carotenoids and should therefore be avoided.

Polyphenols are phytonutrients that help protect body tissues against oxidative stress and associated pathologies, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, and inflammation.

(3) WATER
Water is an essential nutrient and must be consumed regularly. The human body does produce some water when it burns fat, but not enough to sustain itself. It is challenging to survive beyond a week or two without water. I recommend consuming two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, even before brushing your teeth. This practice is beneficial because our body produces saliva overnight, which is good for our health. We should swallow this saliva with water. Additionally, one should drink a glass of water an hour after every meal and another glass before going to bed. Except for the water consumed in the morning and at night, which should be drunk as is, it is a good habit to obtain most of your water intake from eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are primarily water anyway. Hence the saying "eat your water."

(4) FIBER
Fiber is an essential nutrient that is often misunderstood and neglected. Here are some key benefits of fiber:
- Fiber aids in the motility of our intestines.
- It slows down nutrient absorption in our small intestines, allowing certain foods, such as resistant starch, to reach the colon where they serve as nourishment for bacteria.
- Fiber moderates the absorption of sugar in our liver, preventing its overload. An overloaded liver can lead to several issues, including (1) fatty liver, potentially progressing to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, (2) the accumulation of visceral fat, and (3) the formation of intramyocellular lipid, which can cause insulin resistance, leading to Type 2 diabetes.
- Fiber supports the beneficial bacteria in our gut, helping them produce short- and medium-chain fatty acids, which are vital for our health.

Conclusion 
All nutrients play a crucial role in our health, functioning in a complementary manner akin to a symphony performed by an orchestra. We should obtain these nutrients from plant-based foods, which are their primary sources. It is advisable to avoid secondary sources and supplements.

‎[12/7/25, 6:50:23 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ‎<attached: 00000428-PHOTO-2025-12-07-18-50-23.jpg>
[12/8/25, 7:44:45 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: FIVE PILLARS OF HEALTH

We have so far delved into numerous diet and lifestyle myths that often lead us astray. We've also touched on the essentials of human physiology and nutrition. Today, we embark on a series about what I term the "five pillars of health," key components that bolster our well-being and aid in preventing and reversing many lifestyle-related diseases.
The advent of the light bulb and the discovery of antibiotics a century ago marked a societal shift, leading us to normalize disease as an inevitable aspect of aging. The light bulb disrupted our circadian rhythms, spawning numerous chronic health issues, while the triumph of penicillin over infectious diseases fostered a belief that a pill could be the panacea for all ailments. 
Post-World War II affluence ushered in an era of lifestyle diseases like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. When pills fell short, the medical and pharmaceutical sectors proposed a new narrative: chronic diseases were incurable, pinned on overindulgence and inactivity. Their solution was to manage these conditions by keeping their markers in check with ongoing medication and check-ups. 
Meanwhile, the rise of the processed food industry post-WWII, driven by shareholder profits, led to less nutritious, irresistible food options, contributing to a surge in health issues. This convergence of interests among the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, overlooked by government and media, has escalated chronic diseases to unprecedented levels, quietly normalizing this unhealthy status quo to a point where we have more sick people than healthy people in the civilized world. 

Acknowledging that diet and lifestyle are at the core of many chronic conditions begs the question: Why not change them? 
The human body has an innate ability to heal, but relying on medications to mask symptoms interrupts this process, often leading to a cascade of further health complications. The spiral of illness thus created continues untill death. 
Studies of centenarians in "Blue Zones" debunk the myth that chronic diseases are a given in old age. These populations live well into their 90s and beyond, largely disease-free. 
There is overpowering evidence that suggests that there are five pillars of health which contribute to prevention and reversal of most chronic diseases if not all.

(1) Food
Our 37 trillion cells require nourishment, which is compromised by modern food processing techniques. Removing fiber and adding harmful ingredients which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) disrupt our satiety signals and contribute to chronic illnesses. 
Notably, research indicates that a diet with more than 8% protein, particularly from animal sources, can promote cancer. Key dietary rules include avoiding animal products, refined foods, and ultra-processed items.

(2) Detoxification 
The food consumed is metabolized by cells throughout the body, producing waste that needs to be collected and excreted. The lymphatic system, nearly as extensive as the circulatory system, facilitates this process. The human brain can only eliminate metabolic waste during the deep sleep cycle at night. In addition to metabolic waste, our bodies also accumulate dead and damaged cells that can harm adjacent healthy cells. The Nobel Prize-winning research from 2016 demonstrated that fasting for over 22 hours induces a process called autophagy, where the body recycles such waste. Thus, it is highly recommended to fast every two weeks, aligning with the Indian tradition of Ekadashi fasts. Furthermore, another Nobel Prize-winning study in 2018 showed that prolonged fasting for 10 days, with only a small, especially low-protein meal each day, enhances immunity against serious diseases like cancer. This practice is strikingly similar to the Indian Navratri fasting tradition. Other yoga practices, such as Shatkarma, are also beneficial for detoxifying the body.

(3) Circadian Rhythm
All species of plants and animals on Earth have evolved within a 24-hour day-night cycle and are well adapted to this rhythm. Many glands in our body release hormones in sync with these cycles, regulating various bodily functions. However, with the advent of electricity, our lifestyles have shifted away from the natural day-night rhythm, disrupting our body's synchronization with nature's clock. Notably, the 2017 Nobel Prize was awarded for research demonstrating how our body's master clock aligns with the day-night cycle. Dr. Satchin Panda's work at UC San Diego and the Salk Institute over the past decade has shed light on this topic. For optimal health, consider the following recommendations:
Sun Gazing: Rise before sunrise and, within half an hour of sunrise and sunset, gaze around the sun, moving your eyes in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. Avoid direct sun gazing. 
Eating Patterns: Refrain from eating for at least an hour after sunrise and aim to finish dinner before sunset, or at least before it gets dark outside. 
Physical Activity: Avoid strenuous workouts when it's dark outside. 
Screen Time: Minimize exposure to blue light-emitting screens, such as TVs, computer monitors, and cell phones at night, or use a blue light filter on these devices. 
Sleep: Aim for a minimum of 8 hours of sleep per night. Avoid using an alarm to wake up, and compensate for any sleep deficit within the same week.

(4) Physical Activity 
The human body has evolved to accommodate a physically active lifestyle. The lymphatic system, which serves as our body's janitorial service, collects metabolic waste. However, unlike the blood circulatory system, it lacks a pump and depends on bodily movement to operate effectively. Therefore, it's essential to move regularly throughout the day. It is advised to engage in movement for 5 minutes every hour while awake. One method to monitor this is by counting your steps, aiming to reach at least 10,000 steps daily.

(5)  Emotional & Spiritual Health
Human emotions trigger the release of hormones that benefit not only our emotional well-being but also our physical health. We commonly hear that laughter is the best medicine because it helps alleviate stress. Similarly, giving unconditional love and surrounding oneself with recipients of such love, like young children and pets, significantly impacts our health. Additionally, prayers filled with gratitude saturate our bodies with hormones that promote happiness and contentment. The act of praying is crucial, regardless of the deity or entity being addressed. 
These five pillars of health, when consistently practiced and integrated into one's lifestyle, can help reverse many chronic diseases, if not all, and extend one's lifespan. This is similar to the patterns observed in various Blue Zones around the world, where people live over 100 years without diseases. Over next few weeks we will focus on these five pillars of health one at a time.

[12/8/25, 7:44:47 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •First Pillar of Health•
              FOOD. 

The most important of the five pillars of health is food. However, it's not just about what we eat; it also matters when we eat, how we eat, and what we do to our food before eating. My experience with 200,000 members has shown that a plant-based whole-food (PBWF) diet is optimal for humans. As we discuss the diet and lifestyle changes needed to treat chronic diseases, we must prioritize the bigger picture. Our goal is to significantly improve one’s health from its current state and to ideally eliminate the need for medications related to lifestyle diseases. My focus is on providing instructions that are simple and easy to remember. Here are my dietary recommendations:

(1) Avoid Animal Foods
No meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or dairy-based products such as yogurt, cheese, and ghee. Here are the reasons for this recommendation:
   - Animal foods are rich in protein. As discussed in my earlier blog (February 11), excess protein must be converted into fat and nitrogen by the liver, then into ammonia and uric acid, causing the liver and kidneys to work harder, potentially leading to the need for dialysis and transplants in later years.
   - Animal protein includes IGF-1, a hormone that promotes rapid cell growth. For example, a newborn calf weighing 50 pounds can grow tenfold to become a 500-pound bull. While human cells cannot grow that fast due to genetic modulation, cancer cells can thrive in the presence of IGF-1.
A metaphor I use is that while a lawn fed with potent fertilizer cannot grow faster, the weeds within it can. Similarly, tiny cancer cells in our body, common in most civilized populations, can grow rapidly due to IGF-1, thereby promoting cancer. 
   - Animal foods lack fiber, which is essential for feeding the microbes in our colon, potentially leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.
   - Animal foods are inflammatory and can cause atherosclerosis in our blood vessels, leading to various heart diseases.
   - The fat in animal food is mostly saturated fat, which is detrimental to cardiac health.

(2) Avoid Refined Foods
   - Refined foods such as oils, sugar, and white flour are devoid of fiber, moving slowly through the intestines, leading to full absorption of macronutrients and leaving little for the microbes residing in the colon. This can cause the microbes to consume the mucosal layer that protects the internal lining of the colon, leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.
   - Refined foods are quickly absorbed, overburdening our liver. This can lead to the formation of unwanted fat in the liver (causing fatty liver and NAFLD), visceral organs (visceral fat), and between muscle cells (intramyocellular lipids). Intramyocellular lipids block insulin receptors in our muscle cells, causing insulin resistance, a precursor to type-2 diabetes.

(3) Avoid Ultra Processed Foods 
Ultra-processed foods, like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), used as a sweetener in many processed foods, are devoid of fiber and contribute to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, they contain many chemicals labeled as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), yet they are not truly safe and cause numerous health issues. For instance, hydrogenated vegetable shortenings sold as margarine, and other products like Dalda and Crisco, have been found to be harmful and banned in many countries.

(4)  Eat from all five food groups
The five food groups are fruits, vegetables, beans & legumes, grains, and nuts & seeds. Regular consumption of herbs & spices is also highly recommended. Aim to consume one-fifth of your daily caloric intake from each food group, though this can vary daily. To accelerate weight loss, consume only the minimum recommended amount from the Nuts & Seeds group. Aim to eat at least 1% of your body weight in fruits (including berries) and vegetables (half from green leafy vegetables) daily.

(5) Five Nutrients Require  Special Attention 

 Monitor these key nutrients closely: Omega-3, vitamins D-3, B-12, and K-2, and iodine. To ensure adequate Omega-3 intake, consume one tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia seeds, along with a few walnuts each day. Include a variety of seeds and nuts; try to eat one Brazil nut each week as it is rich in selenium and also include pumpkin seeds. Take a vitamin B-12 supplement—either 50-100 mcg daily or 2,000 mcg weekly. Vitamin D-3 is best obtained from sun exposure. Only take a D-3 supplement if you are deficient and do not get much sun exposure. For vitamin K2 consume some fermented foods and also sauerkraut. It also helps to consume some sea greens like seaweed and algae as they are rich in iodine, Omega-3 and can provide some vitamin D and B12. Some examples are wakame salad, nori and kelp flakes.

(6) Keep Your Body Hydrated 
Drink a minimum of half a liter of warm water first thing in the morning before brushing your teeth, a glass an hour after dinner, and another glass before going to bed. Rest of the day, "eat" your water by consuming fresh fruits and vegetables rich in water content.

The first six of my Daily Dozen recommendations for diet and lifestyle include:

No other restrictions are there. Enjoy a variety of foods, including those you like and some you may not. Eat as much as you like but never beyond the point of liking. No portion control is necessary. After a year on the PBWF/IF/10K program (PBWF diet with 16:8 Intermittent Fasting and 10,000 steps daily), you should be able to rely on your body’s instincts to choose food and portion sizes.
Another rule of thumb is that at least half of your caloric intake should come from uncooked foods. Following these guidelines should naturally lead to this balance. Consider including sprouted beans to increase your intake of raw foods.

How To Cook Without Oil?
Many Indians feel at a loss because they aren't sure how to cook vegetables without using ghee or oil. Here are a few tips:
1. Sauté onions in a few tablespoons of water or vegetable stock.
2. Use spices that have been dry-roasted separately.
3. Incorporate nut butters like peanut or cashew butter.
4. Continue with your normal cooking process.
5. Use air fryers instead of deep frying, or opt for baking.
6. Add avocados to dough for making rotis or stuffed parathas. Avocados contain 80% fat.

Please note that in my recommendations, you are permitted to use nut or seed butters (pastes). This ensures that all dishes, including Pulao and Khichri, turn out perfectly. The only exceptions are deep-fried dishes, but you can use air fryers for those.

[12/8/25, 7:44:48 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Pillar-1 Food: Meal Plans

Many people request daily meal plans due to confusion about what to eat. As outlined in my guidelines from last week, our diet program offers complete freedom in choosing foods, provided they are plant-based whole foods (PBWF) and consumed within a narrow daytime eating window of 8-10 hours. Starting your day with green juice, fruits, nuts, and seeds for breakfast covers three of the five essential food groups, giving you flexibility for lunch and dinner. Here are some guidelines for a daily PBWF meal plan, assuming your eating window is from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Adjustments can be made for different eating windows.

BREAKFAST
10:00 AM: A glass of green juice
10:20 AM: A large bowl of fresh fruits and berries
 10:30 AM: Oatmeal or porridge made with nut milk and dates as a sweetener. Idli, Poha, Upma or similar PBWF items. This meal can also be combined with lunch, the choice is yours.

LUNCH
12:40 PM: A glass of green juice 
1:00 PM: Choose any PBWF dish made with grains, beans, legumes, or starchy vegetables. Examples include Daal/Roti, Daal/Rice, Khichri, Peas Pulao, Bisibhili Bhat, Idli, Dosa, Uttapam, Upma etc.

SNACK (Optional)
4:00 PM: Tea or coffee and/or fruits and/or dry fruits

DINNER
5:10 PM: A glass of green juice or  salad. 
5:30 to 6:00 PM: Any PBWF dish of your choice.

Note: The third glass of juice can be eliminated once you are off all medications, and the second glass can also be stopped after a year of no medications. Ensure you meet your daily intake of one tablespoon of Flax/Chia seeds and a few walnuts, although those watching their weight may limit this amount. Also, take a Vitamin B-12 supplement, with any meal. Remember, there is total flexibility with the meal menu.Any grains, beans, legumes, and starchy vegetables are acceptable.
You can make anything out of dosa batter; it takes care of two food groups: 
Daal
Rice
In the long run your body will guide you, by making you feel like eating one thing or the other. After 12 months on PBWF diet, you cannot go wrong, if you listen to your body. 
It would not be possible today,because there might be some unhealthy habits that need to be overcome first. It is a good idea to include a salad in your meal or have a salad as a meal. 

Meal Plan Suggestions
Many people ask me as to what I eat for meals and what can be made with zero oil and zero sugar. Here is a list of foods regularly consumed at our home.

[12/8/25, 7:44:59 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Every body has to find their own taste buds. Do not eat something because it is socially the in thing. For example I have watched the younger hip crowds paying a lot of money for extra virgin olive oil and boasting about it. Why can’t you just have olives. Olives are healthy, olive oil is not. 

Few Additional Comments
Stop looking for vegan alternatives to foods like fake meat hamburgers etc. Please remember your goal is to avoid processed foods also. Processed, prepackaged foods are full of additive which are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) but truly aren’t. 
Learn to make various chutney’s, and keep them ready in your refrigerator. They can add taste to any otherwise bland food. Tamarind chutney (Sonth) makes any food finger licking good. I find making chaats very easy for a quick meal and chaats have zero oil. 
It is important to note that oil free food doesn’t mean spice free. Spices are rich in antioxidants and must be consumed with every meal. This plan ensures that you can enjoy a healthy, varied diet while adhering to PBWF principles, providing flexibility and promoting long-term health benefits.

[12/9/25, 7:14:39 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• GREEN JUICING •••

Based on my experience in various health groups, I'd like to share four key insights:
1. Ease of Adoption: 
Some health advice is easier said than done. For example, consuming green leafy vegetables without using oil or ghee is challenging in Indian cuisine, where saag is a common preparation requiring these fats.
2. Dietary Changes: 
It is often hard to give up our favorite foods even when we know they are unhealthy. However, introducing tasty, healthy options can naturally displace less healthy choices.
3. Impact of Changes:
Gradual changes often yield less noticeable improvements which can lead to a loss of confidence. Making a few dramatic changes can keep these efforts top of mind and encourage persistence.
4.Ripple Effects:
A single conscious change can lead to multiple subconscious improvements and accrue significant benefits. For example, starting a daily walking routine led me to naturally reject calorie-dense snacks like cookies and donuts, mindful of the effort I'd put into walking.

Why Green Juice?
Green leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which help release Nitric Oxide in the bloodstream, unclogging blood vessels and reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues.
When I discussed dietary guidelines I mentioned that we need to consume a minimum 1% of our body weight in vegetables and half of that should be in green leafy vegetables. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn suggests six daily servings of green leafy vegetables for heart patients, including notable individuals like Bill Clinton. Given the culinary habits in India where salads are uncommon, I recommend juicing as a practical alternative, although it's second to consuming greens raw or blanched.
I recommend watching the documentaries “Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead" available on Netflix, and "Super Juice Me" on YouTube. These showcase dramatic health transformations through extended juice fasts. Inspired by these, I started with a five-day juice fast 11 years ago that transformed my life.
One should start with a 3-5 day juice fast, consuming 8-12 ounces of juice four to five times a day. After that continue with three glasses daily 15-20 minutes before meals to maximize health benefits until you can reduce or eliminate chronic medications.
The main goal here is to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetables (fruits should be eaten as a whole or to just make vegetable juice tastier). Juicing makes it easy. 

Selecting A Juicer
As green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed, especially for people who are on medications or want to lose weight. 
Consider hydraulic, double helical screw, and single augur juicers based on your budget and needs. Avoid high-speed centrifugal juicers as they can degrade nutrients and are less effective with leafy greens.
For patients who are critically ill, it is advisable to consume juice with minimum pulp. It is light on their stomach and for the same amount of fullness, they can consume more nutrients. (Not sure you need the last line re: cancer here since you mention critically ill above). 

Do You Lose Fiber?
A question often asked is “aren’t you removing fiber in juicing?”
The answer is that there are two types of fiber- soluble and insoluble. Juicing retains soluble fiber and some of the insoluble fiber as well. One should eat fruits as a whole and juice only vegetables. You can add some fruit to enhance the taste and yes Granny Smith apples because they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables. 
There is a saying: First thing in the morning, if you poop before you finish peeing; you are in good health. You soon will experience that.

Green Juice Recipe
Before diving into the recipe, it's important to note that there isn't a strict chemical composition required for making juice. Unlike the precise formulations often found in Ayurveda, the primary aim of juicing is to enjoy consuming green leafy vegetables in a tasty beverage, rather than enduring a bitter concoction solely for health benefits. Since everyone's taste preferences vary, feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your liking. The goal is to create a juice that's so delicious, your guests will ask for a second glass. 

Consider the recipe as consisting of three main groups of vegetables, along with some seeds:
1. Apples and Spice Group: This includes four Granny Smith apples (or any other suitable juicing apples), two lemons, and two thumb-sized pieces of ginger.
2. Hydration Group: Comprising one bunch of celery, one large English cucumber (or two medium regular cucumbers), and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the juice's water content, and you can easily double these ingredients if desired.
3.Leafy Greens Group: Choose any combination of one to three of the following: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beetroot greens, cabbage, etc. (2-3 bunches total). Alternatively, for a variation, replace this group with carrots and beetroots.

Enhance your juice by adding some flax seeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds. These seeds not only fulfill part of your Omega-3 needs but also provide fats that aid in nutrient absorption. Don't hesitate to include other non-starchy vegetables like bottle gourd, butter melon, raw turmeric, and mint. There are no restrictions—let your taste buds guide you!

Here is a typical green juice mixture in my kitchen. See in the picture from left to right:
Chard, Kale, Arugula, Bottle Gourd, Romaine lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Beetroot, Raw Turmeric root, Green apple, Carrot and Fenel. 

Shelf Life
Juice can be stored safely in airtight glass bottles in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours or frozen for longer storage, leaving space for expansion.

Organic vs Nonorganic
Always thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables. Seek organic sources if possible, but don't avoid conventional produce out of fear of pesticides; the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh the potential risks.
I recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market near you. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will remember you and always tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided. 

JUICE vs SMOOTHY 
This is one of the most frequently asked questions and there clearly is big confusion on this subject, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this. Before proceeding I want to make it clear that eating leafy greens raw as salad or blanched is the best option. The chewing action in the mouth mixed with saliva provides the most nutrition and absorption. Fruits ofcourse shoul always be eaten as whole fruits except some green apples (Granny Smith variety in US as they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables) which should be added to green juice. So the question is only, what is the second best option. 
1. Smoothies require high speed blending, this makes the air oxidize the nutrients. So you have some nutrient loss due to oxidization.
2. Because you have to mix a cup of water to start the process and because the pulp is retained, there are only half as many nutrients in a glass of smoothie as opposed to a glass of juice. 
3. Because of air and insoluble fiber you can not consume much smoothie and make up for reduced nutrients by drinking more. On the contrary the juice feels less filling than smoothie. 
4. A good juicer retains most of the soluble fiber in juice. Some of the insoluble fiber is also retained in small particles that go through the screen. The remaining insoluble fiber which is rejected, has little nutrient left. It is also not needed for bowl movement because one gets more than enough from juice. 
5. Juice does not stay in stomach much and passes through to small intestine quickly. Smoothies need to be digested and remain much longer in the stomach. Smoothies are not a good choice for juice fasts. 
6. Juice has a much longer refrigeration shelf life. You can juice only twice a week and store it in airtight glass bottles. It can also be frozen so one can reduce juice making to even once a week. 

This post clarifies green juicing, its benefits, and its practical implementation, aiming to promote better health practices and dietary adjustments.

[12/9/25, 7:14:41 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD YOU REALLY DRINK?

Social media is awash with adviceeon water consumption—recommending specific amounts to drink daily, detailing when and how to drink it, and even touting it as a cure for numerous ailments. My aim with this blog is to address these topics and clarify the confusion created by such claims.
The renowned Mayo Clinic suggests a daily water intake of 2.7 liters for women and 3.7 liters for men. While it's true that dehydration can lead to health issues, many of the claims about water curing illnesses are exaggerated and lack evidence. I recently spoke with a cancer patient who had increased his water intake to 3 liters per day in hopes of healing. While this hope is not harmful as long as he continues with necessary treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and avoiding angiogenic foods, it's important to set realistic expectations.
Water is crucial for maintaining various balances within the body, such as pH and mineral levels. Consider a New Yorker who subsists on a diet rich in meat, potatoes, coffee, and alcohol, with little to no water consumption; they might experience health issues that could be somewhat alleviated by drinking more water. However, this doesn't imply that increasing water intake can cure all individuals suffering from similar ailments. This is a common misconception promoted by many online videos and claims.
By understanding the true benefits and limitations of water consumption, we can approach our health more effectively and avoid falling for unfounded claims.

Benefits of Drinking Water
- Improves blood volume and viscosity
- Boosts your energy level
- Flushes out toxins and keeps your organs healthier
- Improves skin
- Promotes weight loss
- Enhances muscle contraction
- Improves hormone production
- Reduces joint pain
- Reduces stress hormones

The amount of water you need depends on several factors including your health, activity level, climate, and importantly, your diet—a factor often overlooked in mainstream media. 
Water aids in maintaining both alkalinity and sodium levels, suggesting that a diet high in alkaline foods and low in sodium (typically unprocessed) may reduce the need for excessive water to eliminate acidity or salt.
In a climate with temperatures ranging from 15-25 degrees Celsius and dry air (such as an air-conditioned environment), and assuming an activity level of 10,000 steps per day, a useful guideline is to drink 3-5% of your body weight in water. For instance, a person weighing 75 kilograms should consume 2.25-3.75 liters of water daily, equivalent to 9-15 glasses, assuming each glass holds 250 ml. If you're consuming 1% of your body weight in fresh fruits and 1% in vegetables daily (which are about 85% water), this accounts for approximately 1.7% of the 3-5% hydration needs. Thus, the remaining requirement is reduced to 1.3-3.3%, or 4-10 glasses of water daily.
For those avoiding non-vegetarian and processed foods, I suggest that 6 glasses per day may suffice. Consider drinking two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, one glass an hour after each meal, and one glass before going to bed. In hotter climates, like in India, it's advisable to drink a glass of water every time you come back from an outdoor trip. However, it's possible to drink too much water, which can lead to a loss of mineral balance. A practical way to assess your hydration level is by checking the color of your urine, which should ideally be at level 2 on a scale from 1 (clear) to 5 (dark yellow).
Note that acidic beverages and some types of acidic bottled water do not contribute to your total daily water intake.

Water with Meals or Not ?
Is it beneficial to drink water with meals? Opinions vary. Some sources recommend drinking warm or room-temperature water during meals to aid digestion, similar to the custom of drinking lukewarm green tea in Chinese and Japanese cultures. Others suggest waiting 45 minutes to an hour after eating before drinking water, claiming that it dilutes stomach acids and impairs digestion—though this lacks substantial scientific backing. The Mayo Clinic states that drinking water does not interfere with digestion.
An often overlooked factor in this debate is the type of food being consumed. For meals consisting of solid foods with low moisture content, drinking water or tea is advisable to aid in digestion. Many baked goods, such as bagels, muffins, cookies, or sweet potatoes, are difficult to swallow without the aid of a liquid. Similarly, most baked animal foods, unlike moisture-rich Indian curries, are low in moisture and may require water with meals. 
For those adhering to a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, which includes a substantial amount of fruits and vegetables and retains water and gravy in cooked items, there is less need to drink water during meals. However, I recommend taking one sip of water before starting to eat and a couple of sips at the end of the meal to aid in the functioning of the esophageal sphincter muscles and to facilitate oral hygiene. This aligns with the Hindu practice of taking a little water in your palm and circling it around your plate and swallowing it as a prayer before eating, and rinsing the mouth after meals. If it's not always feasible to spit the water out, swallowing it is perfectly acceptable, as it contains only the consumed food.
Water can be consumed during the meal if necessary, but it is advisable to drink it before starting and waiting about 45 minutes to an hour after finishing the meal.

Tulsi, Moringa or What?
A common question I encounter is about the practice of consuming various substances with morning water or on an empty stomach. It's crucial to understand that every plant food offers some benefits, but it's misleading to consider them in isolation. In India, it's widespread practice to add certain items as "superfoods," to your morning water. 
Most plant foods contain vitamins and minerals, their presence alone, as highlighted on social media, does not necessarily make them superior. Additionally, there's a practical issue with the advice to consume something on an empty stomach: how do you decide which should go first?
Once you have consumed one item, your stomach isn’t empty any more. 
I'm not opposed to consuming these items, but I advise treating them as part of your regular diet, not as supplements, and especially not outside your normal eating window. Believing they can compensate for deficiencies in your diet or lifestyle is a mistake. Here are some examples I often see: Lemon, Apple cider vinegar, Tulsi, Methi seeds, Moringa, Jeera, Ginger, Garlic, Aamla, Turmeric, Cinnamon, Curry leaves. The list goes on and on. 
My recommendation is to incorporate these into your recipes rather than consuming them as supplements, whether first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Consume them during your designated eating times, not during fasting periods.

Tea, Coffee or Chocolate ?
On the topic of tea, it's interesting to note that the British introduced tea to India around 180 years ago during their trade conflicts with China. While tea does contain some nutrients, the benefits are often offset when milk and sugar are added. A healthier alternative would be herbal teas, such as hibiscus, ginger, lemon, or cinnamon, which provide more nutrients without the need for additives like milk and sugar. 

Coffee, similarly, is not native to India. It was first introduced to the Karnataka hills in the 1670s. The issue with beverages like tea, coffee, and chocolate lies in the caffeine content, which is addictive—similar to other substances like tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, and opium. Addiction can dominate your life, dictating your actions and even basic functions like using the bathroom. Skipping your usual dose can lead to headaches and a general inability to function. Thus, I recommend trying to break free from this dependency. Some people may succeed in quitting cold turkey while others might prefer a gradual approach.

From a health perspective, all three beverages contain nutrients that are beneficial, but not when consumed in the typical way with added milk and sugar, which offset these benefits. If you choose to consume them, it's best to do so without these additions and in moderation. Consider starting by eliminating milk and sugar from your beverages. Opt for black tea with lemon or cardamom, or try Kashmiri Kahwa, which contains neither sugar nor milk. Green tea is another excellent option.

You might also notice that biscuits or donuts often accompany tea or coffee with milk. Eliminating milk from your tea or coffee can make it easier to stop consuming these snacks as well. I personally quit drinking tea ten years ago. For first few years I missed the routine of having a cup of hot beverage in the morning now even the idea doesn’t cross my mind.
