[9/30/25, 9:03:36 PM] Lalit Kapoor: ••••   WELCOME   ••••

Welcome all to this health group! The purpose of this group is to empower you to take control of your health and, ideally, reduce or eliminate the need for medications used to manage lifestyle-related diseases. This will be achieved through education on a Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, active living, Intermittent Fasting (IF), and a therapeutic fasting-based lifestyle.

Housekeeping Rules
1.Please avoid posting greeting messages.
2.Do not share forwarded content unless accompanied by your own detailed commentary.
3.Discussions must remain focused on chronic health issues.
4.Limit two-way conversations to one round only.
5. No solicitations are allowed.

My Introduction:
Many members may not know me, so let me introduce myself.

My name is Lalit M. Kapoor, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area—specifically in Berkeley. I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1971 and moved to UCLA in 1973 to complete my MBA. I’ve been living in the U.S. ever since.

After successfully selling the companies I started, I retired from business in 2005. Since then, I have pursued health and anti-aging research as a personal passion.

Twelve years ago, I watched the documentary Forks Over Knives, which deeply resonated with me. I was inspired to adopt the PBWF lifestyle recommended by several doctors featured in the film. Within 18 months, I lost 50 pounds and discontinued five prescription medications. Conditions I overcame include diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, gout, sleep apnea, and seasonal allergies. I felt more energetic than I had in decades—even completing my first half-marathon.

In 2017, I created a WhatsApp group for my 1971 IITK batchmates to share my experience. Many reported similar results and successfully reduced or eliminated their medications. As the group grew through referrals, I went on to create over 600 health groups and have coached more than 300,000 members.

Based on that experience and continued learning and new research in the fields of nutrition and health, I’ve fine-tuned my recommendations. Many members now see improvement within just two weeks. Your progress will depend on your medical history and how consistently you follow the guidance. I made my changes at age 63; others have seen results even at 85. I’ll share their stories with you along the way.

I will be assisted by Meenakshi Nigam in posting regular content and coaching you through this journey. We will also share short videos and lectures by leading doctors and professors from institutions like UCSF, USC, and Cleveland Clinic. Most videos are 5–10 minutes, with a few longer talks. I strongly encourage you to watch them, as my posts will be brief and may not cover every detail. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words; a video is worth a thousand pictures.

You’ll have the opportunity to ask questions, but based on experience, many early questions are answered in subsequent posts. For that reason, Q&A sessions will begin after the first two weeks and occur once per week. During this time, member posting will be paused and reopened periodically for questions.

During the first three weeks the focus will be on:
• What to eat and what not to eat
• When to eat and when not to eat
• How to cook and eat mindfully
• How to detoxify our body
• Physical activity
• Emotional Health
• Spiritual Health

During fourth week we will cover the political landscape of the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, and explore the influence of government and media.

Beginning this month the course has been split into two modules. The second module which focusses on Chronic diseases will be offered separately beginning November.  

As the course progresses, many members begin to see health improvements and share their stories. Most people who follow the guidance are able to discontinue some or most of their medications within months—especially those with hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. While some conditions lack clear metrics, it is difficult to assess progress. Most members report feeling younger and more energetic. 

It is highly recommended that members of the group share the posts with their spouses and watch the videos and documentaries together. The enrollment in WhatsApp groups has now stopped, please don’t send any requests for adding members. I start a new group every month. 

Past participants report spending 45–60 minutes daily during the first month, reading posts and watching videos. At the end of the one month program, you will be invited to join a geographically organized group of alumni for continued activities and support.

While we waited for others to join, I recommended you watch Forks Over Knives. If you haven’t, please do so immediately. Also, watch its companion documentary Forks Over Knives: Extended Interviews. I will post a list of other documentaries soon.

If you are seriously ill or facing urgent medical decisions please consult your physician. 
Please do not contact me directly. All questions should be asked in the group. With many groups and thousands of members running in parallel—including repeat participants—I ask that everyone follow the group’s pace and not skip ahead.

Thank you.

[9/30/25, 9:03:37 PM] Lalit Kapoor: MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (1)

By definition, a myth is "a widely held but false belief or idea." Where do they originate? Most myths are historical and long-held beliefs debunked with scientific knowledge gained through the advancement of science. However, in the modern world of social media, many myths can be intentionally implanted and quickly spread. Sometimes, even in the presence of evidence to the contrary, some myths continue to be propagated by vested interests.

Myth: HUMANS EVOLVED AS HUNTERS
Humans evolved as primates about 65 million years ago. Then, around 7 million years ago, we separated from Chimpanzees to Homonins with large brains and smaller teeth and bipedality. Homosapiens evolved about 2 million years ago. As humans evolved, most lived in temperate climates where there was an abundance of fresh produce throughout the year. The control over fire was only achieved about 400 thousand years ago. Prior to that, cooking was not an option. The idea of consuming raw meat in the presence of fresh fruits and vegetables seems unimaginable. Once we controlled fire it is safe to assume people might have moved into the temperate climate zones of Western civilizations, where winters are cold, and food does not grow for 6 months in a year, so societies evolved out of necessity to become meat eaters.
Also, until we evolved into the Bronze Age, there were not any tools available for hunting. Can you imagine hunting a buffalo or even a goat or deer with stones? Early humans were more likely to be gatherers and scavengers as opposed to hunters. In addition, human physiology with long intestines and a small jaw and teeth structure suggests that we evolved eating plant-based diets.

FRESHWATER FISH
The only exception appears to be that of freshwater fish. As we moved from one place to another in search of food, we must have camped at places near freshwater. Fish were not so difficult to catch even in the Stone Age. Fish in its raw form is also not intolerable to our palate, as many  who eat Japanese Sushi would attest.

HUMAN SETTLEMENTS 
As humans started farming and domesticating animals, we must have started consuming animal milks, eggs, and meat. Eating a cooked masala omelet is much more palatable than raw eggs. The only food processing we were familiar with was peeling, chopping, grinding, mashing, shredding, etc. The concept of ultra-processed food really came into existence during the last century with industrialization. The necessity of feeding soldiers during the two World Wars led to the evolution of food processing and packaging industries. After the wars were over these food companies, with their excess capacities, started marketing more and more ultra-processed foods to the masses.

Myth: TAKE A PILL WHEN ILL
The belief that when you are sick, you should take medicine, and the disease will go away started with the discovery of antibiotics 100 years ago. At the time, most dreaded diseases we faced were infectious diseases like Cholera, Typhoid, Smallpox, Polio, etc. The discovery of the antibiotic Penicillin in 1928 worked like a charm for such diseases. Over the years that followed, we as a society got accustomed to the idea of taking a pill when ill.

POST WORLD WAR 2 ERA
In the late 1940s, after the World Wars were over, Western governments ensured that food was inexpensive and plentiful. People had suffered food shortages for three decades due to depression and wars. Food got subsidized and even the poor started eating like kings. Chronic diseases, which earlier only affected the rich, became common. With the “take a pill when ill” psyche, it was natural for us to expect miracle drugs from our doctors, and they, along with the pharmaceutical industry, were quick to oblige. However, this time, the drugs did not cure the diseases so the doctors came up with the new explanation that lifestyle diseases are not curable, and doctors can only help manage them by keeping the symptoms in check through lifelong medications.

DISENCHANTMENT AMONG DOCTORS
Some doctors, who entered the medical field with a sincere desire to help humanity by curing diseases, slowly became disenchanted and started looking for answers elsewhere. They observed that, just like the wild animals of today and our ancestors of 10,000 years ago, all mammal’s organisms were self-healing, and symptoms were a natural compensatory response of the body. In a sense, symptoms are the messengers giving us clues that everything is not alright. 


By taking medications to suppress the symptoms we are only interfering with the body’s self-healing mechanism.

ULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD
Another observation was that over the years, the profit motive of the food industry had changed the nature of food to refined and ultra-processed food-like products that bore little resemblance to food as we knew it. To increase shelf life fiber was removed and, to increase sales, taste was improved by adding sugar and oils. Experts with PhDs in psychology were deployed to make food taste addictive and non-satiating so people would eat more and buy more. These ultra-processed foods, in fact, were (a) increasing the toxicity of the body and (b) creating deficiencies of nutrients.
In addition, the use of inorganic fertilizers and single-crop farming depleted the soil of trace minerals. The produce, though sumptuous and beautiful looking, lacked nutrients, especially micronutrients. Damming rivers to generate hydropower did not help either. As minerals settle down upstream, in the lakes created by dams, it further depletes the soil of trace minerals. Processed and refined foods are not only deficient in nutrients but also full of preservatives. To reduce cost and increase profits, new inexpensive products like hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrups were developed. Deficiencies of nutrients reduce the body’s immunity making it more susceptible to diseases. The abundance of animal food, which was only available to kings and aristocrats earlier, was now available to the masses and caused havoc with their health.
Finally, this new breed of doctors started to speak out, but their voices were muffled by the powerful lobby of the food, drug, and healthcare industries and the government, eager to please lobbyists with deep pockets. The Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement is the outgrowth of these pioneering voices.

WHAT IS A PBWF DIET?
A Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, as the name implies, consists of following:
- Only plant-based foods. No animal foods, no fish, eggs, or dairy. No butter or ghee.
- No Refined or ultra-processed foods. No sugar or vegetable oils or refined flours. Take corn for example: Corn on the cob, Corn Soup, Corn Starch and Corn Flour would be considered whole foods. Corn Flakes, Corn Oil  and High Fructose Corn Syrup would be considered Ultra-processed foods.

This concept of food as holistic medicine dates back to the period of Hippocrates who said, "let food be thy medicine." Hippocrates may have acquired this knowledge at Takshshila University of India: the world’s largest center of learning at the time. The latest research shows us that when you change your diet to plant based ehole food, your body begins to heal naturally and when your body heals, everything heals, including lifestyle diseases. This is the main theme of this blog as you will see in the weeks to come.

[10/2/25, 7:08:40 AM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: New Year Resolutions That Are Bound to Fail

On January 1, many of you are likely to have made resolutions to join the gym and start working out in new year. Food, along with its timing (as in circadian rhythm) and its absence (as in fasting), is the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and we often fail to recognize it. Physical exercise accounts for only 10-15% of our health yet we are completely enamored by it. What is the reason for such a disconnect?

Myth: IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT (You Are Eating Too Much and Not Exercising Enough)
These words have been repeated by doctors and our elders often referred to as "gluttony and sloth." Have you ever wondered why all mammals in the wild world don't have this problem and we humans didn't have it until a century ago? Wild animals eat as much as they’d like  as often as they’d like. A deer doesn't need a dietitian to dictate its diet. The reason we struggle might be simple: we are eating the wrong foods. The ultraprocessed foods we consume are designed for overconsumption by PhDs in psychology, circumventing our satiation mechanism.

FLAWED NUTRITION SCIENCE
Nutrition science, as it has evolved over the past century, has gone in the wrong direction of reductionism. Looking at nutrition as individual nutrients and ensuring we get enough by supplementing them worsen the situation. This approach has led to a population where the number of sick people outweighs that of healthy people. Nutrients in food work like a symphony, and focusing on individual nutrients turns a harmonious body into chaos.

ULTRA PROCESSED FOOD
The profit motive of the food industry has resulted in an increasing amount of ultra-processed food that is both addictive and non-satiating, circumventing human satiation mechanisms. Additionally, calorie-dense and nutrient-poor food is prevalent. Soil depletion due to organized farming and damming of rivers has not helped either giving rise to a profitable supplements industry.

Our body is impacted not only by known nutrients but also by nutrients we have not yet discovered. Consuming natural foods provides us with a package of known and not-yet-known nutrients. Supplements, on the other hand, only offer the nutrients we know about. We are not overeating by choice; the problem lies in the food we consume. Someone profits from it, and we find ourselves captive to it.

Another fact, studied by Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF, is that when insulin levels are high (common when overeating refined foods), our body wants to conserve energy and avoids physical activity. It's not our fault that we don't want to exercise; it's a result of ultra-processed foods. We are not the problem - the problem is ultra-processed food.

I will be debunking many such myths that lead us to failure and worsen our health in my course You will learn what I call the Five Pillars of Health, a blueprint for wellbeing that, when followed, can rejuvenate your health and make you feel years younger.

[10/2/25, 7:08:41 AM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (2)

MYTH: EAT EVERYTHING IN MODERATION
These are “words of wisdom” often uttered by many respectable people including our elders and doctors. The problem with this advice is that when we consume everything in moderation, we also get diseases in moderation. This myth is so pervasive in our society that we have come to expect old age diseases as normal part of aging. What if we are wrong? In fact, we are wrong and it was proven 24 years ago when National Geographic commissioned a study with Dan Buettner, widely known as the Blue Zone Study.

Blue Zone Study
Dan Buettner identified five communities worldwide with the longest living people: Okinawa (Japan), Sardinia (Italy), Icaria (Greece), Nicoya (Costa Rica) and Loma Linda (California, USA). These places showcased individuals living to 100-105 years without the prevalence of lifestyle diseases associated with old age.
Lessons learnt from these zones include a simple lifestyle, absence of modern processed foods, and daily activities involving over 10,000 steps. 

OUR ANCESTORS LIFE

Our ancestors in India really did not live long lives. I remember in the 1950’s, if someone lived beyond 75-80 years, his death was celebrated as a life well lived. Today, at the age of 74, I shudder at that thought. 

How Many Diseases?
Estimates suggest around 10,000 diseases afflict humans, and the field of medical sciences continues to specialize with over 135 medical specialties. The lack of centralized monitoring for medications prescribed by specialists adds complexity to addressing negative side effects and adverse drug reactions.

MYTH: DIFFERENT DIETS FOR DIFFERENT DISEASES
Most people have a belief that there must be a different diet plan recommendation for different illnesses. The most common question asked in my health groups is “I suffer from X, Y and Z. What should I eat?”  Food should be healthy to prevent all diseases, if not, it would create an unresolvable dilemma as to what diseases should I treat and which ones suffer. This is likely one or the biggest myth of all and is continuously propagated by many dietitians, doctors, naturopaths and health spas. Just imagine you are suffering from diseases X, Y and Z and you are prescribed the following diet:

-For disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P
-For disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R and avoid  C, G, M, S & Q
-For disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S and avoid  A, G, K, P & T

How would you figure out what to eat and what to avoid? The premise that there is a special diet for every disease is fundamentally flawed. When you eat a Plant Based Whole Food diet, with a diverse variety of foods in each food group, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and it heals. And when body heals everything heals. 

Self Selection
When we look around in wilderness we find that animals living there eat whatever they want whenever they want and as much as they want. Why are humans are incapable of doing that? Why do we have to consult a dietitian to find out what to eat, what not to eat, how much to eat and when to eat it? During the 1930s many studies were done on this subject of self selection and it was found that, over an extended period of time, animals were able to self select their food choices in a way that their bodies remained healthy without creating any deficiency or excesses. One such study done in Canada in the 1930s on young children found that over a period of 6 months when children were left to themselves to select their food, from a buffet of varied choices, they did fine and there were no deficiencies or excesses. It was concluded that among young children the process of self selection works fine. 

So the question arises as to why we lose this innate ability to self select our own food. The answer lies in the fact that we human are social animals and as we grow up our decisions are based on more than physiology. We start consuming foods not necessarily because we find them tasty and rewarding but also because they fulfill our psychological needs: to show off, feel grown up or to belong to a certain clique. Many addictions like tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco start that way. Nobody likes these at first and many find their taste and feel unpleasant. 

Designer Foods 
Some foods are designed in ways to create a dopamine response that we find rewarding like refined fat and sugar. Even these foods, if not tinkered with by specialists, are likely to satiate us quickly and not lead to much overconsumption. However, when foods are designed by expert psychologists who know how to circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism we fall prey to them, wanting to eat more and more. The best example to make this point is potato chips. When you make them at home you can’t eat more than a dozen or so without feeling satiated. When you eat Pringles chips you can keep eating one after another until the box is empty. In fact, the company took pride in that and their advertising tag line was “Once you pop, you can't stop.” It is important to take conscious approach to our dietary choices.

Diet Alone is Not the Solution
Similarly looking for all solutions in diet alone is also a flawed approach and needs correction. Recent research and Nobel prizes awarded in 2016, 2017 and 2018 have shown that when to eat (as in Circadian Rhythm) and when not to eat (as in fasting) are often equally important. In addition, the new science of microbes colonizing our colon called Epigenetics is creating a paradigm shift in our understanding of nutrition and diseases. Its impact is still not well understood but we are getting many clues. 

Many people do not follow lifestyle recommendations like intermittent fasting or Ekadashi fasting or Navratri fasting which are essential for detoxifying the body. Also many people eat late dinners (after it is dark outside) and go to bed shortly thereafter. These lifestyle choices impact our health in ways we are only beginning to understand. 

In the coming weeks we will delve into lifestyle choices, like fasting, and their impact on health. Stay tuned.

[10/2/25, 7:08:42 AM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Myth: HUMANS ARE VERY SIMILAR

It's been commonly assumed in medical research that all humans are similar, and therefore, findings from a small group can be generalized across the population, aside from racial and socioeconomic variations. Humans are indeed genetically similar, which underpins the belief that clinical studies on one group are applicable to others if they share racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of the recent studies have shattered this myth beyond doubt beginning with Human Genome Project.  

Human Genome Project (1990-2003)
This project involved six of the world's wealthiest countries, including the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, France, and the UK. The U.S. alone invested 3 billion dollars in the project, which aimed to map an individual's genome and predict their medical future, similar to a medical horoscope. However, the results revealed a surprising complexity, with human genes outnumbering expectations by a hundredfold. The mystery unraveled when it was discovered that the human body contains about 38 trillion foreign cells, mainly microbes in the colon, outnumbering its own 37 trillion human cells. These microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, constitute our microbiota, with their genetic material forming our microbiome, significantly influenced by our diet and lifestyle.

Human Microbiome Project (2007 - Present)
To study the effects of bacteria on our health another project was undertaken in 2007 called the Human Microbiome Project. This resulted in a major shift in how we perceive and address health problems. For example we learned that:
1. Identical twins can be as much as 70% apart due to changes in their diet and lifestyle. 
2. The same cause can manifest as different symptoms among different people.
3. The same symptoms can stem from different causes in different people.
4. Diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science, often with hits and misses.

This new science is creating a whole new field of fecal transplantation. For example studies have shown that a fecal transplantation from a slim mouse into the colon of a fat mouse can make it lose weight easily within months. This is an active frontier in medical science today. 


Epigenetics was featured on the cover of TIME magazine in January 2010. A helpful way to grasp the distinction between genetics and epigenetics is to think of it in terms of a mobile phone's hardware and its application software. Essentially, the hardware in all mobile phones is quite similar regardless of the manufacturer. Yet, the phone's functionality and appearance can vary significantly depending on the software it runs. In a similar vein, while our genetic makeup (like the phone's hardware) is fundamentally the same, epigenetics (akin to the software) determines how these genes are expressed, leading to notable differences from one individual to another.

American Gut Project (2013-2018)
Another project, the American Gut Project, started in 2013, analyzed gut microbiome data from people from 45 countries. The findings released in 2018 unveiled many surprises. The study divided people into two groups—one consuming 10 or less plant-based foods and the other consuming over 30 different plant food varieties. The study found that the first group suffered from many metabolic diseases and had low immunity, while the second group had few diseases and rarely suffered from viral infections.

Myth: IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT (Overeating and Lack of Exercise)
When we visit a doctor and our first lifestyle disease is diagnosed (generally high Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, or Cholesterol), the doctors put the blame squarely on us saying “You are eating too much and not exercising enough" commonly referred to as "gluttony and sloth." The doctors don’t explain why we are doing so; it's not taught to them in medical colleges.
The reason is simple: we are eating the wrong foods. Ultraprocessed foods are designed for overconsumption by Ph.D.s in psychology. They circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism. 
I remember the night Al Gore lost US presidential election to Bush in November 2000, I was in Mumbai and bought a pint of Mumbai’s famous Natural’s custard apple ice cream. The election results were so close and interesting that I finished the whole pint of ice cream without even realizing it. I didn’t achieve the satiation point. My stomach was sick but mind wanted more. This is what is happening to most of us. We are not suicidal and we are not overeating by choice. The food is designed for over consumption. Somebody is profiting from it and got us captive. 
Dr. Robert Lustig of University of California, SanFrancisco has dedicated his life to research on this subject on obese children. He has found that when insulin levels are high (from overeating refined carbs), our body conserves energy and is less inclined to engage in physical activity. All these obese kids wanted to do was eat chips, cookies, ice cream and drink Cola and watch TV. They had no interest in playing outdoors. When their food was changed and insulin level reduced by medication, they started going out to play. We must understand that it is not our fault and it is definitely not a character flaw like gluttony and sloth in us as we are told. It is also the same ultra-processed foods (caloric dense nutrient poor) that make us deficient in nutrients. So as you can see the problem is not us the problem is the food. 

Myth: THE SOIL IS DEPLETED SO YOU NEED SUPPLEMENTS
The food supplements industry is $164 billion in the U.S. alone. There is some validity to the argument that due to damming of rivers and single crop farming, the soil has become depleted of many trace minerals. Plants produced today may not be as rich in nutrients as a century ago, but instead of taking supplements, increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can overcome these deficiencies.
As it is, our consumption of fresh produce has become a fraction of just two generations ago. So by simply increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables all deficiencies can be overcome. There is no need for supplements. The only exception is Vitamin B12 which our body made in the presence of a certain bacteria found in soil and ground water. As municipal supplies of water is chlorinated we do not get that bacteria. 
One must also understand that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about but how about the nutrients that are not-yet-known (NYKnowns). They are missing from the supplements and therefore supplements often cause imbalances. 
One classic example of this is a study that showed that cardiac patients who were given Beta Carotene supplements died earlier compared to the control group. This was because, (as we now know) there are 750 different carotenoids of which human body needs 50. By supplementing only Beta Carotene (known nutrient) body developed deficiency in other 49 carotenoids (NYKnowns at the time). 
In conclusion, eating a diverse variety of plant foods, avoiding processed refined foods, and supplements, and listening to your body's signals are key to achieving a proper nutrient balance.
[10/2/25, 6:37:12 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Myth: BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY•

What does “better safe than sorry” mean to you? 
Most people believe it is safer to continue taking certain medications rather than risk slightly elevated blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol levels. But WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.
In recent years, many senior doctors have realized that we've swung too far towards medicating lifestyle diseases. Studies from the past two decades suggest that excessive medication can often be more harmful than no medication at all. This phenomenon is known as the J-Curve. Progressive doctors have been vocal against overmedication for controlling blood pressure, sugar, and cholesterol. As a result, guidelines for medication thresholds have been revised. However, these changes haven't been widely disseminated, leading many doctors to follow outdated guidelines. 
Later in this blog, I'll present evidence supporting the revision of these guidelines towards more moderate medication thresholds. We'll also delve into the politics of the pharmaceutical, food, and healthcare industries, and examine the roles government and media play in our health.
Emerging evidence shows that previous approaches were flawed and potentially more harmful. Many doctors are now reevaluating their recommendations for treatment and testing. The increased specialization in medicine often leads to tunnel vision, neglecting the overall quality of life and mortality. Furthermore, our understanding of drug interactions is limited, and prescriptions from multiple specialists can lead to Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). I'll cover ADRs more in future blogs.

Human Body is Self Healing
"The human body is a remarkable self-healing mechanism, often smarter than we acknowledge. It adeptly copes with the diet and lifestyle it encounters. Elevated blood pressure, sugar, or cholesterol levels are often the body’s compensatory responses to various conditions.
However, the body struggles with synthetic medications. These substances are foreign and can disrupt the body's natural compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, they place a strain on the liver and kidneys, affecting them in ways not fully understood. 
To be safe, it's advisable to first address diet and lifestyle changes, allowing the body to naturally adjust these health markers. Of course, always seek medical advice and discuss your preferences with your doctor.

J -CURVE Concept
It's well-known that symptoms like high blood pressure or blood sugar are detrimental to health and, if uncontrolled, can lead to a shortened lifespan. Diseases typically follow a slanted S-curve, indicating that minor deviations from normal levels are less harmful and more manageable than more severe deviations. The impact on life expectancy isn't linear; a slight worsening of health markers is more concerning at advanced levels. For instance, a 10% increase in systolic blood pressure from 120 to 132 is concerning, but not alarmingly so. However, a 10% rise from 140 to 154 is significantly worrying. If it jumps 10% from 190 to 209, it becomes critical and demands immediate action.
We also know that all medications  have some negative side effects which may reduce our life expectancy. So clearly minimizing or eliminating medications should be a goal. Some BP patients are on a single pill which may not be as harmful, but some are on 6-7 different pills just for controlling BP. That situation is not at all desirable and if the person is also on diabetic or statin medications, it can harm in ways we do not fully understand. 


Given the considerations mentioned, many senior doctors are now questioning the wisdom of stringently controlling health markers with aggressive medication. Recent studies have been conducted to assess the impact of such medications and disease markers on overall life expectancy. These studies indicate that optimal results are often achieved with a moderate approach.

ACCORD Study
The Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, initiated in September 1999 and sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is a significant example. This study aimed to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control, blood pressure management, and multiple lipid management on major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study, a landmark in its field, was supported by several collaborators:
- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
- National Institute on Aging (NIA)
- National Eye Institute (NEI)
- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

The researchers initially hoped that tighter control of blood sugar and blood pressure would enhance life expectancy. However, within eight years, it became evident that such stringent controls were, in fact, increasing all-cause mortality rates among patients. Consequently, the duration of the study was curtailed, as it would have been unethical to continue exposing patients to such risks. The chart below presents the raw data from the ACCORD study, which the American College of Physicians (ACP) used to revise their diabetes guidelines in 2018. It is noteworthy that even they took a decade to update their guidelines.


The link to their announcement of March 6, 2018 is given below. 
https://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/acp-recommends-moderate-blood-sugar-control-targets-for-most-patients-with-type-2-diabetes

After the ACCORD study, many doctors called for a revision of the guidelines for blood pressure and blood sugar medications. In response, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-8) revised its blood pressure control guidelines in 2014 as shown below. 



The American College of Physicians updated their diabetes guidelines in March 2018. Both revisions faced objections from those whose income was most affected. In US, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) was pressured to disband the JNC, which had served for over four decades and transfer authority to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).
The American College of Physicians (ACP) 2018 diabetes guideline revision alarmed the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) so much so that they reinstated their own, more restrictive guidelines within seven days. I will discuss these issues in more detail in the coming months under the topic of the Politics of Diet & Health. For now, my aim is to inform you about the J-Curve and why it occurs. Many of you may not be aware of these recent revisions and could be overmedicating. I recommend discussing this with your healthcare providers as soon as possible.

[10/2/25, 6:37:16 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ☝
Please pay attention to the above chart. It is the data behind the ACP guidelines. The research had shown as far back as 2009 that aggressive treatment of diabetes by conventional methods leads to higher all cause mortality.
The lowest all cause mortality is for A-1C in the range of 7.5 to 8.2.
[10/3/25, 6:47:17 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• PROTEIN MYTH •••

There are many myths related to protein in our society propagated, knowingly or unknowingly, by many in the food and healthcare industries. These myths include the belief that 
* The human body needs a lot of protein
* Protein is hard to find in food  
* Plant protein is somehow inferior to animal protein and doesn’t contain all amino acids. 

Even the United State's Food & Drug Administration (FDA), in its MyPlate guidelines, suggests the need for special foods to consume protein, as implied in their recommendations below.

The problem with this MyPlate recommendation is that fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy all contain protein, creating a misconception that special foods are necessary. The past head of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health criticized these guidelines as "utterly ridiculous." 

Here are some facts pointing to the opposite conclusion:
- The human body needs very little protein, as evidenced by the low protein content in mother's milk, which fuels newborns who are at the fastest growth stage of their life. 
-All proteins are made up of 20 amino acids in a chain configuration. Our body is able to make 11 but the remaining nine amino acids have to be consumed. For that reason they are called essential. It has been a long held myth that some of these nine are absent from some plant foods. For example it was believed that rice does not have lysine and beans do not have methionine. It is for this reason it was recommended that grains and beans should be combined in a balanced diet. 
We now know that plant proteins contain all essential amino acids, but their distribution varies among food groups. Eating from all five food groups ensures no deficiency. However it is still a good idea to combine beans & legumes with grains as in daal-chawal (legume-rice) or Idli or Khichri. 
- Protein is abundantly found in plant foods. For example, as a percentage of total calories, rice has 7%, watermelon 8%, guava 14%, romaine lettuce 19%, and spinach 30%. Potatoes have a similar protein content to mother's milk at 5-6%.

History of Protein
Protein was discovered in 1839 by German scientist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named for the Greek word Proteios, meaning "of prime importance." The US Government, in 1947, established the minimum protein requirement for humans at 5-6% of total calories, They were so concerned about protein deficiency (due to popular beliefs that physical labor and gym enthusiasts need more protein) that they wanted to include 98% of the population in their Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and therefore recommended a high figure of 8-10 percent of total calories requirement which amounted to 0.8 gram per kilogram of body weight. This amounts to 48 grams (240 calories) for a person weighing 60 kilograms or 10% (assuming 2,400 total calories a day). We did not know until 1899 that plant foods also have protein. For a long time plant protein was considered inferior to animal protein because it was believed to lack all essential amino acids which is incorrect. 

Human Proteome Project (2011-Now)
Most people know about a project called the “Human Genome Project” which was undertaken in 1990. Few are aware of “Human Proteome Project” that was undertaken a few years later to map all the proteins in human body. The science emerging from this ongoing project is called Proteomics. For reasons unknown to me, the findings of the Proteome project are not picked up by the mass media or social media much. I believe it may have something to do with its potential impact on the food industry especially meat, poultry and dairy. Here is what we now know about proteins in the human body: 
* Most humans need very little protein, only about 8% of their total calories. 
* An average adult body produces around 250 grams of new proteins daily and breaks down a similar amount due to wear and tear.
* The body efficiently recycles spent proteins into amino acids for new protein synthesis, but certain proteins like nails, hair, and dead skin cannot be recycled, resulting in a 15% shortfall from the daily requirement for individuals burning 2,400 calories, equivalent to 36 grams.
* The US Government's conservative recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight covers 98% of the population, potentially leading to overconsumption by 97% of the population, statistically speaking. 
* Excessive protein, especially from animal sources, can be harmful to the liver and kidneys, shortening their healthy lifespan.
* Periodic protein absence as during fasting, promotes autophagy (the recycling of dead and damaged cells). Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi received the 2016 Nobel Prize for his discoveries.
* Prolonged protein absence (9-10 days) can contribute to building immunity against major diseases like cancer as acknowledged by the 2018 Nobel Prize given to Dr. Tasuku Honjo. Practices like the Navratri fast among Hindus and Peryushan fast among Jains share this health objective. 
* Individuals who perform intense workouts or manual labor obtain extra protein through increased calorie consumption, eliminating the need for richer protein foods as the body efficiently recycles most excess spent protein generated during exercise.

Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Minimum
The food industry in its zeal to sell more animal food, distorted the minimum and recommended guidelines established by the US government and somehow the recommended amount was labeled as the minimum. Even leading universities, which are now mostly governed by Food and Drug Industries, are guilty of these distortions as you can see by performing a google search on “protein”. Until recently this search revealed that these distortions appear on prestigious web sites such as Healthline, WebMD and Harvard Health, which I quote below:
“The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.”

The above statement was a total lie. The site has now been revised and shows a lower recommendation of 0.8 gram per kilogram only. It may surprise you to note that there is not a single recorded case of protein deficiency in the civilized world.  Ninety seven percent of all Americans eat too much protein while at the same time 97% of all American diets are deficient in dietary fiber. Fiber is not found in any animal food or ultra-processed food. The nutrient of concern therefore should be fiber and not protein. Sadly press coverages on dangers of excessive protein consumption do not exist and the topic is conveniently ignored by mass media. This is in spite of doctors such as Dr. Colin Campbell (Cornel University), Dr Christopher Gardner (Stanford University) and Dr.Janice Stanger (UCLA) speaking about it at major conferences and in various documentaries and YouTube videos. 

Why is Animal Protein Harmful?
All animal protein comes with the IGF-1 hormone. This hormone helps animals grow rapidly. For example a 50 pound newborn calf becomes a 500 pound bull in 6 months. The IGF-1 hormone is very harmful in humans as it promotes growth of cancer cells which are already present in the body fluids of most people living in the civilized world. 
To make my point I like to give an example of a popular fertilizer in the United States called “Miracle Grow”. This fertilizer makes lawn grow very lush and green. However the lawn does not grow any taller. The thickness of the lawn depends upon the variety of the grass. It would only rise few inches above the soil. But if there are any weeds in the lawn, miracle grow makes them grow very tall very fast. This is because the weeds do not have auto truncating mechanism in their genes. Similarly human body has a built in truncating mechanism dictated by our genes. Our ring finger cannot become longer than the middle finger. When we consume IGF-1 hormone, it expedites the growth but our body cannot grow disproportionately. However any cancer cells, that are present in our body, do grow rapidly in the presence of IGF-1 hormone. This is why cancer growth gets promoted upon consumption of the IGF-1 hormone that accompanies animal protein. 
A study by Padambhushan Dr. Gopalan and Madhavan at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad in 1967 had demonstrated that, in the presence of carcinogens and sufficient food, animal protein can cause cancer cells to grow (we will discuss this more when we discuss the dairy myth). 
Studies also show associations between animal protein consumption and increased renal cancer cases, elevated LDL cholesterol and higher blood sugar levels.

Why is Excess Protein Harmful?
Of the three macronutrients that provide energy to sustain life, only protein has nitrogen. The others, carbohydrates and fat, are made up of only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Our body has subcutaneous fat cells that can store an almost unlimited amount of fat; it can also store up to 2,000 calories of sugar but it has no provision to store protein. 
When we eat more protein than needed, which most of us in the civilized world do, our body faces a problem: What do we do with that extra protein? The liver, which is the chemical factory in our body, removes the nitrogen from the protein and makes fat and ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is toxic, so the body combines it with water and converts it to uric acid.
The kidneys then filter it out as urine. This taxes two of our critical organs: the kidney and liver. This is a leading cause for kidney and liver failures at later stages in life in the civilized world. Additionally, when there is excess uric acid it crystallizes and the body tries to move it as far away as possible and deposits it into the big toe as uric acid crystals. This condition is called gout. Many French paintings from the Renaissance period show over weight royalties suffering from this disease. 
As a society our protein consumption (from meat, eggs and dairy) has increased multi fold in the past seven decades after World War 2. This has led to the growth of many lifestyle diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart diseases, Strokes, Dementia, Kidney and Liver diseases.

Anti-Aging Benefits of Protein Restriction
Recent research in the anti-aging field suggests that of all the major factors helping with anti-aging, restrictions on protein consumption is the most important. It helps in many ways including 
1. Improves immunity
2. Decreases Oxidative stress
3. Decreases Inflammation
4. Decreases Insulin Resistance
5. Decreases cancer promoting growth hormones
The latest book by Dr. Greger “How Not To Age” deals with this subject in detail and I highly recommend it. 

Benefits of Occasional Protein Deficiency
The two Nobel prizes on fasting in 2016 and 2018 have demonstrated that absences of protein during fasting is very beneficial for human health. It leads to autophagy, whereby the body recycles its dead and damaged cells to get amino acids and make new cells. The net effect is that the body’s average cell age reduces. It is for this reason I recommend that one should keep Ekadashi and Navratri fasts. We will cover this subject in detail when we discuss the second pillar of health: Detoxification. 

Personal Case History
The Protein myth has been so prevalent in our society that I am reminded of the 1950’s when my grandfather insisted that I drink a glass of milk every morning with an egg yolk (not to mention the sugar which was always added to milk in India in those days). While I hated drinking it, I had no choice in the matter. Little did my grandfather know that he was causing me harm. He had the best of intentions and, based on the prevalent wisdom at the time, he was doing the right thing. 

Protein for Muscles?
Another misconception about protein is that eating protein builds muscles. If it was so easy, every man would look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Muscles develop when we exercise them. The famous gladiators of the Roman period 2,000 years ago, who had to fight for life every day, were all vegans. Please watch the documentary “The Game Changers”. This is also discussed in the documentary “Forks over Knives”. 

Conclusion
In conclusion, the emphasis on protein consumption, especially from animal sources, has led to widespread misconceptions and health issues in our society. It is crucial to reevaluate dietary guidelines and focus on a balanced and plant-based approach for overall well-being. 
Please read Dr. John McDougall’s article on the subject and

[10/4/25, 7:16:42 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••   DAIRY MYTH   •••

A long-standing, prevalent belief champions dairy as the perfect food. While it may indeed be ideal for calves it is not the case for humans. The perfect food for humans is human milk, and that too only during infancy. Humans are unique in two respects: (1) they continue milk consumption beyond infancy and (2) they consume the milk of another species. The origins of this practice are murky but it may have begun thousands of years ago during a famine. In desperate times consumption of cow’s milk, which led to survival, may have sparked the widespread domestication of cows.

This topic presents a personal conflict for me. Numerous doctors in the Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement advise against dairy, supported by a plethora of studies. However Ayurveda, an ancient Indian wisdom, endorses it, albeit sparingly. Most PBWF recommendations align with Ayurveda except for dairy products like milk and ghee.

All mammals nurse their young with milk specifically formulated for their offspring's growth rate. For instance, a calf grows tenfold in six months, necessitating a milk composition rich in proteins, fats, and growth hormones like IGF-1. These components, while beneficial for calves, can potentially fuel cancer cell growth in humans without affecting normal cells, akin to how fertilizers promote lawn growth but also enable weeds to flourish unchecked.

INDIAN STUDY ON DAIRY PROTEIN
A groundbreaking study in 1967 by Dr. Gopalan and Madhvan at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad (India) examined the effects of dietary protein levels on cancer development. Mice, injected with a carcinogen and fed diets of varying protein levels, showed a direct correlation between high dairy protein intake and cancer growth. This study, which initially perplexed many, including Dr. Colin Campbell, laid the groundwork for a significant shift in understanding the relationship between animal protein and cancer.

Dr. Campbell's subsequent research, including the comprehensive China Study, underscored the detrimental effects of animal proteins, particularly from dairy, on our health. These findings advocate for minimizing dairy and animal protein consumption in diets exceeding 8% total protein, especially in affluent societies with abundant food choices.

It's important to recognize that dairy products do not cause cancer - they only contribute to its progression. The initiation of cancer is primarily due to gene mutations, which can result from a variety of factors such as radiation and toxic chemicals present in our environment. This suggests that cancer-causing agents were less prevalent in ancient times. 
In scenarios of food scarcity, dairy protein can be considered a viable nutritional option. Historically milk likely played a crucial role during times of famine, potentially saving many communities from extinction. It is also worth noting that gene mutations caused by toxic chemicals and radiation were presumably less common in the past due to the limited presence of these harmful agents.

In 1967, the per capita milk consumption in India was 107 ml per person- today it has quadrupled to 427 ml per person. This increase occurred despite widespread knowledge of milk's potential role in promoting health issues, including cancer. While the Government of India recognized Dr. Gopalan's contributions with the Padma Bhushan award, his advice on this matter was not heeded.

Why Milk Today is Harmful Compared to The Past
Today's dairy products differ significantly from those our ancestors consumed and we face different health challenges. Factors contributing to the harm caused by modern dairy include industrial farming practices, the genetic composition of dairy cows and the increased presence of environmental carcinogens. Additionally, lifestyle changes and increased life expectancy call for a reevaluation of dairy's role in our diet. Here are some examples:
* Dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination. 
* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.
* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield. 
* They are injected with high-dose antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions. 
All these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk cows produce and are very harmful to human health. 

Life expectancy in the olden days was low and an age of 70-80 was considered a life long lived. Very few lived beyond that. Today we are talking about increasing human life expectancy to 100+ years like in Blue Zones. 
I have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Michael Gregor. They all are against consuming dairy products. Dr. Collin Campbell did concede that if the total protein in a diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay to consume as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows.

Why Dairy Is Unhealthy?
Numerous studies and expert opinions highlight dairy's potential health risks including its ineffectiveness in bone health, its link to cancer, and its contribution to various diseases and conditions. Widespread lactose intolerance further underscores dairy's unsuitability for many. Here are some specific examples:
(1) There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries in Africa which have the lowest rate of milk consumption also have the lowest rate of osteoporosis. Conversely, countries consuming the most milk have the  highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers. 
(2) Dairy consumption increases the body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks. 
(3) According to a 2006 study by Harvard researchers, conducted with 10,000 women aged 26-46, the women who consumed the most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy product consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer. 
(4) Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body. 
(5) Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body. 
(6) Milk and cheese can cause acne. 
(7) Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases. 
(8) Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome. 
(9) Dairy is a cause of autoimmune diseases like arthritis.
(10) Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant. 
(11) Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes. 
(12) Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation. 
(13) Other problems associated with dairy include allergies and sinus issues. 
(14) Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet. 

Calcium Myth
Contrary to popular belief, the calcium in dairy is not efficiently absorbed due to its unfavorable phosphorus to calcium ratio. In order to absorb calcium one needs a calcium product that is conducive to absorption. The presence of phosphorus binds calcium to make calcium phosphate and biphosphate and diphosphate and makes it unavailable for absorption. To absorb calcium it must be available without phosphorus and milk does not provide that. So, for the most part, the calcium in the milk is in nonabsorbable. This is the reason why milk does not help people with osteoporosis. It even hurts them. 
Giving calcium pills as supplement also doesn’t help people with osteoporosis. Calcium just goes through the body and is excreted. Even vitamin D supplementation does not help. 
One has to do something to the bones to get calcium inside the bones. All the trials of supplementing calcium with vitamin D have failed. 
Dr. Lustig of UCSF recommends giving calcium to phosphorus in ratio of 4:1 whereas in milk it is 1:2. 
To achieve satisfactory calcium absorption other forms of calcium are required like calcium chloride or citrate. 
Here are some additional comments that support PBWF doctors' view against dairy. 
* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and even headaches after giving up dairy. 
* Dr. Neil Bernard filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order. 
* The US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in its dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health was one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and had called them “utterly ridiculous”.
* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia. 

Conclusion
Despite its historical role in human nutrition, the evidence against dairy consumption's health benefits is compelling. Alternatives to dairy, including plant-based milks and yogurts, offer nutritious and safe options for those seeking to avoid dairy's pitfalls. Acknowledging both the scientific findings and the cultural practices surrounding dairy consumption can guide us towards healthier dietary choices.

[10/5/25, 6:27:28 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Myth: A CALORIE IS A CALORIE

The belief that all calories are equal is a widespread myth, even among the well-educated segments of our society. This notion is heavily promoted by the processed food industry to justify the increasing presence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. The argument posits that the source of calories—whether from protein, fat, carbohydrates, or whether the food is whole or refined, cooked or raw—is irrelevant. What matters, according to this myth, is the balance between calories consumed and expended, with any excess supposedly stored as fat in our bodies. 
This perspective simplifies the issue to a matter of energy balance: consume more than you expend, and you'll gain weight. Consequently, the narrative absolves processed foods of blame, placing the onus on individual discipline to "eat less and exercise more." It reduces dietary advice to avoiding gluttony and laziness, suggesting that any calorie can fit into a balanced diet.
However, Dr. Robert Lustig from UCSF—one of the few remaining independent medical schools in the U.S.—has extensively researched this topic. He points out and I quote “This is the biggest lie in the history of medicine." The food industry's vested interest in perpetuating this myth has misled many into believing it's an incontrovertible truth. For instance, the sugar industry once advertised that three teaspoons of sugar were less fattening than an apple, diverting criticism from sugar to other foods.



The Fallacy of Portion Control
The "A Calorie is a Calorie" mantra suggests that a daily deficit of 500 calories should lead to losing one pound per week. However, many people find their weight loss stalls after initial success, leading to frustration. This phenomenon occurs because the human body, intelligent and adaptable, reduces its metabolic rate when it senses a food shortage—a survival mechanism honed over millennia. Our basal metabolic rate can drop, conserving energy during periods of scarcity, similar to how some animals hibernate.

Not All Consumed Food is Absorbed
The first thing to understand is that it is not the calories consumed that matter, it is the calories absorbed that matter. How many calories get absorbed in the body is a function of many factors. Firstly the speed at which the digested food travels through the small intestine and secondly the absorption rate while this food is traveling through the small intestine. Both of these are a function of fiber content of the food. Plant based whole food (PBWF) is full of fiber and as a result it has high motility and travels through the small intestine, where most of the absorption takes place, quite fast. PBWF also has nutrients embedded inside fibers that take time to be extracted. As a result the PBWF gets absorbed only partially and the balance reaches the colon where it feeds the microbes which in turn make essential nutrients for the body. A good example of this is resistant starch present in beans.  When beans are consumed, a significant portion of calories don’t get absorbed in small intestines (hence the title resistant) and move on to colon where our microbes feed on them.  This is also called the second meal effect. 
Another good example is that of almonds. There are 165 calories in an ounce of almonds but when we eat them, only 135 get absorbed. Where do the other 30 calories go? The fiber in the almonds
Is both soluble and insoluble. The insoluble fiber forms a mesh like a fishnet and soluble fiber forms a gel which is filling the wholes in the net. Together they create a barrier in the upper part of small intestine which restricts the absorption of starch and glucose into liver. The liver therefore does not get overloaded and new fat is not formed from the fructose which in the absence of fiber does get formed in a process  called de novo lipogenesis (DNL)
DNL is a complex and highly regulated process in which carbohydrates from circulation are converted into fatty acids that are then used for synthesizing either triglycerides or other lipid molecules. DNL helps keep the sugar and insulin levels down. High insulin level is very harmful as it drives abnormal growth. It drives vascular muscle growth that leads to coronary artery disease. It also causes prostate growth. The 30 calories that did not get absorbed go to the colon where our microbes feed on them. 
As you can see from two examples above, the calories eaten are not necessarily calories absorbed. This explains why a calorie is not a calorie. 

Food Processing and Its Impact
The way food is processed before consumption also affects its health impact. The same 100 calories from sugarcane can vary greatly in their effect on health depending on whether they're consumed as fruit, juice, jaggery, or white sugar.

PBWF vs. Refined Food
Refined foods are devoid of fiber as a result they (1) move slower through small intestines taking longer to reach colon and (2) they get absorbed readily as the intestines don’t have to work as hard to extract nutrients from the mesh of fibers. This dual effect makes most of the calories get absorbed in small intestines only, leaving nothing or little for the microbes waiting in the colon. The microbes in colon, when regularly deprived of fibers and starch, start to feed on mucosal layers creating a breach exposing intact protein in food to colon lining made of tight junction epithelial cells. A leak through this layer causes various auto immune diseases. 

Circadian Rhythm
The timing of calorie consumption  also matters due to our body's circadian rhythms, affecting how food is processed at different times of the day. Recent (2017) Nobel Prize-winning research has shed light on these mechanisms, highlighting the importance of synchronizing. Dr. Satchin Panda’s research at the Salk Institute in SanDiego has shown that carbohydrates consumed during daytime are handled differently than during night. During daytime they are kept as readily available glucose in the blood and during night they are quickly converted into triglycerides and stored away as fat. 

Macronutrient as a Sources of Calories
The source of calories—whether from proteins, fats, or carbohydrates—significantly influences health outcomes. Calories from proteins, for example, affect the body differently than those from fats or carbohydrates. Even within a single macronutrient category like carbohydrates, the impact varies based on the type, such as starch, glucose, or fructose.

Calories From Carbohydrates 
Carbohydrates, which include starches, glucose, and fructose, are metabolized differently in the liver. Starches are converted into glucose by the liver and distributed throughout the body. Table sugar, comprises equally of glucose and fructose and they are processed differently by the liver. Glucose circulates in the blood, while fructose can be converted into glucose for energy or into fat for storage, depending on need which is judged by insulin levels. High insulin levels signifies the sufficiency of glucose in the blood and prompts the liver to convert fructose into fat, which can be stored in subcutaneous fat cells or, if the process is overwhelmed, lead to ectopic fat deposits. This can contribute to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), visceral fat accumulation, and insulin resistance, the main cause of type 2 diabetes.
So once again you can see that a calorie is not a calorie. Glucose calorie is kept as readily usable glucose but fructose calorie may be stored as fat. 

Calories from  Protein 
Human body is very efficient in recycling protein as a result the protein requirement by the body is rather minimal. So liver converts all extra protein into fat or carbohydrates by a process called deamination. Deamination is the opposite of amination and it is a type of post-translational modification (PTM) in which an amine group is removed from a protein. This process creates organic acids which provide energy (ATP) to cells. 
This process costs energy, in fact twice as much energy as what it takes to burn carbohydrates. So the net result is that protein provides less calories than carbohydrates, by some estimates as much as 30% less. This explains the popularity of keto diets but this extra burden on liver and kidneys leads to problems in those organs as we age. 

Calories from Fat
All fats are 9 calories per gram but it is wrong to think that all fats are equal. Omega-3 fats are very healthy fats but trans-fats are very unhealthy. Trans-fats cannot be broken down by our body cells into energy (ATP).
When we run out of glucose stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, the body can use fat to provide energy. Theoretically it is correct however in practice the body first sends hunger pangs as a signal to consume more sugar or starch (which provide glucose more readily) before digging into it’s reservoir of fat which is kept for rainy day when food may not be available. So this is another reason a calorie is not a calorie. 

Myth: Exercising Alone Will Take Care of My Health
One common myth many young people, who exercise regularly, have is that “Nothing wrong can happen to them because they physically work out regularly”. As a result they become lax in dietary discipline. The data shows that about half of the people, who die after their first heart attack, have no signs of cardiovascular disease. Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF points this out clearly in his book Metabolical suggesting that of the 8 mechanisms for a healthy body, exercise helps only 4. Food is most important for good health and must not be neglected. 

Conclusion
As you can see from explanations given above, it is not only what food you eat that matters, it is also what is done to the food and what your body’s metabolic response is to the food that matters. This underscores the principle that not all calories are equivalent, highlighting the importance of considering the source and type of macronutrients in dietary choices.

[10/5/25, 6:27:30 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •SUPPLEMENTS MYTH•

Growing up, our eating patterns are largely influenced by family habits, leading to a limited diet that may cause nutrient deficiencies. Unlike handling excess nutrients, our bodies struggle with deficiencies. Relying on inorganic or organic supplements to address these deficiencies can disrupt our body’s balance.

Food Supplements Industry
In the United States alone the food supplements industry boasts a revenue exceeding $160 billion and is expected to reach $265 billion by 2030. This industry thrives on confusion and doubt, funding studies to make you question your nutrient intake and promote supplement use.

Depletion of Soil
It is an acknowledged fact that today’s plant foods are not as nutrient-rich due to factors like river damming for hydropower, monoculture farming and inorganic fertilizers. These practices deplete essential trace minerals in the soil. When we use inorganic fertilizers, the focus is only on a few key nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium etcetera. This depletes the trace minerals in the soil and the food it produces. When we use compost made of human and animal waste these trace minerals are recycled back into soil. 
The arguments presented by the food supplements industry to point out nutrition depletion in modern plant produce are valid arguments. What is not valid is why should one take supplements instead of eating another carrot or apple to make up for mineral depletion. People are eating fewer fruits and vegetables compared to our grandparents generation. They actually should be eating more to make up for deficiency in nutrients. Eating refined and ultra processed foods further reduce the nutrients in our diet. Our diets are becoming calorie rich and nutrient poor. This is one of the reasons why organic food is richer in trace minerals (besides of course the absence of pesticides). This is also the reason why food grown in the wild, like wild berries, is much healthier. 

What About Not-Yet-Known (NYKnown) Nutrients?
A major problem with supplements is that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about. But there are likely to be many more nutrients in food which have not yet been discovered. So when we take supplements, it creates imbalances in the not-yet-known nutrients. 

Beta Carotene Study
To make my point I like to give the example of Beta Carotene, which is from a family of carotenoids. Beta Carotene was discovered almost two centuries ago and has since been believed to be an important nutrient, just like vitamin C, for heart health. Many cardiologists have been prescribing Beta Carotene supplementation for heart health. However a major study recently revealed that the groups of patients who received Beta Carotene supplementation were dying early compared to the groups that did not. This was quite perplexing and further analysis showed that there are actually 750 types of carotenoids and the human body needs about fifty of them. Our body cells have limited receptors to receive these carotenoids. When we supplement only one carotenoid like Beta Carotene, the receptors get flooded with this carotenoid, not leaving enough room to receive other 49 carotenoids. This created deficiency in these other carotenoids among those groups who received supplementation and led to earlier deaths. 

Symphony of Nutrients
Nutrients behave in complex ways with other nutrients. Reducing them to a single nutrient at a time and consuming does not replicate those processes. As elaborated by Dr Colin Campbell in the documentary “Forks over Knives”, all nutrients work in a synergism, like various instruments in a symphony. Often you don’t even hear the individual instruments, but the symphony is very pleasing and sounds beautiful. To isolate one instrument and enhance it can spoil the symphony. Each of our bodies is like a symphony played out with various nutrients. We know now, after the discovery of Epigenetics, that each one of us has a very different microbiome composition. So it is like each one of us has a body playing out our individual symphony. 
There are many other examples of nutrient imbalances. Here are few more: 
1. Taking Calcium supplements depletes Magnesium because Magnesium is required by the body to absorb Calcium.
2. Taking Zinc supplements reduces Copper absorbability and taking Copper supplement creates imbalance in Zinc. 
3. Presence of Phosphorus reduces calcium absorbability as in dairy milk.  

Impact on Liver & Kidney
After food is absorbed in the small intestines all supplements consumed first go to liver, which is the chemical factory in our body. The supplements get metabolized there and filtered through the kidneys. This increases the load on these vital organs, reducing their healthy lifespan. This impact is only noticeable once we reach an old age. 
How trace minerals and many micro nutrients affect our body is a science that is not fully understood yet, and lot more research has to be done. So the safest approach is to avoid all supplements. Vitamin B12 is the only exception because the municipal water supply that we consume is all chlorinated and kills the bacteria that produces vitamin B12. 

False Sense of Security 
Taking supplements can also create a false sense of security and makes us pay less attention to our diet. All nutrient deficiencies should be compensated by consuming balanced meals. We must add foods to our diet that we have been missing. My recommendation is to eat multiple varieties in each food group and specially green leafy vegetables, berries, flaxseeds and walnuts.

Reductionist Approach
As the science of nutrition evolved a century ago our focus was on understanding the roles of various nutrients in our body’s functioning. 
The human mind has limitations and it works better in understanding linear correlations. As a result we tended towards a reductionist approach to nutrition. The role of Vitamin C became clear based on research on sailors who were deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for extended periods and developed scurvy. The food industry was quick to provide solutions by isolating vitamins to make up for the deficiencies. Creating and propagating this reductionist and deficiency mindset serves the purpose of the Processed Food and Supplements industry well. Nutrition science has focused on these two approaches for the past century and, in spite of the wealth of academic knowledge on nutrition and chronic diseases, one does not see any dent in the growth of such diseases. It begs the question "Why is that so?" One explanation is that the field of nutrition has become more about marketing profitable products than educating people about the fundamentals of health and wellness. 

There is a tendency on many people’s part, who are health conscientious, to look for ways to supplement their diet with healthy supplements. How does one define healthy supplements? Some think plant-based supplements are healthy and others think Ayurvedic or homeopathic supplements are healthy. 

Typical Indian Meal Plan

A cursory analysis of a typical Indian diet plan shows that we Indians consume over half of our calories from refined and processed foods which are empty calories. Replacing these empty calories with nutrient rich calories from plant based whole foods can easily take care of any nutritional deficiencies and should be the way to go. 

American Gut Project
A recent study known as the American Gut project (2013-2018) which involved participants from 45 countries showed some interesting results. It concluded that people who consumed a wide variety of plant based foods (over 30 varieties each week) were much healthier than those who consumed few (less than 10 varieties each week). Their immunity from infections diseases was also the highest in the first group. It is for this reason, I recommend that we should try to consume at least seven varieties in each of the five food group each week. The five food groups being Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Beans & Legumes and Nuts & Seeds. Besides this, one should also eat as many spices as one can each week. 

Conclusion
Nutrition is about the synergy of a diverse diet, not just supplementing with isolated nutrients. Embrace variety, focus on whole foods, and question the necessity of supplements for a balanced and healthy lifestyle.

Dr. Colin Campbell, who is considered the top nutritionist in the world today, emphasizes that one must unlearn everything one has come to know about nutrients and only remember that:
“FOOD, NOT NUTRIENTS, IS THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT IN NUTRITION.”

[10/5/25, 6:27:31 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: BASICS OF PHYSIOLOGY

After exploring various myths about diet and lifestyle, we will now delve into the fundamentals of human physiology and nutrition. Every living organism, from single cells to primates, has two primary objectives: (1) survival and (2) propagation. For survival, two elements are crucial, which in Vedanta are termed PRANA and APANA. Prana represents the life-giving force, including food and air (oxygen) for energy, while Apana refers to the elimination of waste produced by metabolism, driven by Prana. In this and the next three blog posts, we will examine the four basic systems of human physiology:

1. Gastrointestinal Tract: It ingests and processes food.
2. Respiratory System: It inhales fresh air and exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide.
3. Blood Circulatory System: It distributes nutrients and oxygen to every cell in the body.
4. Lymphatic System: It acts like a janitorial system, removing waste from all body parts due to metabolic processes. 

GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT
This tract is the path from our mouth to the anus, through which food passes, is consumed, digested, absorbed, and eventually, waste is excreted.

As depicted in the pictures below, food enters our mouth where it is mixed with saliva and chewed into a fine slurry before moving through the esophagus to the stomach via a sphincter valve. In the stomach, food mixes with acids and digests over a period that can range from two to six hours. The total transit time of food, from ingestion to defecation, can vary from 10 to 72 hours, primarily depending on the type of food and gut health. Here's a breakdown:

- Gastric emptying: 2-6 hrs.
- Small Intestine transit: 2-6 hrs.
- Colonic transit: 6-60 hrs.
- Total Gut transit: 10 to 72 hrs.

This transit time largely depends on how nutrients are embedded within the food's fibers. Food lacking fiber moves slowly but is quickly absorbed. In contrast, plant-based whole foods move quickly due to the motility created by undigested fibers but are absorbed slowly, as extracting nutrients like sugars and starches from fibers takes time. This dynamic results in a significant challenge for animal and processed foods, as they are quickly and completely absorbed, leading to liver overload and potential weight gain, with little left for the colon's microbial inhabitants.

When this pattern repeats, our microbial guests become starved and agitated, starting to consume the mucosal layer they inhabit, eventually leading to inflammation and conditions like "Leaky Gut Syndrome" or "Irritable Bowel Disorder."

EPITHELIAL CELL LINING
The human gastrointestinal tract is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells with tight junctions, protected by an inner mucus layer containing goblet cells that produce mucus. Adjacent to this inner layer is an outer mucus layer, home to various microbes. 
The importance and roles of these colon microbes are becoming increasingly clear, giving rise to a new field called epigenetics. Surprisingly, our bodies host more foreign cells (38 trillion microbes) than our own cells (37 trillion). These microbes play a significant role in our health, overshadowing our genetic makeup. This was highlighted in the January 14, 2010, issue of TIME magazine.

"Microbiota" refers to the collective microbes (sometimes called a microbial garden), with "Microbiome" denoting their genetic makeup. These terms are often used interchangeably. An analogy to understand the human microbiome versus genome is comparing computer hardware and software: despite similar hardware, the software dictates the functionality, akin to how our epigenome, the body's software, influences gene expression. 
To make my point clear I like to give an example of cell phones. 
All cell phones in use today are very similar in terms of hardware however, how this hardware expresses itself visually on the screen or audibly on the speaker depends upon what software is being used. For example Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram all express very differently on the same phone. So our epigenome is our body’s software and it determines how our genes are expressing at any given moment. 

This understanding is revolutionizing medical science, leading to groundbreaking practices like fecal transplantation which was not even in the realm of our wildest imagination. An overweight woman, who has tried everything in her life to lose weight, loses weight simply upon receipt of a fecal transplantation from a slim woman. Some of the lessons we have learned with this new science suggest:
1. Same cause can manifest as different symptoms in different people. 
2. Same symptoms can be due to different causes in different people therefore diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science distraught with many hits and misses. 
4. A different diet for different diseases doesn’t make sense but a different diet for different individuals could make sense. It is conceivable that soon in future, we may create meal plans based on one’s fecal sample analysis. 

Refined vs. Whole Food
Consider the example of identical twins T1 and T2, consuming the same ingredients (wheat, peanuts, and apples) in different forms for breakfast. T1 opts for porridge in peanut milk with fresh apples, while T2 consumes refined flour kachori fried in peanut oil with apple juice. T1 maintains health, but T2 may gain weight and risk developing diabetes, liver, and kidney issues. This disparity arises because T1's body might leave some calories for the microbiome, keeping them happy and satisfied, whereas T2's body absorbs all calories in the small intestine, leaving nothing for microbial digestion. This causes microbes to consume the mucosal layer in which they reside. Over time, this can lead to leaky gut and autoimmune diseases. 
Sugar spikes due to Apple juice and refined flour would result in new fat formation in liver (de novo lipogenesis) causing non alcoholic fatty liver disease and visceral fat and insulin resistance (Diabetes type-2). Ultimately both the kidney and liver will be affected shortening his lifespan. 

The impact of diet on health is profound, yet often overlooked, with many attributing health issues to bad luck. However, chronic diseases are less about luck and more about the consequences of dietary choices, particularly the consumption of refined and highly processed foods.

Conclusion
The transition from whole foods to refined and processed options during the past century is a primary contributor to lifestyle-related diseases. These diseases affect our body on a daily basis in small ways that are rarely noticeable until it is often too late. They are not impervious as we often like to believe. Taking medications to suppress symptoms is not the solution. The diet has to be modified.

RESPIRATORY SYSTEM

Yesterday we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract, which provides the essential nutrients our bodies need to sustain themselves. These nutrients require oxygen to metabolize and produce energy. The respiratory system is crucial in delivering fresh oxygen to the body and expelling carbon dioxide. While the respiratory system is also involved in sound production and the sense of smell, our focus here will be on the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.

When we inhale through our nose or mouth, the air travels down the trachea into the lungs, where it divides into multiple branches called bronchioles, eventually reaching tiny sacs known as alveoli. The human lung contains over 600 million alveoli, with their combined surface area roughly equivalent to a tennis court.

Surrounding the alveoli are blood capillaries that carry blood from various body parts. This blood is rich in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs across the alveolar membrane and the capillary walls through diffusion. The picture below shows how an alveolar capillary exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen. 


Diminished Surface Area
At birth, the surfaces of the alveoli and capillaries are pristine, maximizing gas exchange efficiency. However, over time, two significant changes occur. First, dust and pollutant particles accumulate on the alveolar lining, reducing the area available for gas exchange. Second, the capillaries' inner linings develop plaque due to the consumption of inflammatory foods, further diminishing the available surface area. As we age, the reduction in surface area becomes more pronounced, leading to breathing difficulties, a condition known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).
It is important to understand that obstruction is happening on both sides of that one tennis court size surface of all 600 million plus alveoli of the lung. 
The obstruction on the capillary wall is due to atherosclerosis which is classified as a cardiovascular disease. 
The discomfort one experiences in breathing is due to the combination of these two phenomenons working together. 
Historically, main pollutants like dust and coal particles from wood and charcoal burning prompted people to seek cleaner air in sanatoriums as they aged.

Diminished Breathing Capacity
Breathing capacity is another crucial factor. The average lung holds about 6 liters of air, but only a fraction is used during normal breathing. This capacity, which varies among individuals and even within the same person over time, increases with physical activity. Enhancing respiratory capacity through active lifestyles can improve conditions like COPD, as physical activity can help revive some collapsed alveoli.

Symptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, wheezing, and a chronic cough. The cough is a mechanism by which body clears obstructions, but when these consist of fine particles, the condition becomes persistent. That is why it is called chronic. 

Nitric Oxide Gas to Rescue
Consuming green leafy vegetables and beetroots, which are high in nitrates, release nitric oxide in the blood vessels, aiding in the removal of atherosclerotic damage and improving gas exchange. These vegetables can be consumed as salad or green juice. Additionally, Pranayama breathing exercises like Bhastrika and Kapalbhati can help alleviate respiratory obstructions, offering benefits for those with respiratory conditions.

BLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM 

In our past two sessions, we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract and the Respiratory System, which provide the nutrients and oxygen necessary for survival. 
Once absorbed, these nutrients need to be transported to every part of the human body, a task accomplished by the blood circulatory system. 
This system is comprised of a heart that acts as a pump and approximately 70,000 miles of blood vessels, evenly split between arteries (which carry blood from the heart to all body parts) and veins (which return the blood to the heart). At the site where the blood is delivered, these vessels narrow into thin capillaries.

The blood vessels' internal lining consists of a single layer of endothelial cells. This network is so extensive that the total surface area of this lining equals about 6-8 tennis courts. Collectively, this surface is known as the endothelium, arguably the largest organ in the human body. When the heart pumps blood, it causes the blood vessels to expand slightly due to pressure, which then drops, causing the vessels to shrink. These fluctuations are known as systolic and diastolic blood pressures.

Nitric Oxide Gas
A unique feature of the endothelial lining is its ability to release nitric oxide (NO) gas, facilitating smooth blood flow. When blood vessels develop plaque, the effective opening narrows, increasing the friction and, consequently, the blood pressure needed to maintain blood flow.

Evolution Time Line
Our bodies have evolved over billions of years. In a hypothetical 500-page book about human evolution, the domestication of animals and the advent of agriculture would appear only in the last paragraph of the final page. I mention this to address common arguments advocating animal-based foods, despite the facts.

What is Inflammation?

Inflammation is the body's reaction to perceived threats, which may not always be genuine. For instance, consider everyday activities that pose no danger because they are familiar. When we rise early in the morning, there are numerous routines we follow that do not alarm us because they are habitual, and we recognize the individuals involved. For instance, a sweeper cleans the street, a newspaper delivery person brings the newspaper, and the regular housekeeper rings the doorbell, to which we respond by letting her in.
Imagine a scenario where the doorbell rings again, and through the peephole, you see a tall, unfamiliar figure. This might trigger a sense of alarm or perceived threat. You might whisper to your spouse to stay silent, pretending no one is home, in hopes the stranger will leave. Alternatively, if your spouse is a retired military officer, he might retrieve a firearm from a safe and loudly inquire who's at the door. There could be various responses to this situation. The individual outside may pose no actual threat and could be a new neighbor seeking directions to the university. Nonetheless, the critical point here is the perception of threat and the consequent reaction, which is analogous to inflammation. In this metaphor, the situation is inflammatory, prompting an 'inflamed' response, which represents inflammation.

Inflammatory Foods 
Consuming plant-based whole foods, which have been part of our diet for millions of years, does not alarm the body. However, introducing animal products, refined, or ultra-processed foods, which are relatively new to our diet, triggers an inflammatory response. Such foods can compromise the integrity of the endothelial lining, leading to the formation of plaques as a repair mechanism.

ATHEROSCLEROSIS 
This process is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis starts early, as soon as children transition from breast milk to solid foods. Continuous consumption of inflammatory foods promotes plaque buildup, narrowing blood vessels and leading to increased blood pressure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and likely worldwide.

Green Leafy Vegetables To The Rescue
Green leafy vegetables are very rich in nitrates. When we consume them as salads or green juice, they release nitric oxide in the blood, helping unclog the blood vessels. This effect has been demonstrated by Dr. Caldwell Esselystyn of the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Dean Ornish of UCSF, showing potential in reversing cardiovascular diseases and reducing dependency on medications.

One must understand that lifestyle diseases are not random phenomena and they do not develop all of a sudden. They exist on a continuum and the markers like BP are body’s way of compensating for them. Lowering the markers with medication whether Allopathic, Homeopathic, Unani or Ayurvedic is not the solution. One must address the cause which is almost always our diet and lifestyle.

[10/7/25, 6:43:11 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: (4) LYMPHATIC SYSTEM
So far we have discussed how nutrients, essential for life, are consumed and distributed throughout the body. With the help of these nutrients every cell performs its metabolic function and in the process creates waste. The gaseous waste carbon dioxide is removed by the respiratory system but other waste is excreted as sweat, urine and feces. The system that collects this waste and takes it to the organs that excrete it (kidney, colon and skin) is called the Lymphatic System. It consists of a large network of lymphatic vessels throughout the body which merge into lymph nodes, lymphoid organs, lymphoid tissues and lymph.

The lymphatic system is also part of the immune system. It keeps body fluid levels in balance and defends the body against infections. The way the lymphatic system functions is by removing fluids (other than blood) from body tissues and cleaning it and recycling it. 
Many of the lymph nodes reside in our underarms and where our legs join the body. Interestingly the lymphatic system does not have a pump and relies heavily on the body’s movement specially the hands and the legs. 
This is one reason why the regular movement of hands and legs is very important. The important function of walking is often neglected by most writers while criticizing the 10,000 steps recommendation. Ideally these steps should be spread throughout the day as much as possible. 

With this discussion, we've covered four critical systems of human physiology. Next week, we'll delve into the basics of nutrition.

[10/7/25, 6:43:12 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •BASICS OF NUTRITION•

Having discussed the basics of physiology, describing how nutrients are ingested and distributed throughout the body and waste is collected and excreted, we will now delve into the types of nutrients and their role in bodily functions. Nutrients are categorized into three groups:
1. Macronutrients: Provide energy.
2. Micronutrients: Provide essential nutrients without energy.
3. Other Nutrients

1.0 MACRO NUTRIENTS 
Macronutrients are energy-providing nutrients, measured in kilocalories but often referred to as calories. The three macronutrients are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.

1.1 Proteins
We previously discussed proteins in the context of nutrition myths. To recap, proteins, providing 4 calories per gram, are vital for every cell. They consist of chains of twenty different amino acids in various permutations and combinations. Out of these, nine are essential, meaning our body cannot synthesize them, so they must be ingested through food. A typical human body utilizes approximately 200 grams of protein daily, recycling about 85% of it, leaving a deficit of about 30 grams. The body lacks a storage system for proteins; excess intake is converted into fat and nitrogen in the liver. The fat is stored subcutaneously, while nitrogen is transformed into ammonia, then uric acid, and finally excreted as urine. Excessive protein intake can strain the liver and kidneys, shortening their productive life. This is the reason why dialysis is becoming so common among the baby boomer generation. 

1.2 Carbohydrates
Carbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, providing four calories per gram. They include starch, glucose, fructose, lactose, and glycerols. Starch is converted into glucose in the liver, which is then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream. The liver can convert fructose into glucose or fat, depending upon the need of the body. This key difference plays an important role in 
influencing metabolism significantly. 

1.3 Fats
Fats, offering nine calories per gram, are a dense energy source and the preferred storage form for excess calories. Fats are categorized by saturation level or chain length:
• Saturated Fats: Each carbon atom is bonded to hydrogen, predominantly found in animal products and considered unhealthy in excess.
• Monounsaturated Fats: Contain one double bond and are found in plant foods like nuts, seeds and avocados, beneficial for health.
• Polyunsaturated Fats: Contain multiple double bonds. These include essential omega-3 and omega-6 fats. Of the two, Omega-6 is found in plenty in nature but Omega-3 is scarcer so special attention needs to be paid. Our body needs both omega-3 and omega-6 in equal amounts. 
Many vegetable oils are too rich in omega-6 and have hardly any omega-3.  Any ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 higher than 3 is problematic and should be avoided. The richest plant based sources of Omega-3 are Flaxseeds, Chia seeds, Hempseeds, Mustard seeds and walnuts. Mustard which is found in abundance has an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 3:1 which is very healthy. That is why mustard seeds should be consumed regularly and mustard oil is the least harmful of all oils. 
• Trans Fats: When oils undergo hydrogenation, they transform into a solid form at room temperature. These hydrogenated oils are known as trans fats and are highly detrimental to health. They gained popularity at the turn of the 19th century when saturated animal fats were discouraged due to heart health concerns. Trans fats are commonly found in products like vegetable shortening and margarine. Owing to their adverse health effects many countries, including the U.S., have banned them. However, they are still permitted in India. Dalda, introduced in India about a century ago, is a prominent example of trans fats; in the U.S., Crisco is a well-known equivalent.

Fats can also be classified by the length of the fatty acid chains, which can be short, medium, long, or extra-long. When we consume whole plant-based foods fiber is digested by bacteria in the lining of our colon, producing short and medium-chain fatty acids that are beneficial to our health.

(2) MICRONUTRIENTS 
Micronutrients are crucial for health but they do not provide any energy. They include following:

2.1 Vitamins
Vitamins are essential organic compounds that the body requires in small amounts for nutrition. There is a variety of vitamins readily available in plant-based foods. However, two vitamins that warrant particular attention are B12 and D3. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria found in soil, which can enter our bodies through groundwater or direct contact with the soil, such as when farming barehanded and barefoot. In modern times, we often avoid direct contact with soil, and our water, sourced from municipal tanks, is chlorinated, killing all bacteria. Consequently, B12 deficiency is quite common among vegans. Although B12 is present in green water plants, commonly known as seaweeds, which make a regular part of diets in Japan, Korea and China, they are not consumed in India and the rest of the world. These seaweeds can also be good sources of vitamin D3 and Iodine. 

2.2 Minerals 
Minerals are found in air, water, and soil and plants absorb them effectively. These minerals enter our bodies through plant-based foods. However, the use of inorganic fertilizers and practices like monoculture farming can deplete the soil of these vital nutrients and seeds leading to deficiencies in our diet. To counteract this, it is crucial to consume organically grown produce and utilize rock salts, which are abundant in trace minerals. Among these, iodine deserves special attention. It is advisable to incorporate iodine-enriched salts into your diet to ensure adequate intake.

2.3 Antioxidants
When various metabolic reactions occur in our body, they often release a single atom of oxygen. These oxygen atoms are highly reactive and can cause oxidation of other molecules nearby, leading to a phenomenon known as oxidative stress. Certain chemical compounds, known as antioxidants, are effective in neutralizing these single oxygen atoms. Many plant foods are abundant in antioxidants and consuming them can help reduce oxidative stress. While all fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, berries, leafy greens, herbs, and spices are particularly rich sources and should be included in one's daily diet.

2.4 Phytonutrients
Phytonutrients are phytochemical compounds produced by plants to protect themselves against attacks from fungi, bacteria and plant viruses, as well as from insects and other small animals. In large concentrations, some of these compounds can also be poisonous. Approximately 10,000 different phytochemicals have been identified, but discussing them all is beyond the scope of this blog. However, I would like to highlight two of them: carotenoids and polyphenols. The most well-known carotenoid is beta-carotene, discovered nearly two centuries ago and linked to eye and heart health. It is found in carrots, hence the name carotene. Today, we understand that there are 750 different carotenoids, and the human body requires about 50 of them. Supplementing with beta-carotene was a common practice until recently, but it can lead to imbalances in the absorption of other carotenoids and should therefore be avoided.

Polyphenols are phytonutrients that help protect body tissues against oxidative stress and associated pathologies, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, and inflammation.

(3) WATER
Water is an essential nutrient and must be consumed regularly. The human body does produce some water when it burns fat, but not enough to sustain itself. It is challenging to survive beyond a week or two without water. I recommend consuming two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, even before brushing your teeth. This practice is beneficial because our body produces saliva overnight, which is good for our health. We should swallow this saliva with water. Additionally, one should drink a glass of water an hour after every meal and another glass before going to bed. Except for the water consumed in the morning and at night, which should be drunk as is, it is a good habit to obtain most of your water intake from eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are primarily water anyway. Hence the saying "eat your water."

(4) FIBER
Fiber is an essential nutrient that is often misunderstood and neglected. Here are some key benefits of fiber:
- Fiber aids in the motility of our intestines.
- It slows down nutrient absorption in our small intestines, allowing certain foods, such as resistant starch, to reach the colon where they serve as nourishment for bacteria.
- Fiber moderates the absorption of sugar in our liver, preventing its overload. An overloaded liver can lead to several issues, including (1) fatty liver, potentially progressing to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, (2) the accumulation of visceral fat, and (3) the formation of intramyocellular lipid, which can cause insulin resistance, leading to Type 2 diabetes.
- Fiber supports the beneficial bacteria in our gut, helping them produce short- and medium-chain fatty acids, which are vital for our health.

Conclusion 
All nutrients play a crucial role in our health, functioning in a complementary manner akin to a symphony performed by an orchestra. We should obtain these nutrients from plant-based foods, which are their primary sources. It is advisable to avoid secondary sources and supplements.

[10/8/25, 6:54:25 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: FIVE PILLARS OF HEALTH

We have so far delved into numerous diet and lifestyle myths that often lead us astray. We've also touched on the essentials of human physiology and nutrition. Today, we embark on a series about what I term the "five pillars of health," key components that bolster our well-being and aid in preventing and reversing many lifestyle-related diseases.
The advent of the light bulb and the discovery of antibiotics a century ago marked a societal shift, leading us to normalize disease as an inevitable aspect of aging. The light bulb disrupted our circadian rhythms, spawning numerous chronic health issues, while the triumph of penicillin over infectious diseases fostered a belief that a pill could be the panacea for all ailments. 
Post-World War II affluence ushered in an era of lifestyle diseases like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. When pills fell short, the medical and pharmaceutical sectors proposed a new narrative: chronic diseases were incurable, pinned on overindulgence and inactivity. Their solution was to manage these conditions by keeping their markers in check with ongoing medication and check-ups. 
Meanwhile, the rise of the processed food industry post-WWII, driven by shareholder profits, led to less nutritious, irresistible food options, contributing to a surge in health issues. This convergence of interests among the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, overlooked by government and media, has escalated chronic diseases to unprecedented levels, quietly normalizing this unhealthy status quo to a point where we have more sick people than healthy people in the civilized world. 

Acknowledging that diet and lifestyle are at the core of many chronic conditions begs the question: Why not change them? 
The human body has an innate ability to heal, but relying on medications to mask symptoms interrupts this process, often leading to a cascade of further health complications. The spiral of illness thus created continues untill death. 
Studies of centenarians in "Blue Zones" debunk the myth that chronic diseases are a given in old age. These populations live well into their 90s and beyond, largely disease-free. 
There is overpowering evidence that suggests that there are five pillars of health which contribute to prevention and reversal of most chronic diseases if not all.

(1) Food
Our 37 trillion cells require nourishment, which is compromised by modern food processing techniques. Removing fiber and adding harmful ingredients which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) disrupt our satiety signals and contribute to chronic illnesses. 
Notably, research indicates that a diet with more than 8% protein, particularly from animal sources, can promote cancer. Key dietary rules include avoiding animal products, refined foods, and ultra-processed items.

(2) Detoxification 
The food consumed is metabolized by cells throughout the body, producing waste that needs to be collected and excreted. The lymphatic system, nearly as extensive as the circulatory system, facilitates this process. The human brain can only eliminate metabolic waste during the deep sleep cycle at night. In addition to metabolic waste, our bodies also accumulate dead and damaged cells that can harm adjacent healthy cells. The Nobel Prize-winning research from 2016 demonstrated that fasting for over 22 hours induces a process called autophagy, where the body recycles such waste. Thus, it is highly recommended to fast every two weeks, aligning with the Indian tradition of Ekadashi fasts. Furthermore, another Nobel Prize-winning study in 2018 showed that prolonged fasting for 10 days, with only a small, especially low-protein meal each day, enhances immunity against serious diseases like cancer. This practice is strikingly similar to the Indian Navratri fasting tradition. Other yoga practices, such as Shatkarma, are also beneficial for detoxifying the body.

(3) Circadian Rhythm
All species of plants and animals on Earth have evolved within a 24-hour day-night cycle and are well adapted to this rhythm. Many glands in our body release hormones in sync with these cycles, regulating various bodily functions. However, with the advent of electricity, our lifestyles have shifted away from the natural day-night rhythm, disrupting our body's synchronization with nature's clock. Notably, the 2017 Nobel Prize was awarded for research demonstrating how our body's master clock aligns with the day-night cycle. Dr. Satchin Panda's work at UC San Diego and the Salk Institute over the past decade has shed light on this topic. For optimal health, consider the following recommendations:
Sun Gazing: Rise before sunrise and, within half an hour of sunrise and sunset, gaze around the sun, moving your eyes in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. Avoid direct sun gazing. 
Eating Patterns: Refrain from eating for at least an hour after sunrise and aim to finish dinner before sunset, or at least before it gets dark outside. 
Physical Activity: Avoid strenuous workouts when it's dark outside. 
Screen Time: Minimize exposure to blue light-emitting screens, such as TVs, computer monitors, and cell phones at night, or use a blue light filter on these devices. 
Sleep: Aim for a minimum of 8 hours of sleep per night. Avoid using an alarm to wake up, and compensate for any sleep deficit within the same week.

(4) Physical Activity 
The human body has evolved to accommodate a physically active lifestyle. The lymphatic system, which serves as our body's janitorial service, collects metabolic waste. However, unlike the blood circulatory system, it lacks a pump and depends on bodily movement to operate effectively. Therefore, it's essential to move regularly throughout the day. It is advised to engage in movement for 5 minutes every hour while awake. One method to monitor this is by counting your steps, aiming to reach at least 10,000 steps daily.

(5)  Emotional & Spiritual Health
Human emotions trigger the release of hormones that benefit not only our emotional well-being but also our physical health. We commonly hear that laughter is the best medicine because it helps alleviate stress. Similarly, giving unconditional love and surrounding oneself with recipients of such love, like young children and pets, significantly impacts our health. Additionally, prayers filled with gratitude saturate our bodies with hormones that promote happiness and contentment. The act of praying is crucial, regardless of the deity or entity being addressed. 
These five pillars of health, when consistently practiced and integrated into one's lifestyle, can help reverse many chronic diseases, if not all, and extend one's lifespan. This is similar to the patterns observed in various Blue Zones around the world, where people live over 100 years without diseases. Over next few weeks we will focus on these five pillars of health one at a time.

[10/8/25, 6:54:26 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •First Pillar of Health•
              FOOD. 

The most important of the five pillars of health is food. However, it's not just about what we eat; it also matters when we eat, how we eat, and what we do to our food before eating. My experience with 200,000 members has shown that a plant-based whole-food (PBWF) diet is optimal for humans. As we discuss the diet and lifestyle changes needed to treat chronic diseases, we must prioritize the bigger picture. Our goal is to significantly improve one’s health from its current state and to ideally eliminate the need for medications related to lifestyle diseases. My focus is on providing instructions that are simple and easy to remember. Here are my dietary recommendations:

(1) Avoid Animal Foods
No meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or dairy-based products such as yogurt, cheese, and ghee. Here are the reasons for this recommendation:
   - Animal foods are rich in protein. As discussed in my earlier blog (February 11), excess protein must be converted into fat and nitrogen by the liver, then into ammonia and uric acid, causing the liver and kidneys to work harder, potentially leading to the need for dialysis and transplants in later years.
   - Animal protein includes IGF-1, a hormone that promotes rapid cell growth. For example, a newborn calf weighing 50 pounds can grow tenfold to become a 500-pound bull. While human cells cannot grow that fast due to genetic modulation, cancer cells can thrive in the presence of IGF-1.
A metaphor I use is that while a lawn fed with potent fertilizer cannot grow faster, the weeds within it can. Similarly, tiny cancer cells in our body, common in most civilized populations, can grow rapidly due to IGF-1, thereby promoting cancer. 
   - Animal foods lack fiber, which is essential for feeding the microbes in our colon, potentially leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.
   - Animal foods are inflammatory and can cause atherosclerosis in our blood vessels, leading to various heart diseases.
   - The fat in animal food is mostly saturated fat, which is detrimental to cardiac health.

(2) Avoid Refined Foods
   - Refined foods such as oils, sugar, and white flour are devoid of fiber, moving slowly through the intestines, leading to full absorption of macronutrients and leaving little for the microbes residing in the colon. This can cause the microbes to consume the mucosal layer that protects the internal lining of the colon, leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.
   - Refined foods are quickly absorbed, overburdening our liver. This can lead to the formation of unwanted fat in the liver (causing fatty liver and NAFLD), visceral organs (visceral fat), and between muscle cells (intramyocellular lipids). Intramyocellular lipids block insulin receptors in our muscle cells, causing insulin resistance, a precursor to type-2 diabetes.

(3) Avoid Ultra Processed Foods 
Ultra-processed foods, like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), used as a sweetener in many processed foods, are devoid of fiber and contribute to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, they contain many chemicals labeled as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), yet they are not truly safe and cause numerous health issues. For instance, hydrogenated vegetable shortenings sold as margarine, and other products like Dalda and Crisco, have been found to be harmful and banned in many countries.

(4)  Eat from all five food groups
The five food groups are fruits, vegetables, beans & legumes, grains, and nuts & seeds. Regular consumption of herbs & spices is also highly recommended. Aim to consume one-fifth of your daily caloric intake from each food group, though this can vary daily. To accelerate weight loss, consume only the minimum recommended amount from the Nuts & Seeds group. Aim to eat at least 1% of your body weight in fruits (including berries) and vegetables (half from green leafy vegetables) daily.

(5) Five Nutrients Require  Special Attention 

 Monitor these key nutrients closely: Omega-3, vitamins D-3, B-12, and K-2, and iodine. To ensure adequate Omega-3 intake, consume one tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia seeds, along with a few walnuts each day. Include a variety of seeds and nuts; try to eat one Brazil nut each week as it is rich in selenium and also include pumpkin seeds. Take a vitamin B-12 supplement—either 50-100 mcg daily or 2,000 mcg weekly. Vitamin D-3 is best obtained from sun exposure. Only take a D-3 supplement if you are deficient and do not get much sun exposure. For vitamin K2 consume some fermented foods and also sauerkraut. It also helps to consume some sea greens like seaweed and algae as they are rich in iodine, Omega-3 and can provide some vitamin D and B12. Some examples are wakame salad, nori and kelp flakes.

(6) Keep Your Body Hydrated 
Drink a minimum of half a liter of warm water first thing in the morning before brushing your teeth, a glass an hour after dinner, and another glass before going to bed. Rest of the day, "eat" your water by consuming fresh fruits and vegetables rich in water content.

The first six of my Daily Dozen recommendations for diet and lifestyle include:

No other restrictions are there. Enjoy a variety of foods, including those you like and some you may not. Eat as much as you like but never beyond the point of liking. No portion control is necessary. After a year on the PBWF/IF/10K program (PBWF diet with 16:8 Intermittent Fasting and 10,000 steps daily), you should be able to rely on your body’s instincts to choose food and portion sizes.
Another rule of thumb is that at least half of your caloric intake should come from uncooked foods. Following these guidelines should naturally lead to this balance. Consider including sprouted beans to increase your intake of raw foods.

How To Cook Without Oil?
Many Indians feel at a loss because they aren't sure how to cook vegetables without using ghee or oil. Here are a few tips:
1. Sauté onions in a few tablespoons of water or vegetable stock.
2. Use spices that have been dry-roasted separately.
3. Incorporate nut butters like peanut or cashew butter.
4. Continue with your normal cooking process.
5. Use air fryers instead of deep frying, or opt for baking.
6. Add avocados to dough for making rotis or stuffed parathas. Avocados contain 80% fat.

Please note that in my recommendations, you are permitted to use nut or seed butters (pastes). This ensures that all dishes, including Pulao and Khichri, turn out perfectly. The only exceptions are deep-fried dishes, but you can use air fryers for those.

[10/8/25, 6:54:28 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Pillar-1 Food: Meal Plans

Many people request daily meal plans due to confusion about what to eat. As outlined in my guidelines from last week, our diet program offers complete freedom in choosing foods, provided they are plant-based whole foods (PBWF) and consumed within a narrow daytime eating window of 8-10 hours. Starting your day with green juice, fruits, nuts, and seeds for breakfast covers three of the five essential food groups, giving you flexibility for lunch and dinner. Here are some guidelines for a daily PBWF meal plan, assuming your eating window is from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Adjustments can be made for different eating windows.

BREAKFAST
10:00 AM: A glass of green juice
10:20 AM: A large bowl of fresh fruits and berries
 10:30 AM: Oatmeal or porridge made with nut milk and dates as a sweetener. Idli, Poha, Upma or similar PBWF items. This meal can also be combined with lunch, the choice is yours.

LUNCH
12:40 PM: A glass of green juice 
1:00 PM: Choose any PBWF dish made with grains, beans, legumes, or starchy vegetables. Examples include Daal/Roti, Daal/Rice, Khichri, Peas Pulao, Bisibhili Bhat, Idli, Dosa, Uttapam, Upma etc.

SNACK (Optional)
4:00 PM: Tea or coffee and/or fruits and/or dry fruits

DINNER
5:10 PM: A glass of green juice or  salad. 
5:30 to 6:00 PM: Any PBWF dish of your choice.

Note: The third glass of juice can be eliminated once you are off all medications, and the second glass can also be stopped after a year of no medications. Ensure you meet your daily intake of one tablespoon of Flax/Chia seeds and a few walnuts, although those watching their weight may limit this amount. Also, take a Vitamin B-12 supplement, with any meal. Remember, there is total flexibility with the meal menu.Any grains, beans, legumes, and starchy vegetables are acceptable.
You can make anything out of dosa batter; it takes care of two food groups: 
Daal
Rice
In the long run your body will guide you, by making you feel like eating one thing or the other. After 12 months on PBWF diet, you cannot go wrong, if you listen to your body. 
It would not be possible today,because there might be some unhealthy habits that need to be overcome first. It is a good idea to include a salad in your meal or have a salad as a meal.

[10/8/25, 7:13:03 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Every body has to find their own taste buds. Do not eat something because it is socially the in thing. For example I have watched the younger hip crowds paying a lot of money for extra virgin olive oil and boasting about it. Why can’t you just have olives. Olives are healthy, olive oil is not. 

Few Additional Comments
Stop looking for vegan alternatives to foods like fake meat hamburgers etc. Please remember your goal is to avoid processed foods also. Processed, prepackaged foods are full of additive which are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) but truly aren’t. 
Learn to make various chutney’s, and keep them ready in your refrigerator. They can add taste to any otherwise bland food. Tamarind chutney (Sonth) makes any food finger licking good. I find making chaats very easy for a quick meal and chaats have zero oil. 
It is important to note that oil free food doesn’t mean spice free. Spices are rich in antioxidants and must be consumed with every meal. This plan ensures that you can enjoy a healthy, varied diet while adhering to PBWF principles, providing flexibility and promoting long-term health benefits.

[10/9/25, 7:38:23 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• GREEN JUICING •••

Based on my experience in various health groups, I'd like to share four key insights:
1. Ease of Adoption: 
Some health advice is easier said than done. For example, consuming green leafy vegetables without using oil or ghee is challenging in Indian cuisine, where saag is a common preparation requiring these fats.
2. Dietary Changes: 
It is often hard to give up our favorite foods even when we know they are unhealthy. However, introducing tasty, healthy options can naturally displace less healthy choices.
3. Impact of Changes:
Gradual changes often yield less noticeable improvements which can lead to a loss of confidence. Making a few dramatic changes can keep these efforts top of mind and encourage persistence.
4.Ripple Effects:
A single conscious change can lead to multiple subconscious improvements and accrue significant benefits. For example, starting a daily walking routine led me to naturally reject calorie-dense snacks like cookies and donuts, mindful of the effort I'd put into walking.

Why Green Juice?
Green leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which help release Nitric Oxide in the bloodstream, unclogging blood vessels and reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues.
When I discussed dietary guidelines I mentioned that we need to consume a minimum 1% of our body weight in vegetables and half of that should be in green leafy vegetables. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn suggests six daily servings of green leafy vegetables for heart patients, including notable individuals like Bill Clinton. Given the culinary habits in India where salads are uncommon, I recommend juicing as a practical alternative, although it's second to consuming greens raw or blanched.
I recommend watching the documentaries “Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead" available on Netflix, and "Super Juice Me" on YouTube. These showcase dramatic health transformations through extended juice fasts. Inspired by these, I started with a five-day juice fast 11 years ago that transformed my life.
One should start with a 3-5 day juice fast, consuming 8-12 ounces of juice four to five times a day. After that continue with three glasses daily 15-20 minutes before meals to maximize health benefits until you can reduce or eliminate chronic medications.
The main goal here is to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetables (fruits should be eaten as a whole or to just make vegetable juice tastier). Juicing makes it easy. 

Selecting A Juicer
As green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed, especially for people who are on medications or want to lose weight. 
Consider hydraulic, double helical screw, and single augur juicers based on your budget and needs. Avoid high-speed centrifugal juicers as they can degrade nutrients and are less effective with leafy greens.
For patients who are critically ill, it is advisable to consume juice with minimum pulp. It is light on their stomach and for the same amount of fullness, they can consume more nutrients. (Not sure you need the last line re: cancer here since you mention critically ill above). 

Do You Lose Fiber?
A question often asked is “aren’t you removing fiber in juicing?”
The answer is that there are two types of fiber- soluble and insoluble. Juicing retains soluble fiber and some of the insoluble fiber as well. One should eat fruits as a whole and juice only vegetables. You can add some fruit to enhance the taste and yes Granny Smith apples because they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables. 
There is a saying: First thing in the morning, if you poop before you finish peeing; you are in good health. You soon will experience that.

Green Juice Recipe
Before diving into the recipe, it's important to note that there isn't a strict chemical composition required for making juice. Unlike the precise formulations often found in Ayurveda, the primary aim of juicing is to enjoy consuming green leafy vegetables in a tasty beverage, rather than enduring a bitter concoction solely for health benefits. Since everyone's taste preferences vary, feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your liking. The goal is to create a juice that's so delicious, your guests will ask for a second glass. 

Consider the recipe as consisting of three main groups of vegetables, along with some seeds:
1. Apples and Spice Group: This includes four Granny Smith apples (or any other suitable juicing apples), two lemons, and two thumb-sized pieces of ginger.
2. Hydration Group: Comprising one bunch of celery, one large English cucumber (or two medium regular cucumbers), and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the juice's water content, and you can easily double these ingredients if desired.
3.Leafy Greens Group: Choose any combination of one to three of the following: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beetroot greens, cabbage, etc. (2-3 bunches total). Alternatively, for a variation, replace this group with carrots and beetroots.

Enhance your juice by adding some flax seeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds. These seeds not only fulfill part of your Omega-3 needs but also provide fats that aid in nutrient absorption. Don't hesitate to include other non-starchy vegetables like bottle gourd, butter melon, raw turmeric, and mint. There are no restrictions—let your taste buds guide you!

Here is a typical green juice mixture in my kitchen. See in the picture from left to right:
Chard, Kale, Arugula, Bottle Gourd, Romaine lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Beetroot, Raw Turmeric root, Green apple, Carrot and Fenel. 

Shelf Life
Juice can be stored safely in airtight glass bottles in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours or frozen for longer storage, leaving space for expansion.

Organic vs Nonorganic
Always thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables. Seek organic sources if possible, but don't avoid conventional produce out of fear of pesticides; the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh the potential risks.
I recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market near you. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will remember you and always tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided. 

JUICE vs SMOOTHY 
This is one of the most frequently asked questions and there clearly is big confusion on this subject, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this. Before proceeding I want to make it clear that eating leafy greens raw as salad or blanched is the best option. The chewing action in the mouth mixed with saliva provides the most nutrition and absorption. Fruits ofcourse shoul always be eaten as whole fruits except some green apples (Granny Smith variety in US as they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables) which should be added to green juice. So the question is only, what is the second best option. 
1. Smoothies require high speed blending, this makes the air oxidize the nutrients. So you have some nutrient loss due to oxidization.
2. Because you have to mix a cup of water to start the process and because the pulp is retained, there are only half as many nutrients in a glass of smoothie as opposed to a glass of juice. 
3. Because of air and insoluble fiber you can not consume much smoothie and make up for reduced nutrients by drinking more. On the contrary the juice feels less filling than smoothie. 
4. A good juicer retains most of the soluble fiber in juice. Some of the insoluble fiber is also retained in small particles that go through the screen. The remaining insoluble fiber which is rejected, has little nutrient left. It is also not needed for bowl movement because one gets more than enough from juice. 
5. Juice does not stay in stomach much and passes through to small intestine quickly. Smoothies need to be digested and remain much longer in the stomach. Smoothies are not a good choice for juice fasts. 
6. Juice has a much longer refrigeration shelf life. You can juice only twice a week and store it in airtight glass bottles. It can also be frozen so one can reduce juice making to even once a week. 

This post clarifies green juicing, its benefits, and its practical implementation, aiming to promote better health practices and dietary adjustments.

[10/9/25, 7:38:26 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD YOU REALLY DRINK?

Social media is awash with adviceeon water consumption—recommending specific amounts to drink daily, detailing when and how to drink it, and even touting it as a cure for numerous ailments. My aim with this blog is to address these topics and clarify the confusion created by such claims.
The renowned Mayo Clinic suggests a daily water intake of 2.7 liters for women and 3.7 liters for men. While it's true that dehydration can lead to health issues, many of the claims about water curing illnesses are exaggerated and lack evidence. I recently spoke with a cancer patient who had increased his water intake to 3 liters per day in hopes of healing. While this hope is not harmful as long as he continues with necessary treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and avoiding angiogenic foods, it's important to set realistic expectations.
Water is crucial for maintaining various balances within the body, such as pH and mineral levels. Consider a New Yorker who subsists on a diet rich in meat, potatoes, coffee, and alcohol, with little to no water consumption; they might experience health issues that could be somewhat alleviated by drinking more water. However, this doesn't imply that increasing water intake can cure all individuals suffering from similar ailments. This is a common misconception promoted by many online videos and claims.
By understanding the true benefits and limitations of water consumption, we can approach our health more effectively and avoid falling for unfounded claims.

Benefits of Drinking Water
- Improves blood volume and viscosity
- Boosts your energy level
- Flushes out toxins and keeps your organs healthier
- Improves skin
- Promotes weight loss
- Enhances muscle contraction
- Improves hormone production
- Reduces joint pain
- Reduces stress hormones

The amount of water you need depends on several factors including your health, activity level, climate, and importantly, your diet—a factor often overlooked in mainstream media. 
Water aids in maintaining both alkalinity and sodium levels, suggesting that a diet high in alkaline foods and low in sodium (typically unprocessed) may reduce the need for excessive water to eliminate acidity or salt.
In a climate with temperatures ranging from 15-25 degrees Celsius and dry air (such as an air-conditioned environment), and assuming an activity level of 10,000 steps per day, a useful guideline is to drink 3-5% of your body weight in water. For instance, a person weighing 75 kilograms should consume 2.25-3.75 liters of water daily, equivalent to 9-15 glasses, assuming each glass holds 250 ml. If you're consuming 1% of your body weight in fresh fruits and 1% in vegetables daily (which are about 85% water), this accounts for approximately 1.7% of the 3-5% hydration needs. Thus, the remaining requirement is reduced to 1.3-3.3%, or 4-10 glasses of water daily.
For those avoiding non-vegetarian and processed foods, I suggest that 6 glasses per day may suffice. Consider drinking two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, one glass an hour after each meal, and one glass before going to bed. In hotter climates, like in India, it's advisable to drink a glass of water every time you come back from an outdoor trip. However, it's possible to drink too much water, which can lead to a loss of mineral balance. A practical way to assess your hydration level is by checking the color of your urine, which should ideally be at level 2 on a scale from 1 (clear) to 5 (dark yellow).
Note that acidic beverages and some types of acidic bottled water do not contribute to your total daily water intake.

Water with Meals or Not ?
Is it beneficial to drink water with meals? Opinions vary. Some sources recommend drinking warm or room-temperature water during meals to aid digestion, similar to the custom of drinking lukewarm green tea in Chinese and Japanese cultures. Others suggest waiting 45 minutes to an hour after eating before drinking water, claiming that it dilutes stomach acids and impairs digestion—though this lacks substantial scientific backing. The Mayo Clinic states that drinking water does not interfere with digestion.
An often overlooked factor in this debate is the type of food being consumed. For meals consisting of solid foods with low moisture content, drinking water or tea is advisable to aid in digestion. Many baked goods, such as bagels, muffins, cookies, or sweet potatoes, are difficult to swallow without the aid of a liquid. Similarly, most baked animal foods, unlike moisture-rich Indian curries, are low in moisture and may require water with meals. 
For those adhering to a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, which includes a substantial amount of fruits and vegetables and retains water and gravy in cooked items, there is less need to drink water during meals. However, I recommend taking one sip of water before starting to eat and a couple of sips at the end of the meal to aid in the functioning of the esophageal sphincter muscles and to facilitate oral hygiene. This aligns with the Hindu practice of taking a little water in your palm and circling it around your plate and swallowing it as a prayer before eating, and rinsing the mouth after meals. If it's not always feasible to spit the water out, swallowing it is perfectly acceptable, as it contains only the consumed food.
Water can be consumed during the meal if necessary, but it is advisable to drink it before starting and waiting about 45 minutes to an hour after finishing the meal.

Tulsi, Moringa or What?
A common question I encounter is about the practice of consuming various substances with morning water or on an empty stomach. It's crucial to understand that every plant food offers some benefits, but it's misleading to consider them in isolation. In India, it's widespread practice to add certain items as "superfoods," to your morning water. 
Most plant foods contain vitamins and minerals, their presence alone, as highlighted on social media, does not necessarily make them superior. Additionally, there's a practical issue with the advice to consume something on an empty stomach: how do you decide which should go first?
Once you have consumed one item, your stomach isn’t empty any more. 
I'm not opposed to consuming these items, but I advise treating them as part of your regular diet, not as supplements, and especially not outside your normal eating window. Believing they can compensate for deficiencies in your diet or lifestyle is a mistake. Here are some examples I often see: Lemon, Apple cider vinegar, Tulsi, Methi seeds, Moringa, Jeera, Ginger, Garlic, Aamla, Turmeric, Cinnamon, Curry leaves. The list goes on and on. 
My recommendation is to incorporate these into your recipes rather than consuming them as supplements, whether first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Consume them during your designated eating times, not during fasting periods.

Tea, Coffee or Chocolate ?
On the topic of tea, it's interesting to note that the British introduced tea to India around 180 years ago during their trade conflicts with China. While tea does contain some nutrients, the benefits are often offset when milk and sugar are added. A healthier alternative would be herbal teas, such as hibiscus, ginger, lemon, or cinnamon, which provide more nutrients without the need for additives like milk and sugar. 

Coffee, similarly, is not native to India. It was first introduced to the Karnataka hills in the 1670s. The issue with beverages like tea, coffee, and chocolate lies in the caffeine content, which is addictive—similar to other substances like tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, and opium. Addiction can dominate your life, dictating your actions and even basic functions like using the bathroom. Skipping your usual dose can lead to headaches and a general inability to function. Thus, I recommend trying to break free from this dependency. Some people may succeed in quitting cold turkey while others might prefer a gradual approach.

From a health perspective, all three beverages contain nutrients that are beneficial, but not when consumed in the typical way with added milk and sugar, which offset these benefits. If you choose to consume them, it's best to do so without these additions and in moderation. Consider starting by eliminating milk and sugar from your beverages. Opt for black tea with lemon or cardamom, or try Kashmiri Kahwa, which contains neither sugar nor milk. Green tea is another excellent option.

You might also notice that biscuits or donuts often accompany tea or coffee with milk. Eliminating milk from your tea or coffee can make it easier to stop consuming these snacks as well. I personally quit drinking tea ten years ago. For first few years I missed the routine of having a cup of hot beverage in the morning now even the idea doesn’t cross my mind. Please watch the linked video below.

[10/10/25, 7:24:35 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • GLUTEN, SOY & SALT•

Is Gluten it Unhealthy?
The belief that gluten is unhealthy has been debunked by numerous plant-based whole food (PBWF) doctors. This myth, along with
the misconception that carbohydrates are detrimental to health and contribute to diabetes, has persisted in various forms for decades. The media, including bestsellers like *Wheat Belly* and *Grain Brain*, and articles in Indian media predicting the obsolescence of chapatis, have fueled this narrative. However, one might wonder why wheat, a staple for over 10,000 years, has suddenly been deemed unhealthy.
Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder triggered by gluten, affects fewer than one in a thousand people annually. Those diagnosed with this condition should avoid gluten, but for most, gluten poses no health risk.
It's true that most wheat grown in America has been significantly modified, resulting in a higher gluten content, which may cause sensitivity in some people. However, many who experience issues with American wheat report no problems when consuming wheat in Europe or India.
The issues often attributed to gluten are more closely related to industrial farming practices. For example, combine harvesters used on these farms cannot process green, unripe wheat, so fields are sprayed with a chemical called Roundup to dry the crops uniformly. Roundup, commonly used for weed control, has been linked to several health issues, including cancer, and has led to numerous lawsuits. The company has lost several lawsuits and many are pending in higher courts. 
Many who believe they are sensitive to gluten are likely experiencing the Nocebo effect rather than an actual reaction to gluten. This was supported by a recent international, multicentre, double-blind, placebo-controlled study published on PubMed (ID# 38340757) titled “The effect of expectancy versus actual gluten intake on gastrointestinal and extra-intestinal symptoms in non-celiac gluten sensitivity.” The study concluded that symptoms were influenced more by the expectation of gluten intake rather than by gluten itself.
Furthermore, the low-carb movement (including the Atkins Diet and books like *Wheat Belly* and *Grain Brain*) often spreads confusion and misinformation. These diets, heavily promoted by the meat, poultry, and dairy industries, advocate for high-protein, low-carb eating, aligning with interests in the animal food industry, which is inherently low in carbohydrates.
Such diets are not only misleading but potentially harmful in the long run. For instance, Dr. Atkins, who launched the low-carb trend with his book in the 1970s, reportedly suffered from several health issues related to his diet and weighed over 300 pounds at his death.

Soy or Not?
A common question relates to consuming soy products. The market offers a variety of soy products such as edamame, soybeans, soy sauce, soy milk, tofu, tempeh, soy nuggets, soybean oil, and soy protein powder. Of these, soybean oil and soy protein powder should be avoided, while others can be consumed in moderation.

Soy Milk 
Making vegan milk at home is a good option. While store-bought vegan milk might contain preservatives, it's still preferable to dairy. Everyone has different tastes, and it's important to find the type you enjoy most. For those with children who love milk, consider making two different varieties to avoid over-reliance on soy milk.

Tofu
Due to societal biases towards protein, as previously discussed, it has become fashionable in restaurants and homes serving vegetarian food to include paneer, tofu, and soy nuggets. There's a prevailing belief that vegetarian meals must include additional protein-rich foods like paneer or soy; otherwise, the meal is considered incomplete. At Indian parties, for instance, you'll commonly find dishes like Paneer Tikka, Saag Paneer, Mutter Paneer, and Malai Kofta. I've attended Indian parties where the only vegan options were daal, which typically includes ghee tadka.
The situation with tofu is similar in Chinese, Vietnamese, and Korean restaurants, where vegetarian or vegan dishes predominantly feature tofu, driven by the misconception that a vegan meal without tofu is incomplete—even master chefs share this myth.
Soy was not traditionally part of the Indian diet, which favored daal, rajma, and chole. Soy was introduced to India in the late 1960s. Globally, most soy is used as animal feed or for biodiesel. In the United States 70% is used for animal feed and 5% for biodiesel, with all soy produced being genetically modified (GMO). Scientifically, soy is controversial, but the consensus is that it's harmless in small amounts. There is nothing wrong with eating tofu in moderation—only consume it if you enjoy it, not because it's considered a health food. Personally, I prefer edamame (fresh soybeans); they make a great appetizer.

How Much Salt? 
There is considerable confusion regarding the role of salt in maintaining good health, fueled by conflicting studies. However, beneath the surface, there appears to be some consensus. The views of Dr. John McDougall, one of my mentors, help to clarify this issue:
"Many doctors conveniently scapegoat salt, attributing numerous chronic problems to the consumption of excessive salt."

Historically, salt has been a crucial part of our diet. Slaves were often traded for salt. The word "salary" also originated from the term for salt, leading to the idiom "not worth his salt."

Salt consumption varies widely around the world - from less than 200 mg daily among the Yanomamo Indians in the Amazon Basin of Brazil to 27,000 mg among farmers in Northern Japan. The average American consumes about 3,500 mg of salt a day.
People who adhere to a natural, plant-based, whole food diet generally maintain their health regardless of salt intake. Research indicates that these individuals, when relocated to urban environments and subjected to a modern Western diet, develop hypertension and other chronic diseases.
The human tongue is naturally inclined to seek out sugar and salt, with these taste buds located at the very tip of the tongue. Fortunately, the human body has a natural ability to regulate salt through the intestines—which can increase or decrease sodium absorption—and through the kidneys, which adjust the amount of salt lost in urine and sweat.
Recent large-scale studies from the past decade have found a low correlation between salt intake and cardiovascular disease, and there might even be an inverse correlation. Among individuals with hypertension, reducing salt intake as a means to lower blood pressure may actually be associated with higher rates of cardiovascular diseases.

So, what is the real issue?
The problem lies in the company that salt keeps. Processed foods such as bacon, ham, salami, chips, fries, pizza, bagels, cheese, ice cream and Haldiram’s namkeen (in India), are the true culprits. In the US, 75% of dietary salt comes from processed foods.
It is nearly impossible to maintain a low-salt diet if you consume a standard diet based on animal products. Meat does not taste good without salt, and most poultry sold has been injected with saline water. Try eating salt-free cheese or boiled lamb, pork, or chicken—it's difficult to swallow. Animal-based foods are so bland that they require significant amounts of salt to be palatable.
When you eat fruits, vegetables, beans, rice, nuts and seeds, minimal salt is needed to enhance the flavor of the food. This is the secret: We should avoid processed and refined foods and stop worrying about salt. Keeping a salt shaker on your dining table won’t hurt.

In conclusion, it's important to be critical of dietary trends that seem too aligned with commercial interests or that promise quick fixes. As the saying goes, "We love to read good things about our bad habits." I urge everyone to approach such claims with skepticism and to prioritize well-rounded, plant-based-whole-food nutrition.

[10/10/25, 7:24:36 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •• White Rice vs Other ••

A question often asked of me is what is the best rice to eat or is white rice okay or should one change over to brown rice. 
If you are willing to try nonwhite rice than following rice are very good choices listed in order of declining nutrition value. 
1. Wild rice
2. Black rice
3. Purple rice
4. Red rice 
5. Brown rice
6. White rice

Brown rice has slightly more fiber than white rice. In one cup of brown rice you have 3.2 gram fiber instead of 1.7 gram in white rice. If you are consuming Standard American Diet (SAD), you hardly have any fiber in your diet so replacing one cup of rice from whit to brown may increase you fiber consumption by as much as 20-30 percent which is a significant improvement. In PBWF diet you daily fiber consumption is very high and replacing while rice with brown rice makes a negligible difference. So my recommendation is to eat which ever rice you like or your recipe calls for. 
One problem with brown rice is that it has arsenic which is very harmful. So it is a trade off. The issue of arsenic in rice is dependent on the location where the rice is grown. The problem in US is worse than in other places. 
But the point that I have tried to highlight is that just because a food is slightly processed as in white rice, it does not make it unhealthy. 
Processed food are bad for many reasons:
1. Unhealthy processes change the nature of the food. 
2. Many additives are added which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) but very unhealthy never the less. For example hydrogenated oils are classified as GRAS even though we l ow they are very unhealthy. 
3. Heavy extraction is done as in oils and sugars and high fructose corn syrup. 

None of the above apply to white rice. Please watch linked videos on the subject. 👇

[10/11/25, 7:08:02 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •FAT ? Yes. But no Oil•

In a plant-based whole food (PBWF) diet and lifestyle, the use of oil is discouraged. Instead, it is recommended to consume butters made from nuts and seeds. Humans evolved over millions of years consuming natural foods, which our bodies adapted to digest and absorb efficiently. Processing and refining these foods alters their composition, forcing the body to adjust and compensate, often leading to chronic illnesses. Here are the primary reasons why oils are  unhealthy and should be avoided:

1. Increased Triglycerides
Consuming oil, stripped of the fiber it was embedded in, quickly raises triglyceride levels in the blood, making it more viscous. This forces the heart to pump harder, raising blood pressure (BP). High BP can damage the kidneys and capillaries in vital organs like the brain and lungs over a few hours. This higher BP is not the same thing as the one caused by atherosclerosis which leads to hypertension. This higher BP is only for a few hours while your body is trying to get rid of the triglycerides by putting them into your fat cells.
If you were to just have one oily meal in a week and be done with it, not much harm would be done. But if you are having three oily meals a day and snacks in between, day after day, this harm becomes chronic.
2. Imbalance of Fatty Acids
Most cooking oils contain high levels of omega-6 fatty acids compared to omega-3. Omega-6 is pro-inflammatory and can disrupt cardiovascular health when out of balance with omega-3, leading to cardiovascular diseases.
3. Endothelial Dysfunction
Oils impair the function of endothelial cells—lining the blood vessels—by inhibiting their ability to release nitric oxide, which is crucial for smooth blood flow. This can increase blood pressure.
4. Increased LDL Cholesterol
The body produces the amount of cholesterol it needs. Inflammatory responses from excess omega-6 require more cholesterol for healing, elevating blood levels.
5. Insulin Resistance
Oils contribute to the accumulation of lipids in muscle cells, hindering insulin’s ability to deposit glucose, which necessitates increased insulin production by the pancreas, leading to insulin resistance—a precursor to type-2 diabetes.
6. Oxidative Stress
Excessive omega-6 fats can make cellular functions more reactive to oxygen causing oxidative stress.
7. Trans Fats
Despite the FDA banning all hydrogenated trans fats in the U.S. as of June 2018, they may still be available in other countries. Dalda in India and Crisco in US are two examples of such fats. Trans fats are extremely harmful.
8.Artery Clogging
Saturated fats in oils can directly block arteries, potentially causing strokes and heart attacks, especially in individuals with atherosclerosis.
9. Gastrointestinal Damage
Oils can damage epithelial cells that line the gastrointestinal tract, weakening it and leading to a “leaky gut,” which is the foundation for various autoimmune diseases.
As outlined, the consumption of oils not only raises the risk of cardiovascular diseases but also contributes to diabetes, cancer, strokes, asthma, arthritis, and many autoimmune diseases.
Exceptions Allowed for Oil 
Before discussing allowances, it’s crucial to understand that lifestyle diseases develop on a continuum, beginning when a child is weaned from breast milk. One method to evaluate health is by examining five metabolic markers:
1. Waist (abdomen) size exceeding half of one’s height.
2. Blood pressure above 130/85.
3. Triglycerides over 150.
4. HDL cholesterol below 40.
5. Fasting glucose above 100.
If an individual exhibits three of these conditions, they are diagnosed with Metabolic Syndrome. Without any of these conditions, a person is generally considered healthy. The exceptions allowed depend on one’s age and health status, as indicated by these markers. Here are the oil/ghee allowances:
1. Under age 30 with no chronic diseases or metabolic markers: 6 teaspoons of oil/ghee.
2. Over age 40 with no chronic diseases or metabolic markers: 5 teaspoons of oil/ghee.
3. No chronic diseases but one metabolic marker: 4 teaspoons of oil/ghee.
4. No chronic diseases but two metabolic markers: 3 teaspoons of oil/ghee.
5. Previously had chronic diseases, now reversed and off medications for at least two years: 3 teaspoons of oil/ghee.
6. Chronic diseases recently reversed and off medications: 2 teaspoons of oil/ghee.
7. Suffering from one or more chronic diseases: No oil/ghee allowed.
To maintain adequate Omega-3 intake, consume one tablespoon of flaxseed, chia seed, or hemp seeds daily.
Weaning off oil: Practical suggestions
1. Use freshly made nut or seed butters and coconut butter instead of oil.
2. For those who employ cooks, instruct them to mix some water with mustard oil and ghee. Explain that this mixture, prescribed by a doctor, should be shaken well before use. This technique allows for continued recipe use while reducing total oil/ghee consumption. Start with a 50/50 mixture and gradually increase the water percentage.
3. Calculate the total monthly oil/ghee allowance and provide only that amount at the beginning of the month, instructing that it must last until the end. Many members of my health groups have successfully implemented these strategies.
Here is a video by Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn of Cleveland Heart Clinic on the subject.

[10/11/25, 7:08:03 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: In my course, I emphasize that potatoes are among the most nutritious vegetables you can eat. Many people mistakenly believe that potatoes are harmful for diabetics and avoid them altogether. However, recent research from Harvard University supports my recommendations. The real issue with French fries lies in the oil they’re cooked in—not the potatoes themselves. 👇
https://www.harvardmagazine.com/2025/08/harvard-study-potatoes-fries-diabetes-risk
[10/11/25, 7:08:04 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: The focus among diabetics to keep blood sugar levels low is totally misplaced. Most low glycemic foods are animal based or refined oils both of which are very harmful. Complex starches found in PBWFoods are the healthiest foods and help reverse diabetes by increasing insulin sensitivity. My diabetic patients get off medications within a month or two.
[10/12/25, 6:40:34 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •WHAT ABOUT EGGS?

A frequently asked question is about eating eggs. Many vegetarians eat eggs because they are not fertilized, meaning no harm is caused to any animal. I initially mentioned that there are various reasons for adopting a Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, one being the religious principle of Ahimsa, which promotes non-violence towards animals. Although this is not my primary reason for this group, I encourage you all to watch documentaries showing the conditions in poultry farms. After seeing them, you might reconsider eating eggs or chicken. However, in this post, I will focus solely on the health aspects.

Reasons to Avoid Eggs

1. Inflammation:
Eggs are inflammatory, and studies suggest they can increase the risk of dying from heart disease and strokes. According to a study published in the journal “Circulation”, researchers conducted a systematic review of existing research on 27,000 participants and found that eating one egg per day substantially increases the risk of dying from heat disease. 

2. IGF-1 Hormone & Cancer:
Egg whites are rich in IGF-1 (Insulin-like Growth Factor-1) hormone, which promotes the growth of cancer cells. In today’s society we all have tiny cancer cells floating in our body fluids. IGF-1 hormone promotes the growth in these cells. 
This hormone can also promote angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, which can lead to tumors. Prostate and Colorectal cancers are specifically linked to eggs. 

3. Lack of Fiber:
Eggs contain no fiber, causing their nutrients to be absorbed quickly in the small intestines, leaving little for colon bacteria. This can lead to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases as bacteria consume the mucosal layers of the colon.

4. Cholesterol:
Eggs are high in cholesterol (200mg in a medium-sized egg), raising serum cholesterol levels. Although the link between cholesterol and cardiovascular diseases is debated, it often leads to the prescription of statin drugs, which have harmful side effects. The number needed to treat (NNT) for statins is 217 for heart attacks and 313 for strokes, while the number needed to harm (NNH) is only 21, meaning one in 21 people experiences muscle loss from statins. 

5. High Saturated Fat Content:
Eggs are 60% fat, mostly saturated fat, which makes them inflammatory and contributes to insulin resistance, leading to diabetes and other diseases. According to a study, published in British Journal of Nutrition, eating one or more eggs per day can increase the risk of getting diabetes by 60%. 

6. Hygiene Concerns:
The conditions in which chickens are kept are often unhygienic, making eggs a risk for infectious diseases like salmonella and bird flu. Fully cooking eggs can reduce this risk, but many people consume partially cooked eggs.

Misleading Ads by Egg Industry 
Due to their high cholesterol content, the egg industry has faced challenges in combating resistance to egg consumption. In the mid-1990s, the Federal Trade Commission took successful legal action, upheld by the Supreme Court, to stop the egg industry from making false and misleading claims about the health effects of eggs.
A video by Dr. Michael Greger  (posted at the end of this blog) highlights how the industry  became desperate, and why they could not legally claim that eggs are healthy or even safe according to the US government. 

When multiple nutrients, which are often consumed together, are researched it becomes easy to achieve intended results by  structuring studies creatively. 
Studies funded by the egg industry suggested that increased cholesterol intake did not cause additional harm, leading the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) to remove restrictions on eggs in 2015. However, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) took no action and still considers cholesterol levels above 199 a disease to be treated with statin drugs. This shows a disconnect within the federal government.
The human body produces cholesterol in the liver, and it is an important nutrient. When dietary cholesterol is low, the liver compensates by producing more. The relationship between cholesterol levels and heart attacks is complex and still highly debated in the medical community. 
A report by the Physician’s Committee for Responsible Medicine analyzed the funding and findings of various studies and concluded:

“The percentage of industry-funded studies increased over time, from 0% in the 1950s to 60% in 2010-2019. More than 85% of the research studies, regardless of funding sources, showed that eggs have unfavorable effects on blood cholesterol. But 49% of industry-funded publications reported conclusions that conflicted with actual study results, compared with 13% of non-industry-funded trials.”

This issue has received significant attention on social media, reflecting the ongoing controversy over egg consumption. Posted below are relevant YouTube videos worth watching on the subject. 👇

“The last 50 years of nutrition information in America is a big fraud and that is why diabetes has continued to increase.” 
  Dr. Robert Lustig, UCSF

Dr. Robert Lustig, who taught medical students at the University of California, San Francisco has made it a mission in his life to expose the sugar industry. He highlights the impact of refined sugar on coronary heart diseases (CHD), the leading cause of death worldwide. Dr. Lustig's YouTube video "Sugar: The Bitter Truth," released in 2011, went viral with over 24 million views to date. In 2014 he collaborated with Katie Couric, a well known American journalist, to create the documentary "Fed Up" which I strongly recommend.

In 1776 when the US became an independent country, the per capita daily consumption of added sugar was only two teaspoon per day. Today it is more than 17 teaspoons of added sugar per day and that is where lies the root cause of many lifestyle diseases. 

Types of Sugar
Food has mainly three types of sugar: ZGlucose, Fructose and Sucrose. Sucrose is a 50/50 combination of glucose and fructose molecules. Most fruits and vegetables provide both glucose and fructose but starches provide only glucose. The Human body and brain run on glucose. Most of the glucose (about 80%) metabolizes throughout the body and passes through the liver untouched. But all of the fructose gets metabolized in the liver. 
When food is absorbed, it reaches the liver first. Liver is the chemical factory of the body and it decides what to do with the food. It can do one of the following:
1.Pass on most of the glucose to the blood to be distributed throughout the body, keeping a small amount for itself to be converted into glycogen and stored. 
2.Convert fructose into glucose, if the glucose level in the blood is low. 
3.Convert fructose into fat, if the glucose level in the blood is high. 
4.Convert starch into glucose. 
5.Convert fat into glucose and/or ketone bodies if the sugar level in the blood is low. 

Why Refined Sugar is Unhealthy?
Here is a list of negative effects of consuming refined sugars on the human body, arranged in increasing order of complexity.
1. Refined sugar is calorie-dense, allowing excessive calorie consumption without feeling full which leads to weight gain and obesity.
2. Refined sugar is addictive, reducing control over eating habits, which leads to overeating and subsequent weight gain and obesity.
3. Refined sugar provides empty calories, depriving the body of nutrients that would otherwise come with natural sugars.
4. Refined sugar is inflammatory and contributes to atherosclerosis, the leading cause of heart attacks and strokes.
5. Consumption of sugar can cause skin problems like pimples and acne and can cause  premature skin aging and wrinkles.
6. Sexual Health: Refined sugar can reduce sex drive and lead to impotence (erectile dysfunction).
7. Digestive Health: Lacking fiber, refined sugar is quickly absorbed in the small intestine, leaving nothing for colon microbes. This disrupts the gut microbiome, potentially leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.
8.Fructose in refined sugar causes ectopic fat formation in the liver (causing NAFLD), around vital organs (leading to visceral fat), and within muscle cells (Intramyocellular lipids) causing insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes).
9. Refined sugar causes glycation and formation of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (AGE) which reduce the life of organs. 
10. Refined sugar feeds cancer cells, promoting cancer growth.
11. High blood sugar, as seen in uncontrolled diabetes, can lead to numerous problems such as heart disease, kidney failure, stroke, gangrene, blindness, Alzheimer's, depression, and more.
Some of these are obvious but others require further elaboration. 

1. Glycation: 
When a sugar molecule binds to a fat or protein molecule, it is called glycation. When we roast food at high temperatures it turns reddish brown quickly. This process happens slowly in our bodies at 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to aging. Eating refined sugar without fiber results in rapid glycation. The faster glycation occurs, the quicker 
aging occurs. 

2. Oxidative Stress
Sugar molecules combined with oxygen produce energy and release oxygen elements, which lead to oxidative stress. Antioxidants in our food neutralize these elements. Glucose is stable in ring form, but fructose is less stable in its linear form and gets glycated at a much faster rate than glucose. This is why processed foods and sugary sodas with high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) are more harmful than natural sugar in food.

3. Metabolism of Fructose
When consumed as refined sugar, it gets absorbed quickly in the small intestine. The liver allows the glucose in sugar to pass through in the blood but it has two choices as far as fructose is concerned. It can convert fructose into either glucose or fat, depending upon the body's needs. Fast absorption of refined sugar overloads the liver, leading to the creation of ectopic fat, which spills over into various parts of the body:
1. Some of the newly formed fat spills over in the liver itself. This causes a disease called Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD). 
2. Some of the fat gets attached to vital organs making them lethargic. This is called visceral fat. This is quite toxic. 
3. Tiny particles of fat also get in between muscles cells called Intramyocellular lipids. These tend to block the insulin receptors on muscle cells causing insulin resistance. Insulin resistance is the main cause of Type 2 diabetes. 
Refined sugar (not natural sugar in food) is responsible for diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart diseases. Dr. Robert Lustig has demonstrated that consuming the same amount of calories in sugary soda leads to an eleven-fold increase in diabetes. He also shows that refined sugar and High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS) consumption causes liver fat.
There are many videos by Dr. Robert Lustig  that discuss why sugar is addictive and harmful. I have attached a short 7-minute video by Dr. Robert Lustig and a British documentary that effectively communicate this message. For a deeper understanding of the technical mechanisms behind sugar's harmful effects, watch Dr. Lustig's detailed lecture. Here are the links to pertinent videos. 👇

[10/13/25, 8:24:26 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •STOMACH ISSUES ON  A PBWF DIET

Switching to a plant-based whole food (PBWF) diet, particularly incorporating green smoothies or juices, may lead to stomach issues. These issues often depend on your previous diet and lifestyle. For instance, if your previous diet lacked fiber, you might notice changes in your bowel movements. Here are some signs and symptoms that might indicate you're increasing your fiber intake too rapidly.

Constipation or Diarrhea
Excess fiber can lead to constipation or diarrhea. Fiber acts as bulk that draws water into the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. If you're not hydrated enough, this can cause the GI tract to dehydrate, making stools hard and difficult to pass—common with soluble fiber. Conversely, too much insoluble fiber can cause diarrhea and loose stools. It's best to increase your fiber intake gradually to avoid these issues.

Bloating
Rapidly increasing your fiber intake can cause bloating. This is because the fiber isn’t fully digested as it moves through the GI tract, which is exacerbated when consuming smoothies due to the finely mixed air.
Consuming too much fiber can also create uncomfortable symptoms like bloating. 
This most often happens when you eat too much fiber too quickly because most of the fiber won’t be digested or broken down while moving through the GI tract. Bloating is also quite common when you consume smoothies as their is air mixed finely in the smoothies. 
Gas Problems
Increasing fiber feeds the microorganisms in your colon's microbiome, leading to gas production. This is more of a social issue than a health problem, as all mammals pass gas.
Abdominal Pain
Excessive fiber can slow down digestion or even cause it to stop, leading to cramping along with changes in bowel movements, gas, and bloating.
Mineral Deficiencies 
Fiber can bind to some nutrients, preventing their absorption. This is especially true for minerals like iron, chromium, copper, zinc, and calcium. Consuming adequate amounts of vitamin C may help counteract this effect.

What To Do?
Typically, the stomach stabilizes within a few days or weeks. If issues persist, If it persists you may be eating too much fiber, consuming it too quickly, consuming the wrong kind of fiber, or be in need of some extra vitamin C. Consider the following:
- Identify and eliminate specific foods causing issues.
- Gradually reduce and then slowly increase your intake of juice and other fibrous foods.
- For constipation, increase your intake of insoluble fiber; for loose stools, switch to soluble fiber.
- Ensure you're drinking enough water if constipated.

Skin Issues
Losing a significant amount of fat can sometimes lead to skin issues like pimples. These typically resolve over time. Human body can hide away some toxins in fat.,As the body burns fat for energy during ketosis, it may release stored toxins, which the skin then tries to eliminate.

Addictions & Withdrawal Symptoms 
When our body and mind become accustomed to certain patterns of behavior, they resist sudden changes. Regular consumption of specific beverages and foods stimulates dopamine release, temporarily enhancing our mood. Once the effect wears off, the body returns to normal or experiences a low, creating a desire for more. 
These foods and beverages are inherently addictive. Furthermore, every cell in our body contains a clock programmed to a set pattern of behavior. 
Consuming addictive substances at regular intervals can cause significant harm. A change in dietary habits and behavioral patterns is often resisted by the body, leading to what we refer to as withdrawal symptoms. While these are commonly recognized with substances like alcohol, tobacco, and drugs, they also apply to caffeine and certain common foods.
Caffeine is particularly addictive and can impair the ability to perform daily activities without it. Many regular consumers of tea or coffee develop a dependence, with headaches being a common withdrawal symptom. Those who attempt intermittent fasting by delaying their morning meal until after 10:00 AM often experience this. The reason caffeine is so addictive is its integral role in our daily routines and social interactions.
Caffeine increases the production of the neurotransmitter dopamine, which affects our attention level.
Here are some withdrawal symptoms of caffeine and food addiction.
Our body runs on a circadian rhythm and we now know that every cell has a circadian clock inside which learn our pattern of life and works accordingly. When this pattern is disturbed it doesn’t like it. The research has shown that it takes our body 3 weeks to develop a new habit or modify old habits. 

Headache
Regular caffeine consumption reduces cerebral blood flow due to the narrowing of blood vessels. Although blood flow initially increases after caffeine intake, it soon diminishes, and the expected circadian rhythm-associated boost at a specific time leads to headaches if caffeine is not consumed.
It happens within 1-4 hours of missing the regular dose of caffeine. It is usually most common among people who consume three or more cups of coffee/tea each day. 
Constipation
Those accustomed to starting their day with tea or coffee may experience constipation when they stop. Both caffeine and hot water stimulate bowel movements and therefore abruptly stopping caffeine intake can cause constipation. The name bed- tea originated first this reason only. 
Substituting with warm water in the morning or herbal teas later in the day can help, especially for those practicing intermittent fasting.
Fatigue
Caffeine increases alertness by blocking adenosine receptors, a neurtotransmitter that induces feelings of tiredness. Without this stimulant, feelings of fatigue can occur. The habit of late afternoon cup of coffee causes slow down an hour or two after lunch. 
Brain Fog
The release of dopamine from consuming caffeine and other addictive foods sharpens our attention. Without regular intake, our attention span may become foggy.
Irritability
Low energy and headaches can lead to irritability. Techniques like deep breathing (Pranayama), stretching, or stepping outside can alleviate this symptom.
Anxiety & Depression
Caffeine addiction can make some individuals feel jittery and anxious, and for some, stopping caffeine can produce similar effects. Additionally, because caffeine elevates mood, its absence can lead to depression.
Nausea
Withdrawal from caffeine can disrupt the digestive system and sometimes causing nausea.
Insomnia 
This comes as a surprise to many because normally we associate inability to sleep with coffee consumption. But stopping coffee habit abruptly can also cause insomnia. 
Tremors 
Some individuals may experience involuntary shaking, typically of the hands, as a withdrawal symptom.

How to Overcome Caffeine & Food Addictions?
For those struggling to quit, gradually, reducing consumption over a week or substituting with healthier options like herbal teas, or green juices or fresh fruits, can be effective. Here are some suggestions. 

- Drink a small glass of green juice.
- Enjoy herbal teas like ginger, cardamom, or cinnamon.
- Try hibiscus tea, suitable for all-day consumption.
- Snack on fresh fruits, cucumbers, or carrots.
- Engage in physical activities like stretching, deep breathing, or short walks outdoors. 

Food as an Addiction
Apart from well-known addictive substances like caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco, certain foods can also be highly addictive, including sugar, cheese, chocolate, potato chips, French fries, ice cream, breakfast cereals, pizzas, biscuits, and cakes. These addictions can surface during periods of fasting like Ekadashi and Navratri, highlighting our dependencies.

Our bodies operate on a circadian rhythm, learning and adapting to our life patterns. Disturbing this rhythm is met with resistance, but research shows it takes about three weeks for the body to develop new habits or modify existing ones. Managing withdrawal symptoms during this period, or gradually introducing changes, can help ease the transition.

[10/13/25, 8:24:27 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••   CHEAT DAYS   •••

A question is often asked about cheat days. When meeting, friends and family, business acquaintances outside of our homes, weddings, parties etc, we are faced with situations where the food is not PBWFood compliant or the eating window can not be maintained. So the question is how to deal with it? In this post I want to cover such issues. 
1. As far as physical activity is concerned it is not critical that each day be fully compliant. It is perfectly alright to maintain a weekly average of 70,000 steps. So if you are not able to make 10,000 steps, just make up on the next day or, if you have advance notice, you can do extra steps on the day before. 
2. As far as maintaining an eating window of 8 hours is concerned, again it is no big deal. If on a particular day your eating window is longer, just make up on the adjoining day by narrowing down your eating window, as long as the weekly average is maintained at 8 hours or less. 
3. On the issue of compliance to PBWFood, it is easier if you are on a budget of two teaspoons of oil and sugar. When ever you find yourself consuming more oil or sugar than allowed, just make up for it by eating less oil and sugar on the following or the preceding days. 
4. If you are still on medications and do not have a daily allowance available to offset, the best approach is to make up by doing additional water fast, over and above your biweekly fast. 
5. When faced with buffet meals, most buffets have some dishes which are safe like salads, lentils, rice and bread. Some also have fruit salads and potato chat. You have to make your own selection. 
6. Soon the word spreads and your friends will know that you have dietary restrictions. If you are a leader within your social group, you will find that within 3 months every one will be following you. If not, but your friends are good friends they will start making some dishes for you. If not, it is time for you to drop them and make new friends. 
7. Sometimes It is not a bad idea to eat before going to such parties. 
8. If you find that you were forced to eat something unhealthy, you can always compensate by doing a 24 hour water fast the next day. My wife and I fast every week, it makes it easy to make exceptions. 
9. Remember water fasting or dry fasting are the two most powerful tools in your Arsenal. Use them whenever you confront a cheat day.
[10/13/25, 8:24:29 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •• How and When to Stop Medications ••

It has only been three days and I have started receiving enquirers from some members, whether to stop medications. I want to make some clarifications :

1. I am not a doctor. I do not diagnose symptoms. I only diagnose diet and lifestyle. 

2. I can not and will not advise you on medications. That is totally your decision. My goal is to empower you to make such decisions and not to make them for you. I have told you that Dr. John McDougall asks all his patients to stop medications before starting his 10 day live in program at Santa Rosa, California. He does that because changing diet to plant based whole food, reduces your markers rapidly and continuing medication can lead to hypoglycemia amongst diabetic patients. So diabetic patients for sure need to reduce insulin and medications but in consultation with their doctors. 

3. What I coach, in terms of diet and lifestyle, will help improve your symptoms and their markers like BP, Blood Sugar, Cholesterol will improve. As these markers improve you can share them with your doctor and ask if you can reduce or stop medications. Some doctors are of old school and have been led to believe that medications for lifestyle diseases should never be stopped and continued for the whole life. They may advise you against it. In which case you may want to consider a second opinion. 

4. The latest research has shown that controlling symptoms too aggressively for a disease can damage overall health, even though it is keeping in check a particular marker for that particular disease. It is for this reason there is lot of debate in the last decade and many guidelines for aggressive medication are being revised. Not all doctors are aware of these revisions. Also such revisions have led to differences in guidelines for BP or Blood Sugar by different professional medical associations. We will discuss these matters in more detail next month when we discuss each disease in more detail.

5. I am strictly against stopping medications before making dietary changes. I have come across case where people stop medications thinking that from tomorrow they will be on new diet anyway and then that tomorrow gets delayed because they couldn’t decide on the juicer or the sale on the juicer starts only after another week. So dietary changes get delayed. Always make sure that dietary changes precede medication reduction and not the other way round. 

As regards to the pace at which the medications will get reduced; it is a function of your compliance to the guidelines and severity and history of illness. 
I have seen some members reduce their medication by half every week and some more or less aggressively. 
Obviously, if the revised guideline is such that you should never have been on medication in the first place, your doctor would concur to stop medication immediately. For example the revised guidelines for BP are 140/90 for people under age 60 and 150/90 for ages over 60. 
The revised guidelines for Diabetic is A1C of 7.9. So if your A1C is over 8.0 you must continue on medication but if less than you must reduce medication. 

I hope I have clarified some doubts as to how and when to get off medications.
[10/13/25, 8:24:30 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Why One Diet for All Ills?•

Most people who join my health group bring a belief with them that there must be a different diet plan recommendation  for different illnesses. Even though my post on the very first day of the session, clarifies that there is only one diet, for all ills, the most frequently asked questions is “I have following symptoms....x, y, z, what should my diet be?
This is probably the biggest myth, even surpassing the protein myth. 

Just imagine,  you were suffering  from diseases X, Y and Z and you were prescribed the
following diet:

For disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P

For disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R
and avoid  C, G, M, S & Q

For disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S
and avoid  A, G, K, P & T

Now, how will you figure out what to eat and what to avoid. The premise, that there is a special diet for every disease, is fundamentally flawed. When you eat PBWF diet with a diverse variety, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and all deficiencies are removed. So, there is no special need for supplements. Similarly, when you eat a variety of foods and allow your body to decide when you have had enough, as opposed to force feeding one supplement or the other, there are no excesses. There are exceptions to this rule, but most relate to (1) when you are eating processed refined foods which disturb the natural balance of nutrients (2) When you consume medications which may interfere with absorption of some nutrients over other (3) When you consume supplements, they interfere with body’s ability to absorb other nutrients, creating imbalances. 

It is for these reasons, my highest priority is, to help you get off medications and supplements (except B12). Once you achieve that, and are off all medications, your body recuperates and achieves a proper balance. My recommendation to “eat everything you like and some that you don’t” is to ensure that you are getting a diverse variety of food. My insistence on eating berries, nuts, seeds, herbs and spices is also to provide a diverse variety. Superfoods like Aamla, Giloy, Turmeric, Garlic, Haritaki, Tulsi, Bibhitaki etc. should be made a part of daily food recipes, rather than taking them as supplements. 
Those who know cooking, know that different spices need to be added in different amounts; you can’t add as much cayenne pepper as coriander powder in a dish. One obviously needs to learn these things as a part of cooking classes and not nutritional coaching. This is not my area of expertise, and my guideline is quite simple; listen to your body, if it likes the food have more, if it doesn’t agree with it, stop. 
Certain groups and organizations benefit from propagating this myth. They want you to believe that this is a very complex science and you need to visit them and under their supervision alone your health will improve. I remember when my wife visited Jindal Spa in Bangalore she was told that every patient will receive a different diet which is customized for them. It created a sense of awe as to how refined these people are. I see this happening all around. Ayurveda masters telling you that you have to visit there center and live for a month to get cured. This is not necessary. It is not a difficult science at all. You do not need to go to any spa or Ayurvedic retreat; you can realize the benefits at the privacy of your home. If you want to get pampered, then go to a spa but it isn’t necessary for the health reasons. These are all marketing gimmicks used to make you feel weak and deprived.
[10/13/25, 8:24:31 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••FACTS from FICTION••
How to Navigate among Varying Opinions on Social Media?

This question gets asked often. The social media and specially YouTube is full of varying opinions so how do I navigate it. Here are some suggestions which I practice. 

1. One must eliminate all anecdotal evidences. Videos by people of their personal experiences. 

2. One must eliminate self appointed coaches who are not educationally qualified. For example just because your coach at gym has a great body doesn’t mean that the protein powder he is pushing you to buy will get you that body. YouTube is full of those. 

3. Having narrowed down to qualified people like nutritionists, doctors, professors and PhDs, try to understand their logic in the explanation, is it consistent with what you have learned so far; if not, is the evidence based on double blind studies that have been peer reviewed. Do you smell bias based on food, Pharma or health care industries interest. Was the research funded by independent agency like National Institute of Health (NIH) or some other well recognized international organization or university. 

4. Does the expert have an ax to grind or a turf to protect. Does he have a conflict of interest. 

5. Now if there are genuine differences in the recommendations of the two experts, apply some acid test. Is the expert following his own advice? Does his health and physical appearance support his argument. Dr. Atkins advised everyone to follow his low carb high fat diet to lose weight but he himself was grossly overweight. When he died at the age of 72 he weighed 258 pounds. Many proponents of dairy and keto diets are overweight themselves. 

Those who survive to this point may be honest in their disagreements. When two doctors, I respect, are in conflict,  I apply some common sense and evaluate other available data, to come to my decision. I look at the findings from human evolutionary perspective as I discussed in my very first post on human evolution. Here are some examples of conflicts among the doctors I respect and follow:
1. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn doesn’t approve of fat even in natural forms like avocado, nuts and seeds. When you analyze his experience, he deals primarily with advanced stage heart patients who have been given a short life to live. His success rate is already 99.5%. Why should he change? He can’t afford to take any additional risk. 
2. Dr.John McDougall is opposed to more vegetables and fruits beyond a few servings. He wants you to eat more starch. That has been his life’s body of work and all his books are focused on that. He has no objection to raw fruits and vegetables; he just feels that they won’t fill your stomach. His argument against them is week and he does have a turf to protect. I do consider him my guru but I disagree on restricting fruits, vegetables.
3. Dr. McDougall in his seminars is very opposed to nuts and seeds beyond one oz. total. Most of his patients are fat and overweight, so I don’t blame him. In India I come across many patients who are underweight (BMI under 18.5), I advise them to increase consumption from the nuts & seeds group. 
4. Dr. Fuhrman recommends high consumption of fruits and vegetables but he sells food supplements that he manufactures. Most PBWF doctors disagree with that. 
5. Most of these doctors have developed a turf that they believe in and want to protect and have arguments to support them which sound reasonable on the surface and they are slow to adopt new research. For example many have not adopted the recent developments on fasting. I was quick to adopt that because of my Indian background, it resonated with me. Also two Nobel prizes (2016 and 2018) are pretty convincing. 

6. Dr. Jason Fung was the first to adopt fasting as a way to treat Diabetes. Before him fasting was a novelty, as a treatment of last resort. There were only few clinics worldwide. However Dr. Jason Fung’s focus on keto diet has been widely debunked but there is strong backing by the animal food industries.

As you can see there is no agreement even among the knowledgeable people. 
Over the years and based on the feedback from thousands of members, my guidelines have evolved to where they are today.

[10/13/25, 8:24:34 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••• 2 Most Frequently Asked Questions ••••

I will be opening the group for Q&A now. But before I do that I want you to understand that many of the most frequently asked questions are flawed to begin with. Here are two examples. 

1. “What should my diet be to prevent diabetes, stroke, heart attack, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, etc.?”

The problem with this question is that it assumes a different diet is needed to prevent each disease. If that were true, how would we choose which disease to prevent and which one to ignore? This logic simply doesn’t hold.

A truly healthy diet should benefit all chronic diseases. The PBWF/IF/10K diet and lifestyle I recommend does exactly that — it helps prevent and even reverse most chronic conditions.

Of course, for individuals with advanced disease, organ failure, or artificial implants, medical advice specific to their condition is necessary. That said, most elements of the diet are benign and generally safe. One notable exception is for those with advanced kidney disease, where some green leafy vegetables high in oxalates may need to be restricted.

2. “I have this symptom, and that one… what should my diet be?”

Here again, the same principle applies.

Nutrient deficiencies (or excesses) show up as symptoms, but those symptoms vary widely from person to person. While our genetics are quite similar, epigenetically we are all unique — so the symptoms of same deficiency might look completely different in different individuals.

What makes matters more complicated is that we usually don’t suffer from just one deficiency. When multiple deficiencies (or toxic excesses) are involved, the number of symptom combinations becomes enormous — possibly thousands or even millions. Expecting a doctor to diagnose these just by listening to your symptoms is unrealistic.

This is why treatment, whether conventional or alternative, often feels like trial and error. Another issue is reporting bias — people who don’t benefit from a treatment usually stay silent, but those who experience improvement tell everyone. For instance, someone might say, “I had this issue for 10 years, saw 10 doctors, and nothing worked. But this homeopath/Ayurvedic/alternative doctor cured me.” Excited, they share their experience with 10 others. The 9 others who didn’t benefit say nothing — but the one who did spreads the word widely, creating a false impression of a miracle cure.

The strength of the PBWF/IF/10K approach is that it naturally eliminates both deficiencies and excesses (which can also be toxic), allowing the body to heal. That’s why I recommend starting with a 3–5 day green juice fast. It offers deep detoxification and high-density nutrition — a powerful foundation for recovery.

Most problems we experience are systemic in nature and are result of many years of consuming unhealthy food and living an unhealthy lifestyle. It is not a good idea to correct the symptoms (high blood pressure or high blood sugar or high LDL cholesterol etcetera), even if you could, without addressing the root cause of them. Correcting symptoms with some concoction (Nani ka Nuskha) or herb is not a good idea. At least you are now conscious of the problem and willing to do something about it. If the symptoms are lowered without correcting the root cause, you will develop a false sense of relief. Your body will keep getting sicker and sicker and come back with bigger problems like heart attack or stroke. Killing messengers is never a good idea. 

When you follow the 12 point guidelines the root causes of lifestyle diseases get addressed and your body heals. And when the body heals, everything heals.

I am posting below the 12 point guidelines again in a summarized table. Please print it and post it on your refrigerator or desk. I get asked many times to repeat it.

[10/14/25, 2:13:52 AM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Good to know you follow intermittent fasting. Just to clarify, fasting doesn’t cause weight loss—it supports new cell generation and healing. If you feel fit and healthy, you can even try water fasting on Ekadashi or Navratri without any problem. The idea that fasting leads to weight loss is a myth.

During the last week before starting discussions in this group, while we were waiting for the discussion to start, I had recommended that certain documentaries be watched. Some of you who joined late and might have missed that post. My interest in PBWF started after watching a documentary on Neflix on January 1st 2013, “Forks over Knives”. I require all members to watch this documentary. Most documentaries are available on subscriptions sites like Netflix or Amazon Prime or on YouTube. Some are free and others you may have to rent. Here is a list of 11 documentaries I recommend. You can watch them at your convenience but please watch Forks over Knives ASAP. 
1. Forks over Knives
2. Forks over Knives: Extended Interviews
3. What the Health
4. Fat Sick and Nearly Dead
5. Super juice Me
6. Death By Medicine by Garry Null.
7. The Game Changers.
8. Eating
9. ⁠From Food to Freedom
10. Hungry for Change
11. H.O.P.E.

I am attaching links to a few but these may or may not work in all countries. You may have to rent them.

[10/15/25, 6:43:45 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: 2nd Pillar of Health: DETOXIFICATION 

Having completed the first and most important pillar of health—Food, we now move on to the second pillar of health—Detoxification. First, let's discuss the cellular structure of our body. 
Cells are the fundamental building blocks of all organisms. The human body is made up of over 37 trillion cells. Each cell consists of a cell membrane, nucleus, and cytoplasm containing various organelles. The cell membrane separates the cytoplasm and nucleus from the external environment, which contains nutrients. After nutrients penetrate the cell membrane, they are metabolized and turned into energy that fuels the cell’s life functions. The by-products of this metabolic activity are waste products that need to be removed from the cell through the same cell membrane. Any impairment in a cell's ability to let nutrients in or let waste out leads to death by starvation or toxicity. This concept in Yoga is called Prana and Apana. 
As you can see from this discussion, detoxification is almost as important as nutrition. For good health, it is necessary not only to avoid the absorption of toxins into our body by avoiding sources of toxins in our food and environment but also to engage in activities that facilitate their elimination. Clearly, our goal should be to reduce the level of toxins we absorb and regularly engage in ways to detoxify our body. There are two types of toxins: External and Internal. 

External Sources of Toxins
Our body can absorb toxins from the following sources:
1. The food we eat
2. The water we drink and bathe with
3. The air we breathe
4. The lotions we apply to our body
5. The household cleaners we use 
6. The medications we take

Major Sources of Toxins In Food
1. Hydrogenated Oil, also called vegetable shortening (Dalda & Crisco)
2. Artificial sweeteners
3. Mono Sodium Glutamate (MSG), commonly used in Chinese food
4. Preservatives in packaged foods classified as “Generally Recognized As Safe” (GRAS)
5. Pesticides in fresh produce
6. Traces of growth hormones, antibiotics, pesticides (fed to dairy cows), and pus in cow’s milk
7. Refined Sugar and/or High Fructose Corn Syrup (HFCS). All soft drinks and 80% of the packaged items in grocery stores have added sugar or HFCS.
8. Refined Oils with excessive Omega-6
9. Excessive Animal Protein
10. Municipal Water Supply
11. Alcohol and Tobacco

GRAS & CRISCO 
When we buy packaged food, we assume it is safe, believing some organization has ensured its safety. This is a common misassumption. “GRAS” stands for “Generally Recognized as Safe.” Many foods and additives fall into this category, with the burden of proof of safety lying with the food company.
A notable example of GRAS is vegetable shortening, also known as hydrogenated fat. In America "Crisco" is well-known while "Dalda" was popular in India. William Proctor and James Gamble, originally soap and candle makers, developed a process to hydrogenate oils, turning them into solids. This innovation led to the creation of Crisco, marketed as a healthier alternative to animal fats. Crisco became an overnight success. However, after more than a century, the scientific community recognized its fatal consequences, leading to bans in many countries. Despite this, trans fats like Crisco (Dalda) remain legal in India.

Internal Sources of Toxins
The metabolic activity in our body, involving various chemical reactions happening in our trillions of cells, also releases metabolic waste that needs to be cleared. Besides this there are four other internal toxins:

1.Dead and damaged cells
These cells release toxic chemicals damaging healthy cells adjoining them. 
2.Misfolded proteins 
Sometimes there is error in making new protein molecules and a mirror image gets created which is of no functional use. These just sit in our body and need to be removed. 
3.Senescent Cells
These are cells which have stopped reproducing. These hamper the functioning of the healthy cells around them. 

These internal toxins prematurely age our body. Their removal is of utmost importance for healthy aging. So the question arises: how do we remove these toxins from our body? The following list summarizes various detoxification techniques.

1.Body’s Natural Responses:
Breathing, sweating, urinating, and bowel movements are the body’s natural responses for regularly excreting waste and toxins. Additionally, when we consume food that our body recognizes as toxic, the body’s natural response is to vomit or pass it through the colon as loose motion.

2.Daily Routine:
Brushing teeth, showering, and bathing are part of our normal routine. Steam showers and saunas are also good detox practices.

3.Water Therapy:
There are several techniques for water therapy:
* Drinking 2-3 glasses of warm water first thing every morning is a good detox habit.
* In Japanese water therapy, it is recommended to drink one liter of water instead of 2-3 glasses. While I do not know enough to recommend it, intuitively, it should not be done more frequently than once a week.
* One of the Yoga techniques listed below as Dhauti (Varisara Dhauti, also known as Shankhaprakshalana) is also a water therapy.

4.Fasting:
Fasting is an ancient practice common in various forms in many cultures. It is no coincidence that two Nobel prizes in Physiology in the last seven years have been awarded for research on this subject. Intermittent fasting, also known as time-restricted feeding, is an ancient Indian practice known as Chauvihar among followers of the Jain religion. 
There are many clinics worldwide that focus on fasting, such as True North Health Center in Santa Rosa, California, which uses continuous water only fasting for up to 40 days to treat severely ill patients. I recommend the following fasting practices:
* 16:8 Intermittent Fasting to be practiced daily.
* One full day of water fasting every two weeks, similar to the custom of Ekadashi fasting in India, practiced on the 11th day of the lunar cycle. It can be practiced on any convenient day of the week, but that day must be followed every other week.
* Once or twice a year, a 9-day OMAD (One Meal A Day) fast, similar to the custom of Navratri fasting in India.
We will cover the subject of fasting separately in coming weeks. 

5.Yoga Techniques:
In ancient Indian Yoga practices, six techniques for internal cleansing are prescribed. These are collectively known as Shatkarmas and include:
   - Dhauti
   - Basti
   - Neti 
   - Trataka 
   - Nauli
   - Kapalbhati
Except for Kapalbhati and Neti, all others should only be done under expert supervision.

6.Colon Hydrotherapy:
The main goal here is to clear the colon of stagnant, supposedly toxic waste encrusted on colon walls. Doing so would enhance the vitality of the body. It also improves the immune system because 70% of our immune cells reside in our colon. Two of the Shatkarma techniques called Dhauti (Varisara) and Basti also achieve the same goal.

7.Yoga Asanas:
Hatha Yoga practice is a good way to detoxify our endocrine system. It also helps detoxify the lymphatic system.

8.Nadishodhan Pranayam:
Pranayama are breathing techniques that help remove toxins. Among various techniques, Nadishodhan is especially effective, and practicing it for 15-20 minutes every morning can help the body tremendously. Kapalbhati, another good technique (listed in section 5) is also beneficial.

9.Walking:
Walking is a very good way to detoxify our lymphatic system. Every cell in our body eliminates waste, which goes either into our lymphatic system or into the blood circulatory system. The lymphatic system does not have a pump like the blood circulating system. It works only by the movement of the body. Therefore, I recommend an active lifestyle with 10,000 steps each day. It is also important to include some arm raises as part of walking.

Conclusion:
The second pillar of health, Detoxification, emphasizes the importance of eliminating toxins from the body, complementing the first pillar, Food. Detoxification involves not only getting rid of external toxins but also removing cellular and metabolic waste to prevent toxicity. Effective detoxification methods must include fasting regimens in addition to daily hygiene routines, water therapy and walking.

[10/16/25, 7:01:00 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Intermittent Fasting (IF)•

Human  body evolved over millions of years eating mostly fruits and vegetables with some beans, cereals, nuts and seeds. Another observation about our evolution is that we finished our dinners by sunset and next morning we went in search of food, to return by late morning or early afternoon and prepared our lunch. The gap between the two meals was any where from 12-16 hours. It is only in last 10,000 years, when we settled down and started farming and keeping animals for milk and meat, that food became readily available to have morning breakfast. Prior to these 10,000 years, we faced periods of feasts and famine regularly. The result is that our body evolved to store surplus food in the form of fat in our fat cells. The number of fat cells stop increasing after certain age but each cell has almost unlimited capacity to store fat. Human body is very efficient in converting carbohydrates into fat and this is happening all the time. However the conversion of fat into energy, which again is a straight forward process, does not happen as easily any more. The reason for this is that we do not face any periods of famine any more. This is, as if, our body has forgotten how to burn fat to produce energy. 
This happens because, before we can burn all the calories from the previous meal, we eat another meal, that supplies fresh batch of calories. Many of us eat five meals a day; bed tea/coffee, breakfast, lunch, evening tea/coffee and dinner. Some take additional snacks in between or snacks with evening alcohol or a glass of milk before bedtime. The result is that our pancreas are releasing insulin all the time and the only rest they get is for 8 hours during sleep. This constant presence of insulin in our body from 7:00 in the morning to 11:00 at night leads to many chronic problems which we will discuss later but for now please understand the presence of insulin interferes with the ability to burn fat. 

Many of us incorrectly believe that during fasting the body must be slowing down the metabolic rate but the reverse is true. When body burns fat it produces ketones and the brain functions very well with ketones. The process is called Ketosis and during ketosis, when brain receives ketones, instead of glucose, it realizes that there is food shortage. The brain thereby increases the metabolic rate to sharpen the body and mind, as if it is telling you to go out and search for food. 
I highly recommended all to compress your eating window from 16 hours to a shorter period and increase the fasting window to a longer period. This concept is called Chauvihar in the Indian Jain community and “Intermittent Fasting” in the modern scientific community (also called “Time Restricted Feeding”). In addition, it helps the body heal better and develop better immunity when we subject it to periods of famine by fasting for a period of 16 hours or longer.

The concepts of  intermittent fasting (IF) and extended fasting have gained momentum in the western world only recently but it has been practiced in the East for thousands of years.
Based on research on mice, we have known for over six decades that regular fasting improves health and increases life expectancy by up to 50% in mice. However the reasons for this were not clear. The Nobel prizes in physiology in 2016 and 2018 have been awarded for research on this subject and now we understand the reasons also. 
The other terms used to describe the practice of IF are “Reduced Eating Window” or “Time Restricted Feeding”. The goal in intermittent fasting is to reduce your eating window to as narrow as possible. The ultimate in intermittent fasting is “One Meal A Day” (OMAD) plan; when your fasting window becomes 23 hours. Many Indian spiritual masters practice this. 

In intermittent fasting the idea is to finish your dinner early and delay your first caloric meal of the morning, so that the eating window can be narrowed to 8 hours or less. This helps in two main ways: 
(1) Firstly it gets the body used to the idea of burning fat to produce energy in the form of ketones. This increases the metabolic rate and thereby helps loose fat. 
(2) Secondly it promotes autophagy which has many detoxing benefits and builds immunity. Autophagy was first discovered by Belgian biochemist Dr. Christian De Duve,  who received a Nobel prize for his discovery in 1974. He discovered that every cell has a kind of recycling department called lysosome which is like the stomach of the cell having enzymes that can help recycle wasted protein into amino acids. Lysosome stores worn out or damaged tissues, food particles, bacteria, viruses and other junk that accumulates in the cells. Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi discovered that during fasting, the body is under stress and no new protein (amino acids) is available. At that time Lysosome decomposes waste proteins into amino acids which can be used to make new cells. 

During the fasting period it is best to avoid all beverages except plain water. Some doctors allow consumption of any beverage which do not have any calories eg. black coffee or tea or plain water with lemon, ginger, turmeric, or amla extract etc. There are mixed views on it. If your goal is only to lose weight and your caffeine addictions doesn’t allow keeping longer fasting windows with out caffeine consumption that it may be okay to consume black coffee or tea without sugar but if possible please avoid anything but water. 

Intermittent fasting can be started slowly by first observing a 12 hour fasting window and then increasing it to 14 hrs. and 16hrs. or more. 
There are other ways to do intermittent fasting called 5/2 or alternate day method where you reduce your meal to a low calorie (under 500 calories) on two days in a week or every alternate day. I do not recommend these approaches as your body’s circadian rhythm never gets used to the pattern and on fasting days you do feel hungry. In 16:8 pattern, within three weeks, your circadian rhythm takes over and you don’t feel hungry in the morning. 

Walking or exercising during the fasting window enhances the effect of IF. One mile walk is equivalent to one additional hour of fasting. Therefore it helps to do your exercises during the fasting window. 

When we eat frequently and for longer periods, our blood sugar stays elevated for longer than normal. This is because insulin can’t efficiently clear it – this leads to the formation of Advanced Glycation End Products (AGEs). This process accelerates aging by triggering inflammation, neuropathy, fine lines and wrinkles and much more.
The health benefits of intermittent fasting include following:
1. Reduction in fat mass
2. Increased insulin sensitivity 
3. Lower inflammation 
4. Improved heart function
5. Increased mitochondrial volume
6. Improved body repair processes
7. Aerobic endurance improvements. 

NOT FOR EVERYONE 
Intermittent fasting is not for everyone and following groups should avoid fasting window longer than 12 hours. 
1. Pregnant Women
2. Children under 16
3. People with eating disorders like bulimia
4. People with gall bladder issues. 

IF  SCORE   
There is a way to monitor your IF progress by computing your intermittent fasting score and tracking it.
• IF score is calculated weekly. 
• Compute the time gap between you last caloric food intake in the evening and the first caloric food intake of the morning (in hours).
• Add to this total miles walked or equivalent exercise, during this period (after dinner and before breakfast). This is your score for the day.
• Now add this score for the 7 days of the week and grade your self based on the following criteria:

A.  Over 140   Excellent 
B.  120-140    Very Good
C.  100-120   Good
D.   80-100     Fair
F.  Under 80   Poor

       SIDE  EFFECTS 

When one starts Intermittent Fasting some people are able to jump right into it very easily but others face some difficulties. Most side effects are temporary and due to adaptive process of the body. These go away within few days. If you experience hunger and are unable to keep a longer fasting window of 16 hours; it is a good idea to expand your fasting window slowly by one hour each week.
Here are some common side effects of Intermittent Fasting:

1. Headache, dizziness, mental fog and feeling a little sluggish. These are withdrawal symptoms because most people are addicted to food and when denied, they experience such withdrawal symptom. One reason for feeling this way is electrolyte imbalance. In the absence of salt, that comes from food, body looses water impacting the electrolyte balance. It is a good idea to drink water with some Himalayan salt and lemon juice mixed in. 

2. Mood Swings: Just another withdrawal symptom. 

3. Upon breaking fast one may feel bloated specially if you eat too much food. too quickly. 

4. Feeling nauseated when you eat. It may be due to sluggish liver and gall bladder and adaptive response of the body. Having ginger tea can help. This should go away within a few weeks. 

5. Experiencing Diarrhea: When we burn fat during ketosis, the fat cells also release some toxins which were stored in the fat cells over time. Human body has a defense mechanism called PPRAY pathway by which toxins are stored in the fat cells. These released toxins can cause diarrhea and be excreted. Taking a tablespoon of Psyllium husk in the morning can help with diarrhea. 

6. Acid Reflux: Take fresh lemon or lime juice and/or two tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with warm water in the morning. 

7. Feeling Cold: Again a temporary affect and goes away in few weeks. 

8. Insomnia: When we fast body experiences stress and produces counter regulatory hormones like Cortisol, Epinephrine, Noradrenaline, Glucagon and human growth hormones. This is body’s way of telling you to go search for food (instead of sleeping).

9. Hair Loss: This generally happens if you were deficient of nutrients in the first place. It is also temporary. Hair should grow back and better. 

10. Bad Breadth: This again is due to toxins released with fat. It is a temporary phenomenon and should go away once weight stabilizes. 

All side effects discussed above are due to adaptive response of the body and generally go away within a month or two. There are some other side effects which have more to do with the weight loss which involves fat burning. These can happen even after few months and one should be aware of them. 

1. Gout Pain: When we have high levels of inflammation, the body produces uric acid,  (which is actually an antioxidant) to deal with it. So fasting can spike uric acid in some people. If you are experiencing that, do the following: (1) reduce your fruit consumption (2) eliminate alcohol (3)avoid sugar.

2. Dr. Jason Fung mentions that there is some evidence that suggests that IF can  cause gall bladder stones. It is quite rare. Consumption of green juice should avoid this problem.
[10/16/25, 7:01:03 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Therapeutic Fasting•

Those among us who have never fasted find it very difficult to fast for even one day. By the time it is noon one begins to feel famished and all one can think of is food. Fasting as a therapeutic tool has been used in many parts of the world over past 100 years including Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and California. An early book on the subject “The Fasting Cure” was written in US by Upton Sinclair in 1911. There are clinics  in Russia, Germany, Switzerland, Spain and California, dedicated to curative healing by fasting. 

Considering that we all have enough fat in our body to last us 6 or more months, have you ever wondered why do we feel famished. There are two reasons:
(1) Firstly we have developed addiction to food  and when we do not get food in time we experience withdrawal symptoms like headaches as in any addiction. 
(2) The second reason is that although our body evolved over millions of years facing feast and famine regularly, the modern man rarely experiences famine,  and finds it very hard to deal with it even for a day. As if our body has forgotten how to burn fat.
Having said all that, I want to assure you that once you start practicing fasting and get over initial hurdle and the mental block, the process becomes very easy. More than 90% people report not feeling hungry, while doing prolonged fasting. I have already introduced to you the concept of intermittent fasting and many have started doing it; now we will talk about other types of fasts for therapeutic purposes. 

HOW DOES HUNGER WORK ?
Hunger has little to do with absence of food in the stomach and more to do with the release of a hormone called Ghrelin. 
Ghrelin is the hunger hormone that comes in waves. It makes us hungry at the same time every day as Ghrelin rises during meal times. This is why during prolong fasting first 2 days are the most difficult. 

BENEFITS  OF  FASTING 
• Fasting reduces fat mass by going into Ketosis
• Fasting reduces inflammation, 
• Fasting reduces triglycerides, 
• Fasting heals digestive system and guts
• Fasting lowers insulin, that helps increase insulin sensitivity and cure diabetes 
• Fasting reduces fatty liver
• Fasting raises human growth hormone (HGH) and releases brain derived neurotraffic  factor (BDNF). This helps in healing neurological disorders. 
• Fasting causes autophagy, which is a very powerful detoxing process where by, your body recycles waste protein within cells, dead cells, weaker cells, damaged cells and misfolded proteins. 2016  Nobel prize was awarded to Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi for his research on this subject. 
• Fasting also lowers PKA enzymes in the body which unleash the ability to form new stem cells. 
• Fasting induces detoxifying enzyme pathways. This helps detoxification processes to continue even after fasting has been discontinued. 
• Fasting helps kill cancer cells by building immunity. The 2018 Nobel prize was awarded to Dr.Honzo  for research on this subject. 
• Fasting not only slows the aging process but also reverses aging. 

FOUR PHASES OF FASTING 
Fasting is a four phase process. 
(1) In the first phase your body slows down the metabolic rate and the activity level. You develop headache and experience withdrawal symptoms. 
(2) In phase two of fasting Glucogon increases which helps burn fat. Your metabolic rate increases and brain releases Alpha waves which encourage relaxation, induce a profound feeling of mental clarity and help achieve an alert state of mind. This is your brain’s way of telling you to get up and search for food. 
(3) In third phase autophagy starts and it helps clean out the dead and damaged cells.
(4) The fourth stage is during the end of fast and when food is reintroduced. It is called the re-feeding stage. At this stage the growth in new cell’s happens. It is a very important stage for rejuvenation. 

There are two different approaches to fasting; intermittent and prolonged. 

1. INTERMITTENT FASTING
In Intermittent Fasting one either reduces the eating window to a narrow window of 10 hours or less every day or does 24 hour fasts with caloric reduction (to under 500 calories) twice a week. We have already covered IF in detail under a separate heading. 

2. PROLONGED FASTING
In Prolonged Fasting the fasting period is stretched beyond 24 hours. On the surface it appears difficult but it really isn’t because one has already gone past the tough period of the first 24 hours. Prolonged fasting has tremendous therapeutic value. In fact it is believed that when all else fails, prolonged fasting is the treatment of last resort. It has been practiced in a few countries including Russia for many years. In California there is a clinic in Santa Rosa called “True North Health Center” where they put patients on supervised water fasts for up to 40 days. I have met the director Dr. Alan Goldhamer. They have been quite successful and work closely with Dr. John McDougall of the PBWF movement. 
During prolonged fasting one must follow these suggestions:
- Add a pinch of Himalayan salt to your water.
- Do not stress out. 
- Do whatever soothes you. Meditation can help. 
- Stay physically active and follow your typical daily regimen.

Prolonged fasting can be done in different ways with varying level of intensity:

A. Liquid Fast: 
In this you can consume water and clear liquid foods like juice and soups. This is truly not a fast but just a detox program. 

B. Fruits Only Fast: 
In this, you water fast for 24 hours and then break your fast with a meal of fruits only. Many Indian religious fasts come under this category, where on the fasting day you skip breakfast and lunch and only eat dinner but that dinner is fruits only; no cereals or beans or starchy vegetables. 

C. Water Fast: 
No food but plenty of water for 24 hours or longer. This fast can be done for long periods and is very therapeutic. The longest water only fast on record is 382 days. 

D. Dry Fast: 
No food or water for 24 hours or longer. It is the most effective way to fast. It is two to three times more effective than water fasting. There are two types of dry fasts; soft and hard. In soft dry fast you can brush your teeth, shower and wash your hands. In hard dry fast you avoid any contact with water. 

How to break a Fast:
When breaking a fast, care should be taken to introduce food slowly. Break your fast with water, juice, fruits and a small meal, in that order. 
Those who are doing dry fasting should bracket their dry fast with water fasting on both ends. A 48 hour dry fast can be bracketed with two 12 hour water fasts making it a 72 hour fast which is as effective as a five day water only fast. This is my personal favorite. 

Extended fasting should be practiced slowly. Those who have been doing intermittent fasting will find it easy to extend fasting window to 24 hrs by skipping breakfast and lunch and eating dinner at the regular time. 
Once you are able to do 24 hr. fast comfortably, you can skip the dinner also and eat at your regular time, breakfast or brunch (whatever is your daily routine). This way you would achieve  40 hrs fast. After that the next step would be to go for 48 hrs, 64 hrs and 72 hrs. I advise against keeping any fast longer than 72 hrs without supervision. 
When you are doing water only fast you would be urinating a lot and it is recommended to add some Himalayan salt to your water. That salt helps maintain the mineral balance. 
People who are suffering serious illnesses should consult their physicians before starting the practice of fasting. 

When we fast for therapeutic purposes and not for weight loss, the goal is to achieve autophagy which starts when body runs out of protein and it also typically starts after 24 hours. Fruits such as apple are the lowest in protein (only 2%). So if the fast is broken by fruits low in protein, even while breaking the fast in the evening the autophagy is maintained for another 12-16 hours till next day’s breakfast.

The most striking study on prolonged fasting is one done in Russia by Dr. Perfecta Y. S. Nicholaia,
120 mice were split into 4 group of 30 each. Each group was inoculated with Sarcoma. 
• Group-1 before starting dry fast, 
• Group-2 during dry fast,
• Group-3 upon termination of dry fast and 
• Group-4 was control group which did not fast. 

The survival rates in these groups were as following:
Group-1:    50%
Group-2:   66%
Group-3: 100%
Group-4:     0%
[10/17/25, 8:06:59 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •• 8 Stages of Fasting ••

Every cell in the human body is genetically programmed for two main functions (1) self preservation and (2) procreation. 
During plenty of food (fed state), it is less worried about preservation and it is preoccupied with procreation. It is very similar to human behavior; which truly is just the composite of 30 trillion cell’s behavior. During shortage of food body’s focus shifts to preservation. 

The first thing to run out is sugar which is stored as glycogen in muscles and liver. The total storage capacity is 500 grams (2,000 calories), 100 in liver and 400 in muscles. This usually takes about 12 hours to exhaust. When body runs out of sugar in liver, it starts to convert fat into ketone bodies to provide energy to the brain. This stage is called ketosis. The body can stay in ketosis for a very long time and the longest record for water fasting is 382 days. 

When body runs out of protein, it begins to recycle the waste protein sitting inside each cell’s trash can (lysosome) and recycles it into amino acids (which are the building blocks of protein). After some time the body begins to recycle the dead and damaged cells for protein. The process also extends to Senescent cells which are not quite dead but have stopped reproducing. 

The body goes through various stages; some of which are a step curve as in intermittent fasting but others lie on a continuum. Also, when a stage is triggered, is a function of meal (or two) before you start fasting. If the last meal was low in carbs the metabolic shift to ketosis would happen sooner. If the last meal was low in protein the autophagy would trigger earlier. 

The following describes the various stages human body goes through while fasting. The gap in hours is only an approximation as actual would vary from individual to individual, depending upon their gut microbiome and content of the meals prior to fasting. 

(1) 12 hrs: Ketosis: As glycogen in the liver is exhausted, the metabolic pathway shifts to fat burning mode called Ketosis. During ketosis the fat from fat cells is released to provide fuel for the body, as liver converts these fat cells into ketone bodies to provide energy to the brain. During this stage the metabolic rate increases as if body is nudging you to go find food. This is what is typically achieved during daily Intermittent fasting. The higher metabolic rate helps lose excess fat. 

(2) 18 hrs: As ketone bodies level in the blood rises, it signals the body to ramp up stress busting pathways to reduce inflammation and repair DNA damage. 

(3) 24 hrs: Autophagy (Intracellular): At 24 hours cells start recycling protein waste kept in a trash container inside every cell (called lysosome).

(4) 36 hrs: Autophagy (Intercellular): As further time passes the body also begins to recycle damaged cells like senescent cells and misfolded proteins.

(5) 48 hrs: Growth Hormones reach the highest levels (almost 5 times as high as before the fast). This is because hunger hormone Ghrelin promotes the growth hormone secretion.

(6) 54 hrs: Insulin levels drop to the lowest point. The body becomes more insulin sensitive.

(7) 72 hrs: Breakdown of old immune cells and generation  of new ones. Helps build cancer immunity. During this stage (as per Dr. Valter Longo of USC) cancer cells are weakened and more susceptible to chemotherapy while normal cells become more resistant to chemo therapy. 

(8) Refeeding Stage: This stage is very important and often misunderstood. The refeeding should be done slowly and some suggest that food should be gradually increased to normal levels over a duration half as long as the fasting period. More research is needed in this area as human studies to date are quite limited. 

When human body is deprived of Autophagy by staying for ever in fed state, the neurons cells in the brain get damaged causing neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer’s and others. It is for these reasons the experts like Dr. Tasuku Honzo and Dr. James P. Allison recommend that one should do a 10 day prolonged fast each year. It does not have to be water only fast; one can eat one meal a day of under 500 calories. It helps if the meals are light on protein as protein deficiency is the main cause of therapeutic benefits. It so happens that there is a custom in many cultures to observe such fasts. Navratri among Hindus and Ramdan among Muslims. Unfortunately to avoid discomfort people have started making too many concessions which negate the benefits of such fasts.
[10/17/25, 8:07:01 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• NAVRATRI FAST •••

In most cultures it is believed that there are demons (negative tendencies) within us which make us do the wrong and evil. Navratri is the nine days period when we fight and defeat these demons within us. Exemplified in victory of Ram over 10 headed Ravan or 9 visits by Mother Durga to our homes to kill these demons within us. Dash-hara means to concur the 10 (demons). Our ancestors had beautifully tied the wisdom of their knowledge through religious strings to increase compliance.

The modern science is only catching up to what our ancestors knew intuitively. It was only in year 2016 and 2018 that Nobel prizes were awarded to scientists who demonstrated how and why fasting is so therapeutic. First a note about the demons we are trying to eliminate:

1. Ahankar: Ego, Pride
2. Kam (Vasana): Lust
3. Krodh: Wrath, Anger
4. Mada: Stubbornly 
5. Lobha: Greed, Selfishness
6. Moha: Attachment, Delusion 
7. Amanavta: Inhumane Behavior, Cruelty 
8. Anyaya: Injustice 
9. Matsara: Envy (Jealousy)
10. Swarth: Moha: Attachment, Delusion  
11. Sloth: Laziness 
12. Gluttony

The list varies slightly from culture to culture but the idea is the same. Fasting achieves it very well and in various ways by rejuvenating body, mind and intellect. 

One’s main goal during Navratri fast is to to create a caloric deficiency and protein deficiency for an extended period of time so that the body can derive the benefits of autophagy and cleans itself of waste protein, misfolded proteins, damaged cells, dead cells and senescent cells. Ideally the fast should be done without any food as it is practiced among Jains called Paryushan  8-Day fast. But that is a bit more difficult for most people to follow. Here are the guidelines for meal during Navratri fasting. 

1. One meal a day (OMAD) only. Have it in the early evening. 
2. The total calories should be 500 or less. 
3. During fasting window of 23 hours consume only water. Avoid any tea or coffee or any other beverages. Take any beverage only during the eating window of one hour including coconut water. 
4. Avoid food which are rich in protein (as a % of total calories). 
5. Avoid foods from the grains and legumes groups as they are rich in protein. 
6. Predominantly eat from fruits and vegetable groups. Their caloric density is low, so they fill up stomach without exceeding total calories. 
7. Within the fruits and vegetables group look for foods which are low in protein. For example apples are better than guavas. 
8. Nuts and Seeds group is okay but in smaller quantities. Have a spoon of flax, Chia or hemp seed to ensure you get your omega-3. 

In this process of Navratri fast, you will lose some weight but that is not the primary purpose of Navratri fast. If weight loss bothers you, you can gain it right back upon completion of the 9 day fast by going back to regular diet.
[10/17/25, 8:07:02 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • NAVRATRI Meal Plan •

Here is an example of a recommended meal plan for Navratre fasts. 

1.  Non starchy Veggies: 8 oz (50 cal)
2. Low protein fruits: 4 oz (75 cal) 
3. Starchy Veggies: 3 oz (90)
4. Tapioca: 2 oz (200) 
5. Peanuts: 1/4 oz (40) 
6. Flaxseed: 1 tsp (25) 
7. Vegetable stock & spices (20)

Total Calories = 500
Total Protein = less than 3%
Add spices generously
———————————
Replacing Tapioca with 
- Chestnut Flour 2 oz (205 calories) or 
- Barnyard Millet 2.5 oz (210 calories) 
adds another 2-3% protein.

———————————
•Chestnut Flour is second best choice after Tapioca. It has 5.4% protein. 

•Barnyard Millet is okay. It has 8% protein. It is also 
called Sama ka Rice

•Amaranth is not recommended as it has 15% protein which is worse that regular rice or wheat.

[10/17/25, 8:07:06 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •COFFEE DURING FAST?•

An often asked question is whether drinking black coffee is okay during fasting periods. Many doctors do allow black coffee and I also have in the past allowed this exception. Part of the reason is that people are so dependent on coffee for their bowl movement that without it they can’t extend their eating window for proper adherence to 16:8 intermittent fasting. Also caffeine addiction causes headache withdrawal symptom making it difficult to fast. I want to address this issue today and revise my recommendation. 
Drinking coffee empty stomach is not a good idea as it can cause many problems. Here are some explanations:
(1) Even though black coffee doesn’t have any calories and should not interrupt ketosis during fasting window, it does reset the circadian clock. So for daily 16:8 intermittent fasting it should not be consumed during fasting window. 
(2) One objective of fasting is to provide complete rest to the digestive system and secretive glands. Drinking coffee interrupts this and gets the glands to secrete hormones and digestive fluids. If causes liver to release sugar. These disrupt the rejuvenation process. It is also true with the consumption of other additives like lemon juice, apple cider vinegar, Methi seeds, Amla extract etc. I suggest you avoid adding anything to your water during fasts. 
(3) Stomach has hydrochloric acid which helps digest food. Drinking coffee empty stomach increases acidity. This can lead to heartburn, acid reflux, irritable bowl syndrome and stomach ulcers. 
(4) Caffeine on empty stomach releases cortisol and adrenal hormones raising heart rate and blood pressure. This gives signal to liver to release blood sugar to assist in fight or flight response. This is the reason you feel perked up, but in the long run it is unhealthy as it interferes with your natural circadian rhythm. 
(5) Caffeine in Coffee leads to anxiety because you lower your brain’s power to properly breakdown serotonin which is the hormone that keeps you calm and  happy. It can also lead to depression. 
(6) Reduced serotonin production can affect sleep because body changes serotonin into melatonin at night. This is why coffee impacts one’s ability to sleep at night. 
(7) Coffee is diuretic and increases the amount of fluid the body passes which can lead to dehydration. 

For all these reasons it is advisable to drink coffee during your eating window with breakfast or lunch. One should avoid coffee after 4:00 PM as it has a half life of 6 hours and it might affect your sleep. Most things discussed in this post also apply to tea but to a somewhat lower extent. 

PLEASE AVOID COFFEE DURING ALL FASTS AND DAILY FASTING WINDOW.
[10/17/25, 8:07:07 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •RAMADAN FASTING•

In Ramadan fast practiced by Muslims all over the world, for a period of 28 days, one takes a meal just before the sunrise and fasts during the day not consuming even the water. Then after sunset they take their second meal. The gap between the meals is about 12 hours. 

A Fasting Study at UC SanDiego 
demonstrated that intermittent fasting similar to Ramadan fasting changes proteome signature in human body by changing gene expression, lowering proteins associated with chronic diseases like diabetes, hypertension, cancer, Alzheimer’s, metabolic syndrome and bipolar disease and depression.
[10/18/25, 7:10:06 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •3rd Pillar of Health•
CIRCADIAN  RHYTHM

The third pillar of health is maintaining our circadian rhythm in sync with the day and night cycle of nature. The timing of our daily activities like eating, exercising, spending time outdoors, and sleeping plays a key role in our well-being. All mammals, including humans, evolved on a 24-hour day/night cycle. This has led to the creation of an internal clock in each cell that dictates the essential functions and processes of that cell during the daily 24-hour cycle. These are called circadian rhythms, and they play a key role in various aspects of physical and mental health. The word "circadian" comes from the Latin phrase “circa diem,” which means “around a day.” Circadian rhythms exist in most living organisms, including plants, helping them breathe in CO2 during the day and oxygen at night. In humans, circadian rhythms coordinate mental and physical systems throughout the body. The digestive system produces proteins to match the typical timing of meals, and the endocrine system regulates hormones to suit normal energy expenditure. Circadian rhythms ensure that the body’s processes are optimized at various points during a 24-hour period.

It is important to note that the term "biological clock," although often used interchangeably with circadian rhythm, is not the same. Biological clocks help regulate the timing of bodily processes, including circadian rhythms. A circadian rhythm is an effect of a biological clock, but not all biological clocks are circadian. Some operate on lunar or seasonal cycles.

Cortisol & Melatonin
Two important hormones released by the body are cortisol and melatonin. Cortisol is released in the morning, with its levels rising with sunrise and staying high until sunset. It is called the "get up and go" hormone as it promotes activity. Melatonin rises after sunset and stays high throughout the night. It is a hormone that slows us down and prepares us for the sleep cycle. These two hormones counteract each other and determine our circadian rhythm.

How Does Circadian Rhythm Work?
The circadian rhythms throughout the body are connected to a master clock, sometimes referred to as the circadian pacemaker, located in a part of the brain called the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus. At different times of the day, clock genes in the SCN send signals to regulate activity throughout the body. Various systems of the body synchronize with this master clock. The master clock synchronizes itself to nature’s clock via multiple mechanisms that we have only recently begun to understand.

The SCN is highly sensitive to light, which serves as a critical external cue that influences the signals sent by the SCN to coordinate internal clocks in the body. For this reason, circadian rhythms are closely connected to day and night. Other cues, like food intake, exercise, social activity, and temperature, can affect the master clock. Light has the most powerful influence on circadian rhythms.

Melanopsin Protein
There is a protein called melanopsin, discovered less than 20 years ago, which has a light-sensing mechanism and is present only in about 5,000 neurons of each eye. These neurons are hardwired to the master clock in the brain. Through these cells, we perceive daylight and adjust our master clock in the brain.

In 2017, Nobel laureates Jeffrey C. Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael W. Young discovered how plants, animals, and humans adapt their biological rhythms to synchronize with the Earth’s rotations. They isolated a gene called "Period" that controls the normal daily biological rhythm. They showed that this gene encodes a protein called Per that accumulates in the cell during the night and degrades during the day. There is also a gene called "Timeless" which makes a protein called Tim during daytime, that combines with Per to enter the nucleus of the cell and help maintain the cycle.

Our inner clock adapts our physiology not only to the dramatically different phases of day and night but also to the various phases within day and night. Many of our genes are regulated by the biological clock, and a carefully calibrated circadian rhythm adapts our physiology to the different phases of the day. The clock regulates various functions like hormone levels, sleep, body temperature, metabolism, and even behavior.

Our health is affected when there is a temporary mismatch between the external clock and this internal biological clock, as in the case of jet lag. When this misalignment becomes chronic, it can lead to chronic diseases. In recent years, circadian biology has developed into a separate research field, with implications for our health and wellness. Besides daylight, other external factors that affect the master clock include:

1. Sleep Patten
One of the most important and well-known circadian rhythms is the sleep-wake cycle. When properly aligned, a circadian rhythm can promote consistent and restorative sleep. But when this circadian rhythm is out of sync, it can create significant sleeping problems, including insomnia.

2. Blue Light Exposure:
The screens used for TV, computer monitors, and cell phones emit blue light and create confusion in the circadian rhythm, making the body think it may still be daytime. It is therefore important to attach a blue light filter to these devices or switch them off at least an hour before bedtime. Most cell phones have this filter built-in and should be set to turn on automatically at night.

3. Meal Time:
After society’s adoption of artificial light in the last 150 years, we have changed our eating habits, delayed meal times, and added late-night snacking. This is another factor that confuses our body, making it think it is still daytime.

4. Physical Activity:
Our body is programmed to engage in physical activity during the daytime, so when we go to the gym and work out after dark, the body gets conflicting signals.

5. Temperature: 
Our body is programmed to expect cooler temperatures at night, so artificial heating at night can also upset the circadian rhythm. It is therefore recommended to set lower temperatures at night.

Studies by Dr. Sachin Panda of the Salk Indtitute (affiliated with University of California, San Diego) have shown that when we correct our circadian rhythm our body recovers significantly. 
 
As you can see, many of the behaviors that we have modified in the last 150 years, after the development of the electric grid, upset our circadian rhythm and have contributed to the growth of chronic diseases. It is only in the last 15 years that we have paid attention to this field. When we change our lifestyle to align it with our circadian rhythm, the results are remarkable, irrespective of the food we consume. Changes in diet, when combined with circadian rhythm harmony, lead to wonders.

[10/18/25, 7:10:07 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •SLEEP: Why it Matters?

Nearly two out of three people in the U.S. don’t get sufficient sleep, significantly impacting their health. One-third of people sleep six hours or less, double the rate from 50 years ago. The CDC recognizes this as a public health epidemic, with an estimated 60 million Americans suffering from chronic sleep disorders. Children are progressively getting less sleep, averaging two hours less per night compared to a century ago. One in five car crashes in the U.S. is caused by drowsy driving. Here’s what we know about sleep:

Why Do We Sleep?
1. Brain Maintenance:
The brain, which consumes 25% of the body’s energy, produces metabolic waste that must be removed. Cerebral spinal fluid flushes out waste like beta-amyloids during deep sleep. Accumulation of these wastes can lead to diseases like dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Besides removing toxins during sleep the brain repairs brain cells, prunes connections, and transfers short-term memory into long-term memory. It also integrates daily learning, especially perceptual learning, with prior experiences.

2.Energy Replenishment:
Sleep replenishes energy sources. Tiredness builds up Adenosine levels in the brain leading to involuntary sleep, which is dangerous while driving. Caffeine temporarily blocks this signal but does not prevent it.

3.Cognitive Function:
Lack of sleep impairs concentration, logical thinking, memory, focus, attention, and alertness. It also triples reaction times, contributing to auto accidents.

4.Health Impact:
Sleep affects the cardiovascular system, including heart function and blood pressure. Sleep deprivation is linked to high BP, weakened immune systems, increased infections, and cancer progression.

5.Appetite Regulation:
Sleep deprivation disrupts appetite regulation, leading to overeating and increased obesity. 

6.Increased Insulin Resistance:
It also makes insulin less effective, raising blood sugar levels, and contributing to type-2 diabetes. Sleep-deprived college students showed a 40% reduction in glucose clearance rates and a 30% decrease in insulin response. Fat cells from sleep-deprived people have poor glucose response.

7.Immunization Impact:
Sleep deprivation reduces vaccination benefits. In a study, one night of sleep deprivation after Hepatitis vaccination resulted in 49% reduction in HPAV antibodies after 4 weeks. 

8.Emotional Health:
Sleep deprivation is linked to increased anxiety, depression, and volatile behavior. It is also associated with ADHD in children and marital discord due to a tendency to remember negative words more than positive ones. One in five high school boys in the US is diagnosed with ADHD. Studies show that sleep deprived people are twice as likely to remember negative words than positive words. This explains some of the marital discords. 

9.Circadian Rhythm:
Both sleep deficits and misalignment of circadian rhythm contribute to health problems. Sleep apnea increases the risk of cardiovascular disease by 420%, and sleeping less than six hours a night raises stroke risk by 4.5 times. A rare sleep disorder called Fatal Familial Insomnia leads to dementia and death. 

10.Miscellaneous:
Heavy physical labor does not require extra sleep, while emotional stress may. Activities that increase core body temperature, like exercise or a hot bath, can facilitate sleep. Waking during the night is common and not necessarily indicative of disturbed sleep. Those who can "sleep anywhere anytime" are likely sleep deprived. 

HOW MUCH SLEEP?
A typical adult needs 7-9 hours of sleep and an adolescent needs 8-10 hours of sleep. Children need more. There are personal differences, but no adult needs less than 6 hours and any claims to the contrary are only reflection of their ignorance. Adverse effects to sleeping less are well understood but are there adverse health effects of sleeping too much? Over sleeping is not natural. Sleeping over 10 hours a night is abnormal. Studies have shown that subjects who were asked to sleep 14 hours at night could not sleep that much after the first few days. Once they have made up for a sleep deficit, it is not possible to sleep more and accumulate a surplus. Many people who claim to need less sleep, when brought under a controlled study, are surprised to find how their sleep duration expanded when the light and clocks are removed from their environment. 

Sleep Deficiency
Health consequences of sleep deficiency include following:
- Higher Inflammation
- Weight Gain & Obesity
- Diabetes Risk
- Cardio Vascular Disease
- Cancer Risk 
- Reduced Immunity
- Hormonal ImbalanceLack of Concentration 
- Hyperactivity
- Emotional Instability
- Depression & Burnout

NAPPING
1. Napping is very beneficial and it can help make up for sleep deficit at night. Hour for hour it is just as effective as sleep at night. However it does not help remove any circadian rhythm imbalances. 
2. When it comes to memory processing, a 90 minute nap is as beneficial as a 6 hour sleep at night. However we don’t have data for immune function, endocrine function, hormonal function, clearance of toxins etc. 
3. A good time to nap is early afternoon and not late afternoon. 
4. If a person wakes up naturally at the time they need to wake up, they probably get enough sleep. Do they sleep longer on the weekends ? If so, they likely don’t get enough sleep during the week. 

SLEEP DISORDERS 
Here are some common sleep disorders. 

(1) Insomnia:
This refers to difficulty in falling asleep. There can be many causes like
- Acute stress
- Alcohol or caffeine 
- Circadian imbalance
- Medical or neurological factors 
- Psychiatric disorders

(2) Parasomnia:
This refers to unusual behavior at night.
- Non REM Parasomnia like sleep walking or nightmares.
- REM Sleep Behavior Disorders

(3) Hypersomnia:
Excessive Daytime Sleeping
can be due to any of the following major causes:
- Insufficient quantity of sleep at night
- Poor quality of sleep
- Sleep Apnea
- Pathological disorders like Narcolepsy and Idiopathic Insomnia. 
- Medical or Psychiatric disorders like thyroid condition, cancer, medication side effects or mood disorders
- Circadian Rhythm disorders like night shift job and jet lag.

(4) Sleep Apnea:
This is a sleep related breathing disorder. With this condition, people snore very loudly and stop breathing in the middle of their sleep.

(5)  Restless Leg Syndrome: 
This is classified as a sleep related movement disorder and involves periodic limb movement. 

CAUSES OF SLEEP DISORDERS
1. Melatonin deficiency
2. Caffeine and/or alcohol
3. Watching blue light emitting screens like TV, computer and cell phones before bedtime
4. Eating late dinners after it is dark outside
5. Snacking after dinner
6. Bright light and warm temperature
7. Erratic timing of sleep

As you can see there are many sleep disorders some are clearly due to diet and lifestyle but all may not be. If these persist even after making modifications in diet and lifestyle, one should consult a specialist.

MELATONIN  
Melatonin, a hormone produced in the pineal gland and enterochromaffin cells in the gut, is typically released after sunset. Traditionally known as a sleep hormone, recent research reveals its broader roles, especially in the body's rejuvenation.

There are two types of melatonin: circulating melatonin, produced by the pineal gland and stimulated by darkness, and subcellular melatonin, found in mitochondria and protecting against oxidation and free radical damage. Subcellular melatonin is now considered primary, with pineal gland melatonin as a backup. Insufficient melatonin can disrupt sleep, increase inflammation, and reduce antioxidant protection, impacting conditions like hypertension, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Melatonin deficiency is linked to Sundown Syndrome in dementia and Alzheimer’s patients, characterized by agitation and fatigue at sunset.

Melatonin production is stimulated by darkness and infrared light but inhibited by brightness and blue light. Near-infrared (NIR) waves from the sun, comprising about 50% of solar energy, are major stimulants of subcellular melatonin. Historically, infrared exposure came from wooden fires, now replaced by fluorescent lights, which lack this benefit. Clouds and grass reflect infrared rays, making outdoor exposure beneficial even without direct sunlight.

Besides its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, melatonin offers numerous benefits:
1. Modulates the immune system and is effective against certain viruses.
2. Is neuroprotective, aiding memory and reducing anxiety and depression.
3. Controls the release of reproductive hormones in men and women.
4. Has cardioprotective qualities, lowering blood pressure and improving cholesterol profiles.
5. Plays a crucial role in insulin production and action, regulating GLUT4 expression, and reducing insulin resistance.
6. Lower melatonin levels are linked to higher incidences of breast and prostate cancers.

As melatonin production decreases with age, dietary sources become important. I do not advise taking melatonin supplements. Melatonin was discovered in plant foods in 1995, with rich sources including pistachios, cranberries, mushrooms, cherries, and walnuts. Consuming just two pistachios a day can suffice. A date-pistachio roll is a recommended dessert after dinner to boost melatonin intake.

I am pleased to share with you the news that New York City has decided to train its doctors in a plant based nutrition training beginning next year. This is the first of its kind program in the Western World. 
This will allow doctors to, where appropriate, suggest a switch to animal-free foods for potential health gains for their patients.

[10/19/25, 7:33:57 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: 4th Pillar of Health: PHYSICAL ACTIVITY

The fourth pillar of health is physical activity. Throughout evolution, we needed to walk in search of food and sometimes run to catch a prey or defend ourselves. As a result, our bodies have evolved to depend on mostly moderate physical activity, with occasional strenuous exertion. In modern times, with an abundance of food, these activities are no longer necessary for survival, but they remain crucial for maintaining optimal bodily function. An inactive lifestyle ranks as the fifth leading risk factor for death and the sixth for disability. Dietary risks and smoking are the top two factors for both these risks.

Diet is the 800-pound gorilla in the room when it comes to health. However, after diet, detoxification, and circadian rhythm, physical activity is the fourth most important factor for good health. Most people are aware of the importance of exercise. My goal in this blog is to cover some basic minimum activities and exercises essential for good health.

Why Exercise
Besides its benefits to physical health, exercise positively impacts mental health, cognitive function, sleep quality, cancer prevention, diabetes management, cardiovascular disease (CVD), immune function, blood pressure, and lifespan. Outlined below are some major benefits. 

Cardiac Health
The most common focus of exercise is on cardiac health. Research shows that the more you walk, the lower your all-cause mortality rate. Walking for 90 minutes a day is better than walking for 60 minutes, which is better than walking for 30 minutes. The speed of walking is important for cardiac workouts. I recommend a pace of 100-130 steps per minute, though this will vary depending on one’s age. The body should reach a stress level of about 85% of its maximum capacity for some duration during the day. To compute your maximum pulse capacity, subtract your age from 220. For example, a 60-year-old would have a maximum pulse rate of 160. The goal should be to reach 85% of that maximum—136 beats per minute—for at least 5 minutes twice daily.

Lymphatic Health
The lymphatic system is the body’s janitorial system, collecting and disposing of waste throughout the body. Unfortunately, this benefit of walking is often neglected by most authors. Our lymphatic system does not have a pump, so walking facilitates the flow of lymphatic fluids from our lymph nodes, located near our underarms and upper leg joints. For this benefit, it’s not necessary to climb up the stairs; climbing down is equally effective.

Vertebrae Health
Certain parts of the body, like the intervertebral discs (IVDs) separating our backbones, lack blood vessels. The only way they get nutrition and excrete waste is through a spongy process—when they’re compressed, waste is excreted, and when they expand, fresh nutrients are absorbed from the bones above and below. This cycle repeats with every step we take. Many media articles questioning the wisdom of 10,000 steps a day miss this critical point.

Other Benefits
Walking also offers many other benefits, including:
- Aiding in weight loss
- Reducing the risk of lifestyle diseases like diabetes, stroke, and varicose veins
- Increasing lung capacity
- Improving mood
- Boosting immunity
- Preventing disability in old age
- Speeding up digestion

How Much Exercise
The question then arises: how much exercise is ideal? The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, issued by the U.S. government, recommend 150-300 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise per week. This is consistent with previous guidelines advising at least 30 minutes per day. However, these advisories often suffer from a mindset of, “Why advise something that won’t be followed?” As a result, they tone down their recommendations to what they think is achievable rather than informing us of what the science says—this is also common with dietary guidelines.

A good rule of thumb is to spend 10% of your waking time in movement. This amounts to about 100 minutes a day or approximately 10,000 steps. Ideally, this should be spread throughout the day, and the best way to monitor this is by using a Fitbit or Apple Watch.

While some activities have benefits that lie on a continuum, it helps to pick a number to emphasize the point. Walking is one such activity. It is well established that the more you walk each day, the better it is for your health. Of course, extremes are bad, and the law of diminishing returns applies to all activities. Research has shown that walking for one hour per day is better than walking for half an hour, which is better than 20 minutes, and even that is better than no walking at all. Studies also indicate that walking for an hour and a half each day is better than one hour. There is no research beyond that. Separately, research has shown that walking for five minutes each waking hour is a good target for activity levels. Studies of various Blue Zones, where people live the longest and healthiest lives, have shown that the average number of daily steps people walk in these areas is over 13,000. The figure of 10,000 is just a marker to be used as a guide.

Types of Activity
The goal should be to stay physically active during waking hours. There are many types of physical activities, such as walking, jogging, running, climbing stairs, cycling, swimming, stationary running, skipping rope, yoga asanas, pranayama, and more. Playing sports is also a great way to stay active and provides mental relaxation.

Vertebrae Movement 
Besides walking, it’s important to move your vertebrae to exercise the muscles that hold your back in place. Some exercises for the back should cover all four types of movements:
- Forward and backward bending
- Side bending to the left and right
- Twisting in both directions
- Compression and extension
Yoga is the best way to exercise these muscles. 

Strength Training
Strength training is important for muscle and bone health. Many freehand exercises, like pushups, sit-ups, pull-ups, and squats, can help. Going to the gym is also a good idea for those who have time. However, excessive exercises like HIIT should be avoided.

Yog Asanas
Practicing yoga asanas is very healthy for the body. Besides providing flexibility and strength, it also stimulates various internal organs and reduces visceral fat

Pranayama 
The practice of pranayama can significantly improve and maintain health. The role of breathing patterns in health recovery is only now being recognized in the Western world, as demonstrated by the 2019 Nobel Prize in Physiology for research on how human cells respond to different levels of oxygen.

10K Walk In Tight Spaces
In extreme weather conditions, covering 10,000 steps each day can be challenging. However, there is a way to achieve this in tight spaces by walking in a figure-eight pattern as shown in the diagram below. 

To summarize, an active lifestyle is key to good health, and it’s best to establish a routine that can be followed regularly

[10/20/25, 6:55:54 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Pillar 5:  EMOTIONAL & SPIRITUAL HEALTH

The fifth pillar of health is Emotional & Spiritual Health. The pursuit of happiness is a fundamental drive shared by all living organisms, from single cells to the largest blue whales. For over a century, it was believed that happiness was experienced primarily at the brain level, leading to the development of psychology as a field to understand mental malfunctions. However, recent research has shown that this is not entirely true; every cell in the human body seeks happiness and compensates under conditions of adversity.

5.1 Emotional Health
We’ve all heard stories about positive thinking and mind over matter. Every cell in our body is a living organism that behaves as if it has a mind of its own. The 2017 Nobel Prize in Physiology was awarded to J.C. Hall, M. Rosbash, and M.W. Young for their research on how our circadian clock functions at the cellular level. The 2019 Nobel Prize was given to W.G. Kaelin, G.L. Semenza, and P.J. Ratcliffe for their work demonstrating how cells respond to the level of oxygen in our blood.

Hormones play a crucial role in determining our emotional health, while emotions influence the functioning of our endocrine glands, which release hormones. This interdependence significantly impacts our health, and science has only just begun to scratch the surface of understanding it. There is still much more to learn.

Placebo and Nocebo Effects
The placebo effect has been known for over a century, and the entire field of homeopathy relies on it. "Placebo" in Latin means “I shall be acceptable or pleasing.” When we take a pill believing it to be medicine, we can experience healing, even if the pill is just sugar. Clearly, it is not the sugar that cures the illness but the conscious belief that healing will occur. The reverse of this is known as the nocebo effect, which has only recently garnered significant attention from researchers. "Nocebo" in Latin means “I shall cause harm.” Negative thoughts can be as powerful as positive ones in affecting our bodies, but in the opposite direction. If you believe something bad will happen, it’s quite likely that it will. The concept of a curse, or "shrap" in Hindu mythology, operates on this principle. Happy people tend to have happy thoughts, which lead to healthy bodies, while sorrow and self-pity often result in poor health.

Concept of Rasas
In our younger days, we learned about the concept of various rasas (moods) in Hindi literature:
1. Shanti: Peace
2. Bhakti: Devotion
3. Karuna: Pathos
4. Hasya: Laughter
5. Sringaar: Love, Romance, Beauty 
6. Veer: Courage and Bravery
7. Adbhut: Wonderment
8. Raudra: Anger
9. Bhayanak: Fear
10. Vibhatsya: Hatred

We now understand that these emotions impact the functioning of our hormonal glands, which release different hormones into the bloodstream, affecting our physical health. This is essentially what is meant by the power of positive and negative thinking.

Research Findings
It is widely accepted now that laughter is the best medicine. We’ve heard this time and again, but what we may not realize is that every single emotion has an impact on our body—every feeling has physical consequences. Here are some examples, all proven by various studies:

- When we are in love, even water tastes sweet. Love is also a potent painkiller and can improve memory.
- Anger leads to insomnia by increasing blood circulation to the lymph nodes and heart, which prevents sleep. It also results in high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, and a weakened immune system.
- Powerlessness makes everything feel heavy.
- Loneliness and sadness can make people feel cold, increase appetite, and lead to weight gain.
- Feeling offended can cause acne.
- Disgust can upset the stomach.
- A fit of giggles can reduce stress hormone levels.
- Laughter reduces the risk of heart attacks by lowering stress hormones.
- Jealousy, a mix of anger, stress, and fear, increases adrenaline levels increasing heart rate, and blood pressure while weakening the immune system.
- Crying expels stress chemicals (except those triggered by cutting onions). Suppressing tears can ruin digestion and weaken the immune system.
- Fear makes us pale by redirecting blood to the muscles for a fight-or-flight response.
- Praising your partner can lower cholesterol levels.
- Shame increases the stress hormone cortisol, which can constrict arteries and raise heart rate.
- Arguing produces more cytokines, which can slow down the healing process. High levels of cytokines can lead to cancer, heart disease, and arthritis.
- Short-term stress can strengthen the immune system and help fight cancer, but chronic stress can impair memory and lead to diabetes and heart disease.

Happiness Chemicals
There are four primary chemicals in our body that affect happiness: dopamine, oxytocin, serotonin, and endorphins.

Dopamine
This is the “feel-good” hormone, released when we eat desired food or engage in sex. However, it’s more accurate to say that dopamine is involved with anticipation rather than the actual feeling of happiness. It boosts mood, motivation, and attention and helps regulate emotional responses. It is often described as a striving emotion.

Oxytocin
This is the neurochemical that enables us to be social creatures. It fosters empathy, helping us feel close and bonded to others when released. Oxytocin is produced in the hypothalamus and stored in the pituitary gland.

Serotonin 
This is the hormone that helps regulate mood and social behavior, appetite and digestion, sleep, memory and sexual desire and function. A link is also suspected between serotonin and depression. Eighty percent of serotonin exists in the gut, and is governed by one’s state of hunger (yes, this is why you’re hungry).

Endorphins
These act as analgesics, reducing the perception of pain or discomfort. This explains their association with the “fight or flight” response. When pursuing happiness, endorphins help you “power through.” For example, they enable runners to push further and harder towards their goals.

Some of the natural ways  to boost Happiness hormones are:
* Listening to Music
* Eating Carbs
* Spending Time with loved ones
* Physical Exercise and Yoga
* Pranayama
* Meditation
* Prayers
* Helping others through social work
(I’ve let the secret out—now you know why I run these health blogs.)

Geeta’s Teachings
The entire discussion in the Geeta about the three types of personalities (gunas)—Satwic (purity), Rajsic (passion), and Tamsic (inertia)—makes sense. Chapter 14 of the Bhagavad Geeta is devoted to this subject. Similarly, in Ayurveda, people are classified into three main types: Vata, Pitta, and Kapha. Western medicine now recognizes that people can be divided into three types based on their gut microbiome. While these classifications are not identical, they illustrate that the differentiation among types of people is gaining acceptance. Our gut-brain connection is now well recognized, with the gut even being called the second brain.

Our diet and lifestyle affect the hormonal balance in our body, which in turn influences our psyche and actions. This concept is covered to some extent in all religious scriptures. I quote here verse 5 from Chapter 14 of the Geeta:

“Sattva (purity), Rajas (passion) and Tamas (inertia) - these gunas (qualities), O Arjun, are born of Prakrti (nature) and they bind the indestructible soul (consciousness within us) to the body”.

This is my favorite subject, and as you can see, I am passionate about it, having spent 14 years under the tutelage of Swami Chinmayananda.

[10/20/25, 6:55:56 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Pillar 5.2: SPIRITUAL HEALTH

The human pursuit to understand the nature of things has been eternal. Approximately 2,500 years ago, this quest for knowledge split into two disciplines: philosophy and science. At that time, India was the wealthiest country, and Takshshila was the world's largest university, attracting scholars from all over the world.

The credit given to Thales of Miletus as the father of modern science may be due to Western bias or the result of 1,000 years of oppression in India by invading cultures. Regardless, it is fascinating to note the convergence of modern science and Indian philosophy after 2,500 years. This topic was thoroughly explored by Fritjof Capra in his 1975 book, The Tao of Physics: An Exploration of the Parallels Between Modern Physics and Eastern Mysticism. I highly recommend it.

In matters of health and psychology, medical science is still trying to catch up with Ayurveda and the teachings of the Upanishads and Geeta. If it weren't for the greed of the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, we might have seen the light many decades ago.

The power of prayer has also gained acceptance within the scientific community. That you pray is important; who you pray to is irrelevant. What matters is that your mind becomes flooded with a sense of reverence and gratitude. Feelings of gratitude trigger the release of the oxytocin hormone which decreases blood pressure, strengthens the immune system, and speeds up the body's healing processes. To illustrate this point, I will share my favorite couplet from Sant Kabir:

“Dukh me sumiran sab karen, Sukh me karen na koi , 
Jo sukh me sumirun kare, dukh kahe ko hoi.”

"Everyone prays when they are unhappy. 
No one prays when they are happy.  
Those who pray when they are happy 
Never experience unhappiness."

This verse is often misunderstood because we attribute *sukh* (happiness) to material gain, leading to disappointment when those material gains do not materialize. We often forget that we seek material gain only because we believe it will bring us happiness, and its absence will cause unhappiness. Happiness is our true goal. When we pray in the true spirit, seeking nothing but happiness, it comes to us naturally—like a five-year-old who, after feverishly chasing a butterfly, finds it gently resting on his hand once he sits down tired. 

My humble suggestion is that when you pray, never ask for material gains; simply ask that the results (outcomes) lead you to the path of happiness. Similarly, if you are blessing someone, wish for them to find happiness in whatever life has in store for them. Do not say, "May your wishes come true," because in their ignorance, they might wish for material gain, which may or may not bring them happiness.

When we pray with a sense of gratitude, the release of oxytocin in our body brings happiness. This creates a positive feedback loop, encouraging us to pursue this path more strongly. When we change our diet to a plant-based whole food (PBWF) approach, start intermittent fasting, and walk 10,000 steps a day, changes occur not only in our body but also in our psyche. Plant-based whole foods are what Krishna refers to as *Satvic* in the Geeta. Satvic foods bring forth Satvic thoughts, which are positive and promote happiness by releasing the “happiness hormones."

When we engage in action for the sake of action, without attachment to the outcome, the process of acting becomes joyful because there is no anxiety about the result. Whether we reach the target or not becomes secondary. When our sole focus is on achieving the target and we miss it, we feel disappointed and miserable, which negatively affects our health. This is the essence of the teachings of the Geeta, beautifully summarized in verse 2:47:

“कर्मण्ये वाधिका रस्ते मा फलेषु कदाचन। 
मा कर्म फल हेतु र्भूर्मा ते सङ्गोऽस्त्व कर्मणि॥
Karmanye vadhika raste, Ma phaleshu kadachana,
Ma karma phala hetur bhurma te sangotsva karmani”

“You have a right to work only, but never to any results thereof (fruits of action). You should never be motivated by the results of your actions, nor should you be attached to inaction (laziness).”

When it comes to our children, we often advise them, "Enjoy the game and play your best; it doesn’t matter whether you win or lose." Yet in our own lives, we often forget this advice.

Power of Concentration
A common question is: why should I meditate? Why should I spend 20 minutes each morning concentrating and thinking about nothing? This is a valid question for a newcomer who has not yet experienced the power of concentration. Professor Martin Seligman, the President of the American Psychological Association 25 years ago, raised a valid question: why are psychologists only studying psychotics, maladjusted people and not well-adjusted, happy people? His work focused on happy people, leading to the development of a new field of psychology called “Positive Psychology.” 

Another psychology professor, Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, conducted extensive research on this subject and interviewed many of the most successful people across various fields. He wrote a book titled Flow, named after a famous music composer who described a state of "flow" experienced while conducting a challenging symphony. In this state, he became so engrossed that he felt beyond his body, with his hands moving automatically. This book is worth reading, as it explains why deep concentration brings maximum happiness. Coming from Western scientists, this explanation adds validity to the experiences our ancestral masters must have felt when writing the Yoga Sutras, the Geeta and the Upanishads. In Patanjali’s Yoga Sutra, he discussed the eight limbs of yoga, with the sixth limb being *Dharana*, which means concentration. Deep concentration leads to meditation, and deep meditation leads to *Samadhi*, a state of bliss where one’s consciousness transcends the body.

In 1969, when I was at IIT Kanpur, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi came to give talks on Transcendental Meditation and initiated some of us who were interested. It had a profound effect on me and instilled a lifelong habit. Please watch the linked video summarizing some of the benefits of meditation. 👇

[10/20/25, 6:55:58 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: SPIRITUAL HEALTH: YOG

What is Yog (also written as Yoga) and how is it relevant in contemporary society? We will explore this topic in this blog post. 

Today, with the worldwide spread of Yog, it has become a generic term describing many pursuits ranging from simple physical exercises to an elaborate set of principles dictating how we live our lives. The sculptures of Mohenjodaro and Harappa are a testament to the practice of Yog 5,000 years ago. There are references to Yog in the Vedas, and, in fact, there are 20 Upanishads dedicated to it, 11 of which are in the Atharva Veda alone. The best known among them is the Yogatattva Upanishad from the Atharva Veda. In this Upanishad Vishnu states to Brahma that Yog is one, but there are various kinds in practice, the chief among these are of four types:

* Mantra Yog: The practice through chants.
* Laya Yog: Through deep concentration.
* Hatha Yog: Through exertion.
* Raja Yog: Through meditation. 

Some say Yog was first started by Shiva, while others credit Sage Kapil. Ved Vyas included Yog in the Bhagavad Gita, providing one of the broadest interpretations, where each chapter is described as a different Yog. Sage Patanjali’s *Yog Sutra* is widely recognized as the authoritative work on Yog. It also offers a broad interpretation of Yog, encompassing all aspects of one’s whole life. 

Hatha Yog is a narrower interpretation of Yog, focusing on body postures (Asanas), cleansing activities (Kriyas), and breathing exercises (Pranayama). In Yog literature, there are a number of reliable texts on Hatha Yoga, written between the 6th and 15th centuries AD. Four that stand out among them are:

1. *Hatha Yog Pradeepika* by Yogi Swatmarama
2. *Goraksha Samhita* by Yogi Gorakhnath
3. *Gheranda Samhita* by Sage Gheranda
4. *Hatharatnavali* by Srinivasbhatta Mahayogindra

Yog in the 20th century was revived by Krishnamacharya of Mysore, who was patronized by the King of Mysore about a century ago. His two disciples, B.K.S. Iyengar and Pattabhi Jois, played a key role in spreading Yog throughout the world.

Broadly, one can say that Hatha Yog, combined with Karma, Bhakti, and Jnana Yog disciplines, as preached in the Gita, prepares one to practice meditation. The triangle of the knower, the knowledge, and the known, once dissolved, is the ultimate state of being. Achieving this state is Yog.

The state of samadhi, achieved through yog and meditation, is not experienced by our sense organs, mind, or intellect, and is therefore indescribable in words. But one thing is certain, it must provide a very happy and peaceful experience; otherwise, why would one, after experiencing it, continue to return to it again and again?

The knowledge of the supreme self and ultimate reality (Brahman) is necessary but not sufficient to realize it. Experience is essential. The experience cannot be realized until we streamline our body, mind, and intellect through proper disciplines as expounded by Patanjali in his Yog Sutras: Yam, Niyam, Asan, Pranayam, Pratyahar, Dharna, Dhyan and Samadhi. In the Gita, the recommendation is similar but further classified by one’s aptitude (*gunas*) into Karma (action), Bhakti (devotion), and Jnana (knowledge). When a seeker who has achieved this balance in life (defined as *sthitaprajna* in the Gita as a person of steady wisdom) practices concentration (*dharana*), their meditation (*dhyana*) is successful, and they achieve samadhi.

The Yogatattva Upanishad declares that the realization of the supreme self is possible for the yog student who is free from "passion, anger, fear, delusion, greed, pride, lust, miserliness, swoon, giddiness, hunger, thirst, ambition, shame, fright, heart-burning, grief, and gladness."

It would not be inappropriate to say that following the five pillars of health as expounded in my blogs to-date helps one achieve this goal.

Another Perspective on Yog
Yog means to join. What are we trying to join? One way to look at ourselves is to realize that we are a bundle of body, mind and intellect (BMI). With the body, we perceive the world of objects around us; with the mind, we feel the world of emotions around us; and with the intellect, we think in the world of thoughts (ideologies) around us. So we, as the Perceiver, Feeler, Thinker (PFT) equipped with our BMI, are constantly seeking happiness in the world of Objects, Emotions, and Thoughts (OET) around us. Very often, these three pursuits for happiness are in conflict with each other. The body wants to pursue one thing, the mind another, and the intellect has a totally different agenda. 

For example, it is late at night, and you are watching a great movie on TV that you have been wanting to see for a very long time, but you have an important meeting the next morning at the office. The body is tired and wants to go to sleep, the mind wants to watch the movie, and the intellect is saying, “Don’t be ridiculous; you have an important meeting in the morning.” 

In our pursuit of happiness, we face such conflicts all the time—conflicts within our own body, mind, and intellect. In our teenage years, we mistakenly confuse physical attraction with love, or in adulthood, fall in love with a neighbor’s wife, knowing very well in our intellect that this is inappropriate and will lead to unhappy endings. 

Most smokers know that smoking is bad but cave into the body’s desire to smoke. The same goes for alcohol drinkers and those addicted to chocolate, cheese, or mithai. Thus, one goal towards happiness is to bring our own Body, Mind, and Intellect into sync so that internal conflicts disappear. THIS IS YOG.

Seeking Happiness
We all seek happiness, but interestingly enough, what we seek is different for each of us. One person seeks cigarettes while another hates cigarettes. As the scotch drinker walks through a duty free shop at an airport terminal, he is attracted to various scotches on display, but his wife has no interest in them and is drawn to the perfume counter where all the finest perfumes are displayed. Why is this so?

Our sages point out in our scriptures that this is because of our interactions in the earlier years of life. If, as a teenager, trying to belong to a clique of smokers, you cave into smoking, you develop that addiction. If the group you were exposed to consisted of alcohol drinkers, you develop an addiction to alcohol. The same applies to marijuana smokers or cocaine users. The term used to define these in Vedanta is *vasanas*. The way we interact with the world around us develops impressions that lead to such desires. These desires always dictate our actions, and our mind is constantly flooded with thoughts—thoughts about subtle desires that we feel, if fulfilled, will be the source of happiness. 

Clearly, the object, emotion, or thought that we are seeking does not carry happiness. If it did, everyone would experience it, but they don’t. Thus, the scriptures tell us that our personality has embedded in it the happiness code. Our true nature is happiness. Pure consciousness in us is blissful. We are unable to experience it because of the cover of *vasanas* that we have accumulated during our lifetime to date. When we act in this world with an egocentric desire, we accumulate more desires. When we act in this world without any egocentric desires, we feel bliss.

Water drops flow towards water to merge with it. Mercury droplets are in a hurry to merge with other droplets. It is in our nature to seek our true selves. The consciousness in us (jeevatama) is seeking to merge into pure, universal consciousness (Parmatma).
Bringing these together is YOG. 

Doing yogasana is one of eight steps in achieving this. Patanjali called this pursuit Ashtanga Yog - The eight limbs of yog. 
As we practice Yog, we should keep in mind that we must strive to practice these steps of Yog every day of our life.

[10/21/25, 7:39:48 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: THE  UNKNOWN  

There are things we do not know. There are questions that went unanswered in our childhood, and as we grew up, we stopped asking them—until we have children of our own. When I questioned my parents repeatedly, they likely said, "It's too late now, go to sleep." Honestly, I don’t remember, but that’s what I told my own children.

Whenever we try to comprehend these mysteries using our faculties—body, mind, and intellect—we often come up empty-handed. Our sages faced the same dilemma, as recorded in the Taittiriya Upanishad:

“Yato vacho nivartante,  
aprapya manasa saha.”

"That, from which my mental faculties keep returning, without reaching."

When direct inquiry fails, we turn to indirect methods. In mathematics, for instance, we often assign a symbol to the unknown, like "Let’s assume the unknown is X." We then apply logic to solve for X, and once found, we say, “Therefore, X equals...”

Similarly, our ancestors represented the unknown with a sound symbol: “Om.” But then, what is Om? Indirect inquiry led to three answers, forming the universal laws of causation:

Laws of Causation

1. Every effect must have a cause.
2. Effects are nothing but the cause itself in different forms.
For example, different gold ornaments are simply variations of the gold nugget found in the mine. Similarly, all the pots made by a potter—whether a honey pot or a spittoon—are simply clay in various forms.
3. When the cause is removed from the effect, nothing remains.

Our sages likely understood this when they wrote the Isha Upanishad, as the answer appears in its very first verse. The title "Isha Upanishad" means "The Word of God":

ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात्पूर्णमुदच्यते ।
पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते ॥

“Poornamadah poornamidam poornaat poornamudachyate,  
Poornasya poornamadaya poornamevaavashishyate.”

“THAT is Whole, THIS is Whole.  
This Whole manifests from that Whole, and  
When this Whole is removed (negated) from that Whole,  
What remains is Whole.”

This verse is considered by many to be the most significant in Vedanta. It is said that if there were ever a holocaust (Pralaya) and all Vedantic scriptures were lost except for this verse, future generations could recreate the entire Vedantic body of knowledge through contemplation on this single verse.

“THAT” refers to the unknown we are seeking to understand—the Supreme Being, by whatever name we choose: Bhagwan, God, Khuda, Vahe Guru, Reality, Truth, or Consciousness. “THIS” refers to the world as we know or experience it—the Cosmos. Logic and set theory teach us that two “Wholes” cannot exist separately; they must be one and the same. “THIS” manifests from “THAT,” exists in “THAT,” and when negated through knowledge and wisdom, what remains is “THAT.”

Adi Guru Shankaracharya illustrated this concept with the example of a rope and a snake. During a camping trip, if your grandchild runs to you at night, claiming there is a snake beside the tent, you might bring a flashlight only to discover that what appeared to be a snake was merely a rope left there while setting up the tent. The snake manifested from the rope, existed in the rope, and when the darkness of ignorance was dispelled and the snake was negated, what remained was the rope.

Vedantic literature is full of such verses that may seem nonsensical at first but require a teacher to explain. This is why the wisdom portion of the Vedas is called Upanishad—what is to be learned while sitting at the feet of a teacher. Make it a part of your daily life.

Life of Yogic Masters 

In all my health groups, discussions often arise about the merits of our rich cultural heritage—yoga, pranayama, and meditation. Given the nutritional richness of Indian spices, one might expect that our yogic and spiritual masters would have lived long and healthy lives. Typically, these discussions emerge in response to my criticism of dairy, ghee, and oil. This led me to research the lives of spiritual and yogic masters over the last 150 years. Among sixteen masters, their life spans ranged from 39 to 100 years, with an average of 78 years and a median of 77.5 years. Even when excluding the two extremes, the average life span of the remaining 14 was 79.2 years

I was fortunate to be blessed by three of these masters and even cooked many meals for two of them. Here is the raw data:

1. Mahavatar Babaji: 74  
2. Vivekananda: 39  
3. Shivananda: 76  
4. Ramana Maharshi: 71  
5. Kuvalyananda: 82  
6. T. Krishnamacharya: 100  
7. Paramahansa Yogananda: 59  
8. Anandamayi Ma: 86  
9. Dhirendra Brahmachari: 70  
10. Mahesh Yogi: 90  
11. BKS Iyengar: 96  
12. Pattabhi Jois: 94  
13. TKV Desikachar: 78  
14. Chinmayananda: 77  
15. Swami Rama: 71  
16. Dayanand Saraswati: 85  

This raises an important question: Why is the lifespan of these yogic masters comparable to that of an average American, who often has an unhealthy diet and lifestyle? Compared to people living in Blue Zones around the world, the life expectancy of yogic masters falls short. People in Blue Zones do not practice yoga, pranayama, or meditation, nor do they include rich spices in their diet. So, why the disconnect? I believe there are two main reasons:

1. Dietary Misconceptions:
Our ancestors may have been mistaken about the benefits of milk, yogurt, butter, ghee, and oil. If these yogic masters had excluded dairy and refined oils from their diets, they might have lived an additional 10-20 years.

2. Meal Timing:
We also got it wrong regarding the timing of dinner. It is better to finish meals before sunset or at least before it gets dark. Most spiritual masters had late dinners and long eating windows. 

The Jains got it right with Chauvihar, but they also erred with dairy. I have visited Veeraytan, Girnar, and Palitana and interacted with many Jain spiritual masters who suffer from high cholesterol and heart disease. The main culprit is dairy.

I meet many people in India who are on chronic medications, and they tell me they have started practicing yoga, pranayama, and meditation. These are all good practices that I follow and strongly recommend. However, to reverse chronic diseases, you must stop consuming the foods that are causing the disease in the first place.

[10/21/25, 7:39:49 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: OUR NEEDS, WANTS & VALUES

Humans are always seeking happiness, but what we pursue to achieve it varies from person to person and can change over time. Once we achieve what we seek, the joy is fleeting, and soon we find ourselves chasing the next source of happiness. This cycle has been studied by scholars and extensively explored in the wisdom of Vedanta and the Bhagavad Gita. 

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs
Abraham Maslow, a psychologist from Columbia University, delved into why people do what they do. In his 1943 paper, "Hierarchy of Needs," he explained human motivation through a hierarchy of needs. This concept was influential during my studies at IIT Kanpur and has guided me along with my exploration of Vedanta.

Maslow emphasized focusing on people's positive qualities rather than viewing them as a "bag of symptoms." His work influenced Martin Seligman, who later developed the field of Positive Psychology.

Maslow stressed the importance of focusing on the positive qualities in people, as opposed to treating them as a "bag of symptoms". This was later picked up by others and notably Martin Seligman in 1999 who became the President of American Psychological Association and developed the field of Positive Psychology. 

Maslow's thesis is simple: human needs can be classified into five hierarchical categories, and as people satisfy lower-level needs, they move up to higher levels:

1. Physiological Body Needs
These are biological necessities for human survival, such as air, water, food, shelter, clothing, warmth, sex, and sleep. They are the most critical needs, as other needs become secondary until these are met.

2. Safety Needs
Once physiological needs are satisfied, the need for safety and security becomes prominent. Today, family and societal laws and order fulfill this need for most people.

3. Love & Belonging Needs
These involve emotional needs for relationships, affiliation, and connectedness. Family, friends, and social groups often fulfill this need. When I first arrived in Los Angeles 50 years ago, I desperately sought a familiar face and befriended a Pakistani roommate. Many wealthy Americans find themselves lacking in this area, surrounded by people yet feeling lonely.

4. Esteem Needs (Ego)
This level includes self-worth, accomplishment, and respect. Maslow divided these into esteem for oneself (dignity, achievement) and the desire for reputation or respect from others (status, prestige). This need leads to the pursuit of better jobs, clothing, ornaments, cars, and homes.

5. Self-Actualization Needs
This is the highest level and involves realizing one's potential, seeking personal growth, and experiencing peak moments. It is doing something for its own sake, not to satisfy any lower-level needs.
In today’s societies, most educated people can fulfill the three lower-level needs easily and find themselves at the level of “Need for Esteem”.  However, many get stuck there, unable to rise to the Self-Actualization” need. This phase differs slightly from what Vedanta calls “Self-Realization” but serves as a precursor to it. The intoxication of esteem is referred to as Maya Moh, or Maya Jaal in Vedanta. Sometimes a significant event, such as heart attack or a stroke or an accident can awaken us to the reality that we already have everything we need to be happy. During COVID-19, many realized the value of family and a simple life. Some awakening realizations included:
- Giving up uncomfortable designer clothes that we often wear to impress others.
- We eat what we enjoy, not expensive restaurant meals to show off.
- Expensive wines and single malt scotches were never truly our preference; fresh lime water is more pleasing.
- Imported caviars and cheeses weren’t really our taste; traditional foods like aloo chaat and sarson ka saag were always our favorites.

We often do things in others' presence that we wouldn’t do alone, out of a desire to climb a social ladder of false values. When a life jolt, like a loved one’s illness or death or COVID-19, occurs, it opens our eyes to reality. Vedanta echoes this idea, emphasizing that one’s true nature is happiness. 

Tat Twam ASI
“That (what you are searching for) You Are”

Modern thinkers, through their research, reach similar realizations.

Rethinking Values: Is Time Really Money?
The belief that "time is money" is widespread, but is it true? The COVID-19 crisis prompted us to question many societal norms. Harvard psychologist Ashley Whillans explored the relationship between time and money. After surveying people across economic backgrounds, she concluded:
“Nothing less than our health and happiness depends on reversing the innate notion that time is money.”
Whillans, who teaches negotiation at Harvard Business School, focuses on the trade-offs between time and money. She notes:

“Focusing on chasing wealth is a trap, because it leads only to an increased focus on chasing wealth.”

Most people focus too much on work and earning money, neglecting time for themselves. Shifting the mindset to prioritize time over money offers benefits. Her research shows that once basic needs and future savings are covered, additional wealth adds little to happiness. In her words:

“Unsurprisingly, most people focus too much on working and and making money and not enough on having more time. But shifting your mindset to prioritize time over money can have several benefits.”

Her research shows that after earning enough to cover basic needs and future savings, additional wealth does little for happiness. In her words:

“Once people start making a lot of money, they begin to think they're doing worse in life, because they become obsessed with comparing themselves to those who are richer. Even multimillionaires make the mistake of believing that money, and not time, will enrich their lives.” 

A survey of the world’s wealthiest found 75% (many with net worth over $10 million) felt that they needed "a lot more" money to be happy. This mindset is misguided. Parts of our brain are programmed to choose vice over virtue, leading to unhealthy choices. Many in my health groups struggle to get over addictions acquired in their past pursuit of false values.

In adversity, there is opportunity. Let's use these realizations to reach Maslow’s fifth level and focus on what we truly enjoy, not how we are perceived.

World Happiness Report
In 2011, the UN unanimously adopted a resolution promoting sustainable happiness and well-being. This initiative, introduced by Bhutan and supported by 68 member states, led to the annual World Happiness Report, first published in 2012. The 11th report, released in 2023, again highlighted Scandinavian countries at the top.

One conclusion from these reports is that the happiness of Scandinavian countries relates more to human relationships and work-life balance than financial wealth. Social security for healthcare and old age can surpass economic gains in contributing to happiness. Pressuring children for economic success may shortchange them from life's success.

Many of us focus on amassing large savings out of fear of unexpected medical emergencies in old age, neglecting health and wellness, often leading to self-fulfilling prophecies. Adopting PBWF/IF/10K lifestyle changes can improve health, boosting confidence in personal health management and significantly impacting happiness. The fifth pillar of health not only improves physical health but fosters happiness regardless of physical condition.

[10/21/25, 7:39:51 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: I have opened the group for Q&A. Please feel free to ask questions on the subject matter covered so far. I am repeating the 12 point guidelines as many people keep asking for them. Also repeating the post about 2 most frequently asked questions. Hopefully you will read it before asking the question. 👇
[10/21/25, 7:39:52 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••• 2 Most Frequently Asked Questions ••••

I will be opening the group for Q&A now. But before I do that I want you to understand that many of the most frequently asked questions are flawed to begin with. Here are two examples. 

1. “What should my diet be to prevent diabetes, stroke, heart attack, hypertension, asthma, arthritis, Alzheimer’s, etc.?”

The problem with this question is that it assumes a different diet is needed to prevent each disease. If that were true, how would we choose which disease to prevent and which one to ignore? This logic simply doesn’t hold.

A truly healthy diet should benefit all chronic diseases. The PBWF/IF/10K diet and lifestyle I recommend does exactly that — it helps prevent and even reverse most chronic conditions.

Of course, for individuals with advanced disease, organ failure, or artificial implants, medical advice specific to their condition is necessary. That said, most elements of the diet are benign and generally safe. One notable exception is for those with advanced kidney disease, where some green leafy vegetables high in oxalates may need to be restricted.

2. “I have this symptom, and that one… what should my diet be?”

Here again, the same principle applies.

Nutrient deficiencies (or excesses) show up as symptoms, but those symptoms vary widely from person to person. While our genetics are quite similar, epigenetically we are all unique — so the symptoms of same deficiency might look completely different in different individuals.

What makes matters more complicated is that we usually don’t suffer from just one deficiency. When multiple deficiencies (or toxic excesses) are involved, the number of symptom combinations becomes enormous — possibly thousands or even millions. Expecting a doctor to diagnose these just by listening to your symptoms is unrealistic.

This is why treatment, whether conventional or alternative, often feels like trial and error. Another issue is reporting bias — people who don’t benefit from a treatment usually stay silent, but those who experience improvement tell everyone. For instance, someone might say, “I had this issue for 10 years, saw 10 doctors, and nothing worked. But this homeopath/Ayurvedic/alternative doctor cured me.” Excited, they share their experience with 10 others. The 9 others who didn’t benefit say nothing — but the one who did spreads the word widely, creating a false impression of a miracle cure.

The strength of the PBWF/IF/10K approach is that it naturally eliminates both deficiencies and excesses (which can also be toxic), allowing the body to heal. That’s why I recommend starting with a 3–5 day green juice fast. It offers deep detoxification and high-density nutrition — a powerful foundation for recovery.

Most problems we experience are systemic in nature and are result of many years of consuming unhealthy food and living an unhealthy lifestyle. It is not a good idea to correct the symptoms (high blood pressure or high blood sugar or high LDL cholesterol etcetera), even if you could, without addressing the root cause of them. Correcting symptoms with some concoction (Nani ka Nuskha) or herb is not a good idea. At least you are now conscious of the problem and willing to do something about it. If the symptoms are lowered without correcting the root cause, you will develop a false sense of relief. Your body will keep getting sicker and sicker and come back with bigger problems like heart attack or stroke. Killing messengers is never a good idea. 

When you follow the 12 point guidelines the root causes of lifestyle diseases get addressed and your body heals. And when the body heals, everything heals.

I am posting below the 12 point guidelines again in a summarized table. Please print it and post it on your refrigerator or desk. I get asked many times to repeat it.

I am sharing the post again:
[10/21/25, 11:46:12 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••   DAIRY MYTH   •••

A long-standing, prevalent belief champions dairy as the perfect food. While it may indeed be ideal for calves it is not the case for humans. The perfect food for humans is human milk, and that too only during infancy. Humans are unique in two respects: (1) they continue milk consumption beyond infancy and (2) they consume the milk of another species. The origins of this practice are murky but it may have begun thousands of years ago during a famine. In desperate times consumption of cow’s milk, which led to survival, may have sparked the widespread domestication of cows.

This topic presents a personal conflict for me. Numerous doctors in the Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement advise against dairy, supported by a plethora of studies. However Ayurveda, an ancient Indian wisdom, endorses it, albeit sparingly. Most PBWF recommendations align with Ayurveda except for dairy products like milk and ghee.

All mammals nurse their young with milk specifically formulated for their offspring's growth rate. For instance, a calf grows tenfold in six months, necessitating a milk composition rich in proteins, fats, and growth hormones like IGF-1. These components, while beneficial for calves, can potentially fuel cancer cell growth in humans without affecting normal cells, akin to how fertilizers promote lawn growth but also enable weeds to flourish unchecked.

INDIAN STUDY ON DAIRY PROTEIN
A groundbreaking study in 1967 by Dr. Gopalan and Madhvan at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad (India) examined the effects of dietary protein levels on cancer development. Mice, injected with a carcinogen and fed diets of varying protein levels, showed a direct correlation between high dairy protein intake and cancer growth. This study, which initially perplexed many, including Dr. Colin Campbell, laid the groundwork for a significant shift in understanding the relationship between animal protein and cancer.

Dr. Campbell's subsequent research, including the comprehensive China Study, underscored the detrimental effects of animal proteins, particularly from dairy, on our health. These findings advocate for minimizing dairy and animal protein consumption in diets exceeding 8% total protein, especially in affluent societies with abundant food choices.

It's important to recognize that dairy products do not cause cancer - they only contribute to its progression. The initiation of cancer is primarily due to gene mutations, which can result from a variety of factors such as radiation and toxic chemicals present in our environment. This suggests that cancer-causing agents were less prevalent in ancient times. 
In scenarios of food scarcity, dairy protein can be considered a viable nutritional option. Historically milk likely played a crucial role during times of famine, potentially saving many communities from extinction. It is also worth noting that gene mutations caused by toxic chemicals and radiation were presumably less common in the past due to the limited presence of these harmful agents.

In 1967, the per capita milk consumption in India was 107 ml per person- today it has quadrupled to 427 ml per person. This increase occurred despite widespread knowledge of milk's potential role in promoting health issues, including cancer. While the Government of India recognized Dr. Gopalan's contributions with the Padma Bhushan award, his advice on this matter was not heeded.

Why Milk Today is Harmful Compared to The Past
Today's dairy products differ significantly from those our ancestors consumed and we face different health challenges. Factors contributing to the harm caused by modern dairy include industrial farming practices, the genetic composition of dairy cows and the increased presence of environmental carcinogens. Additionally, lifestyle changes and increased life expectancy call for a reevaluation of dairy's role in our diet. Here are some examples:
* Dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination. 
* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.
* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield. 
* They are injected with high-dose antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions. 
All these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk cows produce and are very harmful to human health. 

Life expectancy in the olden days was low and an age of 70-80 was considered a life long lived. Very few lived beyond that. Today we are talking about increasing human life expectancy to 100+ years like in Blue Zones. 
I have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Michael Gregor. They all are against consuming dairy products. Dr. Collin Campbell did concede that if the total protein in a diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay to consume as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows.

Why Dairy Is Unhealthy?
Numerous studies and expert opinions highlight dairy's potential health risks including its ineffectiveness in bone health, its link to cancer, and its contribution to various diseases and conditions. Widespread lactose intolerance further underscores dairy's unsuitability for many. Here are some specific examples:
(1) There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries in Africa which have the lowest rate of milk consumption also have the lowest rate of osteoporosis. Conversely, countries consuming the most milk have the  highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers. 
(2) Dairy consumption increases the body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks. 
(3) According to a 2006 study by Harvard researchers, conducted with 10,000 women aged 26-46, the women who consumed the most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy product consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer. 
(4) Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body. 
(5) Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body. 
(6) Milk and cheese can cause acne. 
(7) Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases. 
(8) Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome. 
(9) Dairy is a cause of autoimmune diseases like arthritis.
(10) Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant. 
(11) Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes. 
(12) Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation. 
(13) Other problems associated with dairy include allergies and sinus issues. 
(14) Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet. 

Calcium Myth
Contrary to popular belief, the calcium in dairy is not efficiently absorbed due to its unfavorable phosphorus to calcium ratio. In order to absorb calcium one needs a calcium product that is conducive to absorption. The presence of phosphorus binds calcium to make calcium phosphate and biphosphate and diphosphate and makes it unavailable for absorption. To absorb calcium it must be available without phosphorus and milk does not provide that. So, for the most part, the calcium in the milk is in nonabsorbable. This is the reason why milk does not help people with osteoporosis. It even hurts them. 
Giving calcium pills as supplement also doesn’t help people with osteoporosis. Calcium just goes through the body and is excreted. Even vitamin D supplementation does not help. 
One has to do something to the bones to get calcium inside the bones. All the trials of supplementing calcium with vitamin D have failed. 
Dr. Lustig of UCSF recommends giving calcium to phosphorus in ratio of 4:1 whereas in milk it is 1:2. 
To achieve satisfactory calcium absorption other forms of calcium are required like calcium chloride or citrate. 
Here are some additional comments that support PBWF doctors' view against dairy. 
* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and even headaches after giving up dairy. 
* Dr. Neil Bernard filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order. 
* The US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in its dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health was one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and had called them “utterly ridiculous”.
* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia. 

Conclusion
Despite its historical role in human nutrition, the evidence against dairy consumption's health benefits is compelling. Alternatives to dairy, including plant-based milks and yogurts, offer nutritious and safe options for those seeking to avoid dairy's pitfalls. Acknowledging both the scientific findings and the cultural practices surrounding dairy consumption can guide us towards healthier dietary choices.

[10/22/25, 7:31:28 AM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• GREEN JUICING •••

Based on my experience in various health groups, I'd like to share four key insights:
1. Ease of Adoption: 
Some health advice is easier said than done. For example, consuming green leafy vegetables without using oil or ghee is challenging in Indian cuisine, where saag is a common preparation requiring these fats.
2. Dietary Changes: 
It is often hard to give up our favorite foods even when we know they are unhealthy. However, introducing tasty, healthy options can naturally displace less healthy choices.
3. Impact of Changes:
Gradual changes often yield less noticeable improvements which can lead to a loss of confidence. Making a few dramatic changes can keep these efforts top of mind and encourage persistence.
4.Ripple Effects:
A single conscious change can lead to multiple subconscious improvements and accrue significant benefits. For example, starting a daily walking routine led me to naturally reject calorie-dense snacks like cookies and donuts, mindful of the effort I'd put into walking.

Why Green Juice?
Green leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which help release Nitric Oxide in the bloodstream, unclogging blood vessels and reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues.
When I discussed dietary guidelines I mentioned that we need to consume a minimum 1% of our body weight in vegetables and half of that should be in green leafy vegetables. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn suggests six daily servings of green leafy vegetables for heart patients, including notable individuals like Bill Clinton. Given the culinary habits in India where salads are uncommon, I recommend juicing as a practical alternative, although it's second to consuming greens raw or blanched.
I recommend watching the documentaries “Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead" available on Netflix, and "Super Juice Me" on YouTube. These showcase dramatic health transformations through extended juice fasts. Inspired by these, I started with a five-day juice fast 11 years ago that transformed my life.
One should start with a 3-5 day juice fast, consuming 8-12 ounces of juice four to five times a day. After that continue with three glasses daily 15-20 minutes before meals to maximize health benefits until you can reduce or eliminate chronic medications.
The main goal here is to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetables (fruits should be eaten as a whole or to just make vegetable juice tastier). Juicing makes it easy. 

Selecting A Juicer
As green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed, especially for people who are on medications or want to lose weight. 
Consider hydraulic, double helical screw, and single augur juicers based on your budget and needs. Avoid high-speed centrifugal juicers as they can degrade nutrients and are less effective with leafy greens.
For patients who are critically ill, it is advisable to consume juice with minimum pulp. It is light on their stomach and for the same amount of fullness, they can consume more nutrients. (Not sure you need the last line re: cancer here since you mention critically ill above). 

Do You Lose Fiber?
A question often asked is “aren’t you removing fiber in juicing?”
The answer is that there are two types of fiber- soluble and insoluble. Juicing retains soluble fiber and some of the insoluble fiber as well. One should eat fruits as a whole and juice only vegetables. You can add some fruit to enhance the taste and yes Granny Smith apples because they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables. 
There is a saying: First thing in the morning, if you poop before you finish peeing; you are in good health. You soon will experience that.

Green Juice Recipe
Before diving into the recipe, it's important to note that there isn't a strict chemical composition required for making juice. Unlike the precise formulations often found in Ayurveda, the primary aim of juicing is to enjoy consuming green leafy vegetables in a tasty beverage, rather than enduring a bitter concoction solely for health benefits. Since everyone's taste preferences vary, feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your liking. The goal is to create a juice that's so delicious, your guests will ask for a second glass. 

Consider the recipe as consisting of three main groups of vegetables, along with some seeds:
1. Apples and Spice Group: This includes four Granny Smith apples (or any other suitable juicing apples), two lemons, and two thumb-sized pieces of ginger.
2. Hydration Group: Comprising one bunch of celery, one large English cucumber (or two medium regular cucumbers), and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the juice's water content, and you can easily double these ingredients if desired.
3.Leafy Greens Group: Choose any combination of one to three of the following: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beetroot greens, cabbage, etc. (2-3 bunches total). Alternatively, for a variation, replace this group with carrots and beetroots.

Enhance your juice by adding some flax seeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds. These seeds not only fulfill part of your Omega-3 needs but also provide fats that aid in nutrient absorption. Don't hesitate to include other non-starchy vegetables like bottle gourd, butter melon, raw turmeric, and mint. There are no restrictions—let your taste buds guide you!

Here is a typical green juice mixture in my kitchen. See in the picture from left to right:
Chard, Kale, Arugula, Bottle Gourd, Romaine lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Beetroot, Raw Turmeric root, Green apple, Carrot and Fenel. 

Shelf Life
Juice can be stored safely in airtight glass bottles in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours or frozen for longer storage, leaving space for expansion.

Organic vs Nonorganic
Always thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables. Seek organic sources if possible, but don't avoid conventional produce out of fear of pesticides; the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh the potential risks.
I recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market near you. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will remember you and always tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided. 

JUICE vs SMOOTHY 
This is one of the most frequently asked questions and there clearly is big confusion on this subject, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this. Before proceeding I want to make it clear that eating leafy greens raw as salad or blanched is the best option. The chewing action in the mouth mixed with saliva provides the most nutrition and absorption. Fruits ofcourse shoul always be eaten as whole fruits except some green apples (Granny Smith variety in US as they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables) which should be added to green juice. So the question is only, what is the second best option. 
1. Smoothies require high speed blending, this makes the air oxidize the nutrients. So you have some nutrient loss due to oxidization.
2. Because you have to mix a cup of water to start the process and because the pulp is retained, there are only half as many nutrients in a glass of smoothie as opposed to a glass of juice. 
3. Because of air and insoluble fiber you can not consume much smoothie and make up for reduced nutrients by drinking more. On the contrary the juice feels less filling than smoothie. 
4. A good juicer retains most of the soluble fiber in juice. Some of the insoluble fiber is also retained in small particles that go through the screen. The remaining insoluble fiber which is rejected, has little nutrient left. It is also not needed for bowl movement because one gets more than enough from juice. 
5. Juice does not stay in stomach much and passes through to small intestine quickly. Smoothies need to be digested and remain much longer in the stomach. Smoothies are not a good choice for juice fasts. 
6. Juice has a much longer refrigeration shelf life. You can juice only twice a week and store it in airtight glass bottles. It can also be frozen so one can reduce juice making to even once a week. 

This post clarifies green juicing, its benefits, and its practical implementation, aiming to promote better health practices and dietary adjustments.

[10/22/25, 6:51:35 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Observations from Q&A Session•

During the Q&A session, many of you asked questions about your health and how to recover from lifestyle diseases. As I explained in my post titled “2 Most FAQs,” the diet and lifestyle recommendations are not different for different lifestyle diseases. However, they can vary from person to person.

While we humans are genetically quite similar, we are epigenetically very different. Our microbiome composition—shaped by our unique diets and lifestyles—plays a major role in how diseases manifest. This means that even if symptoms appear similar, the root causes can differ significantly between individuals. The reverse is also true: the same underlying cause may show up as very different symptoms in different people. That’s why trying to guess the cause based on symptoms alone is an imperfect science, full of hits and misses. I don’t practice that kind of guesswork. Doctors and naturopaths often do, with varying levels of success.

A far more reliable approach is to assess your current diet and lifestyle using the 12-point guideline I’ve provided. This will help you identify areas of non-compliance that need correction. When you align with these guidelines, the body begins to heal—and when the body heals, all diseases caused by poor diet and lifestyle begin to resolve.

But this process is personal. Only you can determine whether your body is aligned with these principles, because your microbiome is unique to you. Once you’ve ensured that:
- Your food is 100% plant-based and whole,
- You’re eating within an 8–10 hour daytime window,
- Roughly 20% of your calories come from each food group,
- You’re including a variety of foods from each of the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, beans&legumes and nuts&seeds. 
Then there is no further adjustment needed. Whether you eat potatoes, sweet potatoes, or taro root (arbi) on a given day is entirely your choice. Listen to your body—it will guide you. Since variety is important, I suggest including at least seven different foods from each food group every week, along with a wide range of spices. Spices are rich in antioxidants and should ideally be consumed daily, with each meal.

As I mentioned in yesterday’s post, “2 Most FAQs,” many of you are still asking the very questions I addressed there. It also appears that some of you haven’t yet read my posts on the protein and dairy myths. I strongly encourage you to go through them—all your questions are answered there.

This week, we’ll cover the remaining four pillars of health: detoxification, circadian rhythm, physical activity, and emotional and spiritual well-being.
[10/22/25, 6:51:36 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: There are many misconceptions about diabetes among many people including doctors. It is not their fault, this is what medical community is taught and this is what they practice. They are taught that 
1. Diabetes is an incurable diseases. It is a progressive disease and will require increasing medication dosages over time. 
2. ⁠It must be managed by eating low glycemic food. 
3. ⁠One should keep fasting sugar and PP sugar levels low. 
4. ⁠One must replace sugar with noncaloric sweeteners. 
5. ⁠One must avoid fruits like mangoes and bananas. 

When you follow their advise, diabetes is never healed and you eventually land up having kidney problems and often progress to needing dialysis. 
It is very unfortunate that this misinformation is so widely spread. We will see it in another two weeks that this is all incorrect. That is the whole purpose of this group.

Having covered the five pillars of health, we will now move on to discuss Chronic Diseases. But before I do that, I want to discuss various factors that come into play as far as our understanding of health is concerned. These have to do with the perceptions we carry as a result of information being fed to us by the research labs at Pharma, food and health care industries and government and media. During this week we will cover following:
1. What is Normal?
2. Placebo & Nocebo Effects
3. Modern vs Alternate Medicine
4. Bias in Research
- Funding Bias
- Researcher’s Personal Bias 
- Negative Outcome Bias
- Publication Bias

[10/22/25, 6:51:39 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • CONFESSIONS OF A PHARMA EXEC •

The consumption of medications is not as harmless as many believe. All drugs come with side effects and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Pharmaceutical companies often try to avoid disclosing these risks.

The following video features Dr. John Virapen, an Indian executive who worked for Eli Lilly, one of the largest pharmaceutical companies in the world. Dr. Virapen courageously exposed some of the industry’s darkest secrets. Please watch the linked video below.

Here are some quotes from his talk:
1. “The pharmaceutical industry is not interested in curing any disease you may have. They are more interested in making sure you stay sick. They focus on symptomatic treatment. They prefer patients with chronic conditions—diabetes, heart disease, Parkinson’s, rheumatoid arthritis, arteriosclerosis—because such patients live a long time and must take medication for the rest of their lives.”
2. “A few years ago, Eli Lilly was fined $1.4 billion by a Pennsylvania court for knowingly selling the schizophrenia drug Zyprexa to elderly patients. The drug made them drowsy—and also diabetic. Ironically, Eli Lilly is the largest producer of diabetes medications in the world.”
3. “But the news of this settlement never came out. Do you know why? Because the media also works with the pharmaceutical industry—just like the government does.” 
4. “Pharma companies use the media to cover up their dirty work. You only learn the truth when it’s too late. So you need to raise your awareness. Don’t blindly trust what your doctor tells you—because many of them are ignorant. They know little about the drugs they prescribe and care even less about the patients. They’re often focused on how much they’ll get paid. That’s how the pharma industry stays in power. They buy the doctors. And doctors get all their information from the pharmaceutical companies.”
5. “I know this because I was a pharmaceutical salesman. I was told never to talk about side effects. We were trained to use a method called FAB—Features, Advantages, Benefits. Talking about side effects was taboo. I also know for a fact that they hide serious side effects. I was in charge of the clinical trial for Prozac.”
6. “Former U.S. President George H.W. Bush’s father served on the board of Eli Lilly. One of George W. Bush’s advisors was a vice president at Eli Lilly. Donald Rumsfeld also held a top executive role in the pharmaceutical industry. Eli Lilly is one of the biggest financial contributors to the Republican Party.
7. “That, ladies and gentlemen, is the highest form of corruption. It’s called lobbying.”

[10/22/25, 6:51:41 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Opioid Crisis Update•

The recent opioid lawsuit was settled for $26 billion by four major pharmaceutical companies. The amount is to be paid over 18 years. However, the actual victims of the opioid epidemic—those who developed addictions or lost loved ones—will see little direct compensation. Most of the funds will go to state and local governments to support efforts addressing the crisis.

Meanwhile, many Americans have transitioned from prescription painkillers to street drugs like fentanyl, a far more dangerous synthetic opioid. Their suffering continues, with no end in sight.

Pharmaceutical companies, for their part, treat such massive settlements as simply the cost of doing business. With no personal accountability, no jail time for executives, and no meaningful reforms, the cycle of abuse and profit continues.

[10/22/25, 6:51:43 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •BELIEVE IT OR NOT•

Starch is actually healthy for diabetics. The real problem—for diabetics and non-diabetics alike—is sugar and refined foods. Surprisingly, so-called “low glycemic” foods can sometimes be more harmful for diabetics. That’s because many animal products and processed foods have a relatively low glycemic index (GI) but a high insulin index. For example, prawns have a glycemic index of zero, and pure fructose has a GI of only 25—yet both can be very harmful for diabetics.

The key point is this: insulin spikes are more damaging than sugar spikes.

This was clearly demonstrated in a study led by Dr. Robert Lustig at UCSF. A group of 43 obese children between the ages of 9 and 19—who regularly consumed high-sugar, ultra-processed foods—were put on a diet nearly identical to their usual one, with one crucial change: added sugar was replaced with starch. Their calorie intake and body weight were kept constant for nine days.

The results were striking:
- Visceral fat decreased by 7%
- Liver fat dropped by 22%
- Triglyceride levels fell by 49%
- The rate at which their bodies converted sugar into fat decreased by 46%
- Both blood glucose and insulin levels improved significantly

As liver fat reduced, the pancreas began to function better and could produce insulin more effectively.

In other words, the children’s metabolic syndrome was reversed—without any weight loss or calorie restriction. This proves an important point: not all calories are equal. Refined sugar is far more damaging to metabolic health than starch, protein, or fat.

Another serious issue with ultra-processed foods is their lack of fiber. While high-carb diets are often blamed for poor health, studies show that diets high in fiber-rich carbohydrates can produce similar metabolic benefits to low-carb diets. However, low-carb diets may come with long-term risks—such as increased susceptibility to kidney and liver disease in old age.

[10/23/25, 7:01:09 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • PLACEBO & NOCEBO EFFECTS •

We have long known that a patient’s belief in a particular medication or treatment plays a significant role in their recovery. Many alternative forms of treatment—practiced for centuries, even millennia—have produced surprising results.

I still remember visiting Hakims and Vaidyas over 70 years ago. These traditional healers (often incorrectly referred to as “doctors”) had excellent bedside manners. They would ask many detailed questions: What are you eating? How is your urine and stool? Any aches or pains? What is the color of your tongue and eyes? After a thorough examination, they would give a small paper package of medicine (called pudia) and advise dietary restrictions (parhej)—what to avoid and what to include while on the treatment.

In most cases, people would recover within a week or two. But the question remains: What actually healed the body?

- Was it the medication?
- Was it the dietary changes?
- Did the body heal itself?
- Or was it the positive belief that triggered healing?

What I have learned from doctors in the PBWF (Plant-Based Whole-Food) movement is that the human body is an incredibly sophisticated organism that is always trying to heal itself. So, most likely, healing came from a combination of #2, #3, and #4. What was in that pudia may not have made a real difference.

Modern medicine understands this phenomenon well. All new drugs must go through rigorous double-blind clinical trials. In such trials, patients are randomly divided into two groups. One group receives the actual drug being tested; the other receives an inactive substance with no therapeutic value (a placebo). Importantly, both groups are told they are receiving the real drug.

Surprisingly, both groups often show improvement. For a drug to be approved, the group receiving the real medication must show statistically better results than the placebo group. These are called double-blind trials because neither the patient nor the doctor knows who is getting what.

Interestingly, in recent years we have come to understand that the opposite of the placebo effect is also true. It’s called the Nocebo effect: when we strongly believe something bad is going to happen to us—it often does.

In ancient Indian Puranic stories, curses were frequently mentioned. It’s possible that the principle behind these curses was very similar to what we now call the Nocebo effect.

[10/23/25, 7:01:13 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Modern vs. Alternate Medicine•

The self-healing ability of the human body may not have been fully understood in earlier times, as it is today. As a result, the benefits observed from various forms of treatment were often attributed to the specific method used, rather than recognizing that the improvements could be due to the placebo effect. This led to the development of numerous theories and treatment modalities.

Today, we—the so-called educated class—refer to these unconventional approaches as Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM). (The term “complementary” was added later.) Traditional alternative medicine includes:
* Acupuncture
* Ayurveda
* Chiropractic
* Homeopathy
* Hydrotherapy
* Magnetic Therapy
* Naturopathy
* Unani Medicine
* Chinese & Oriental Medicine
* Gem Therapy
* Spiritual Healing (e.g., Tabiz and Vibhuti)

I’m sure many more could be added to this list. These therapies were widely practiced in different parts of the world until the early 20th century.

So, the question is: when did these therapies become “alternative”?
At the time, John D. Rockefeller and Andrew Carnegie were the two wealthiest men in America—Rockefeller held a monopoly over the oil industry (controlling 90% of it), while Carnegie dominated steel. Both were involved in philanthropy and supported many social causes.

In 1908, they proposed to the American Medical Association (AMA) and the U.S. government that it would be beneficial to evaluate the state of medical education and standardize it. It appeared to be a noble initiative. Carnegie hired an educator named Abraham Flexner for the job. (Abraham was the brother of Simon Flexner, a scientist at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research.)

After more than a year of research and travel across the U.S. and Canada, Abraham Flexner submitted a comprehensive report in 1910 titled “Medical Education in the United States and Canada”, now commonly known as the Flexner Report.

The report recommended the closure of all two-year diploma programs and the establishment of a standardized four-year curriculum. Strangely, the curriculum excluded any training in nutrition, even though herbal medicine made up nearly half of all treatments at the time.

The U.S. government accepted the recommendations, and what we now know as modern medicine began to take shape.
The aftermath was significant:
- All alternative treatments were effectively banned unless practiced by a licensed MD.
- Many small medical schools were closed or absorbed into larger institutions, often funded by powerful business interests.
- In under a decade, the number of medical colleges dropped from 650 to 50, and the number of medical students declined from 7,500 to 2,500.
- Numerous alternative practices were labeled as quackery and outlawed.
- Only those trained in the new four-year system and licensed to practice were permitted to prescribe medicine.
- Abraham Flexner was later appointed as the first director of Rockefeller’s philanthropic medical education programs.
[10/23/25, 7:01:15 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Doctors’ Advice on Medications•

Please do not send me details about your medications. I am not a doctor, and I’m not interested in knowing the specific names of drugs. All I need to know is whether you are taking any chronic medications and for what conditions.

You should ask yourself: Why am I taking this medication for the rest of my life?

Doctors are quick to prescribe medications because that is what they are taught in medical school. Once you start a medication, you often become a patient for life. That means you have to visit the doctor regularly just to get your prescriptions refilled. In India, many patients are also partly to blame—if a doctor doesn’t prescribe medicine, they feel disappointed or cheated.

Getting people off medications is not considered good practice in today’s system—it’s bad for business. So here are a few important observations:
* Doctors are quick to prescribe medication. It is not their fault. They are not trained in nutrition (because it’s not part of standard medical education). As a result, they often avoid discussing it. 
* Time constraints are another issue—doctors must see many patients, and the next one is always waiting.
* There is something called the “Medical Standard of Care.” These are the guidelines doctors must follow to keep their license to practice. If they don’t follow them, they could face lawsuits from patients or their families. This is more common in the U.S. than in India. In the U.S., the “Medical Standard of Care” is set by the governing bodies of each specialty. For example: (1) A General Practioner who is a member of ACP must follow guidelines of ACP. (2) A diabetes doctor must follow the guidelines of the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and (3) An endocrinologist should follow the guidelines established by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE).
* These governing bodies primarily serve the interests of their members, who pay regular membership fees. When new research suggests lowering the threshold for prescribing medication, they are quick to adopt those recommendations. But when new findings suggest a more conservative or less profitable approach, they are often slow
—or unwilling—to change. This leads to conflicting guidelines. 
In 2018 when ACP issued revised diabetes treatment relaxing them from 6.5 to 8.0 reading for HbA1C there was a huge hue and cry as this would have reduced many practitioners income by 49-60 percent. Within a week AACE reiterated their guidelines of 6.5% to protect income of their members. 

This is human nature. Once people become used to higher income, they resist any change that might reduce it. A Hindi couplet written 500 years ago captures this perfectly:

“Badhat badhat sampatti salil, man saroj badh jai,
Ghatat ghatat, puni na ghate, varu samul kumbhlaye.”

Translation:
As one’s wealth increases, so do his desires—just like a lotus in a pond that rises with the water level. When the water recedes, the lotus cannot adjust and withers away.

When your symptoms improve and you ask your doctor if you can stop taking medications, the answer is usually “No.” That’s because your doctor has been taught to believe that chronic conditions are incurable. From his perspective, your symptoms have improved only because of the medication.
As we begin to discuss specific diseases and medications, you will encounter these challenges. Some members have already written to me, saying they plan to ask their doctor about reducing medications. When you do this, please go prepared—have your data (your “ducks”) lined up. 
This is why, in defining the objective of this group, I specifically state:
“The goal is to empower members to get off chronic medications by teaching them an active lifestyle based on a PBWF (Plant-Based Whole-Foods) diet and Intermittent Fasting.”
Some of you ask me as to how can you convince your doctors to reduce your medicine. This is a very difficult task. Most doctors don’t have the time to reeducate themselves. Also specially if it means reducing their income level by half or more.
[10/23/25, 7:01:16 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: • In Defense of Doctors •

Most people live their young adult lives free of chronic diseases (I’m not referring to infectious diseases here). When you visit a doctor for the first time as an adult—usually around the age of 45–50—and he checks your blood pressure, blood sugar, cholesterol, and other markers, he has no idea about the trajectory of those markers.

For example, if your blood test shows an A1C of 7.8, he doesn’t know how rapidly that number has been increasing. Is it rising at a rate of 0.1 per month, or just 0.01? In that situation, it is prudent for him to assume the worst-case scenario. So, he prescribes medication. His objectives are twofold:

1. To change the trajectory and prevent the disease from getting worse.
2. To bring the marker into a range recommended by the professional association that governs his specialty.

For instance, if the doctor is a general practitioner and a member of the American College of Physicians (ACP), the guideline is to keep A1C below 8.0. His goal is simply to prevent the progression of diabetes, so a small dose of medication might be sufficient.

If the doctor is a member of the American Diabetes Association (ADA), he aims to bring the A1C below 7.0 and will likely prescribe a higher dose.

If the doctor is an endocrinologist and a member of the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), his target is an A1C below 6.5. He may prescribe two medications.

Most people, after leaving the doctor’s office and filling the prescription, start taking their medications regularly—but only make minor changes to their diet and lifestyle. The most common ones include replacing sugar with artificial sweeteners and switching from regular soft drinks to diet sodas (which, as we will see in later posts, can actually worsen the condition).

Now, if a particular patient—like yourself—is more conscientious and makes significant changes to diet and lifestyle, the numbers may improve dramatically by the time of the next doctor’s visit. However, when you ask the doctor to stop the medication, he may strongly resist. That’s because, during his medical training, he was taught that chronic diseases cannot be cured. He firmly believes your improved markers are due solely to the medication.

In my experience working with over 250,000 members, I encounter this situation frequently. Sooner or later, each one of you will face this same dilemma. That’s why I am raising this issue now—before we begin our in-depth discussion of chronic diseases starting next week. Each of you will need to find your own path and, eventually, have this conversation with your doctor.
[10/23/25, 7:01:17 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Alternate Medicine: 
Is it Only a Placebo Effect?•

Many who share success stories with alternative medicine aren’t lying or trying to promote an agenda. Some of these stories seem miraculous, turning people into lifelong believers. However, not all such successes are due to the placebo effect. My goal is to explain how various factors can influence our judgment and contribute to the spread of myths. Here are some factors to consider:

1. The human body is a self-healing organism, constantly striving to repair itself. Cells die and regenerate regularly, with cycles ranging from days to months.

2. When we’re sick, we tend to improve our diet and lifestyle unconsciously, which can aid recovery.

3. Because of these factors, the body usually heals itself. Recovery times vary based on the illness, ranging from weeks to years.

4. In times of illness, we often start by consulting traditional medical professionals. If treatments don’t work, we may turn to alternative therapies like Homeopathy, Ayurveda, or Acupuncture.

5. Sometimes, recovery coincides with trying alternative treatments, leading us to mistakenly attribute healing to these therapies. In reality, the body may have healed on its own.

6. These perceived successes are then shared as proof of alternative medicine’s effectiveness, even though the treatment may not have been responsible.

7. Success stories get more attention than failures, which are rarely published. This creates a bias, as we are more likely to hear about positive outcomes, further spreading the idea that alternative therapies work when conventional medicine doesn’t.

If you’re reading this, you’re likely a health-conscious individual. Keep these points in mind when you hear about miraculous recoveries. For more insight, check out the documentaries *What The Health* and *Death by Medicine*.
[10/24/25, 7:01:06 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •SIDE EFFECTS and ADRS, OF DRUGS•

Most of us are aware of the concept of drug side effects, which can be either negative or positive. The goal of any drug manufacturer is to minimize negative side effects. If side effects are severe, a drug is unlikely to receive approval from regulatory authorities. Additionally, most side effects are evaluated over short time frames; therefore, effects that only become apparent after prolonged use—such as over decades—may go undetected. Drug manufacturers often aim to minimize the disclosure of side effects, revealing only those they cannot conceal or are legally required to disclose.

It’s important to recognize that all individuals are epigenetically different, so just as specific foods affect us in varied ways, specific drugs also have different effects on each person. This variability makes it difficult to identify all side effects during drug trials. It is not unreasonable to assume that there are certain side effects that your doctor may not be aware of. For example, it has long been known that many diabetic medications can increase the risk of heart disease. However, manufacturers of these medications are only required to demonstrate that their drugs lower blood glucose levels, not that they do not increase the risk of heart disease. 

I personally had to stop using Avandia after discovering its potential risks, and I switched to Actos, only to stop that as well for the same reason. This led me to change my diet and lifestyle.

If you are a diabetic, your doctor may be so concerned about your risk of heart disease that they recommend you take statins as a preventive measure. Interestingly, the reverse is also true: if you are a heart patient taking certain drugs, your likelihood of developing diabetes significantly increases.

Understanding Side Effects and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs)

The distinction between side effects and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) is often misunderstood. A side effect refers to unintended effects of a drug that occur within the therapeutic range, usually an undesirable secondary effect in addition to the desired therapeutic outcome. Side effects can vary among individuals.

An adverse drug reaction (ADR) is defined as “a response to a medicinal product that is noxious and unintended.” It is estimated that between 3% and 7% of all hospitalizations are due to ADRs, which can occur at normal therapeutic doses. In contrast, drug overdoses represent a different issue entirely.

The leading cause of ADRs is multiple drug interactions. It is crucial for individuals taking several medications to check for potential adverse interactions. The situation becomes even more complex as individuals can respond differently to each drug. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the U.S. maintains a database of ADRs, which healthcare providers are required to report and is publicly accessible. Medscape also offers a drug interaction checker that can be useful. Of course, discontinuing medications altogether would eliminate this concern.
[10/24/25, 7:01:07 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •NNT & NNH OF DRUGS•

Having explained the concepts of side effects and ADRs, let’s discuss how various drugs are evaluated in terms of their performance. Two critical criteria in drug evaluation are Number Needed to Treat (NNT) and Number Needed to Heal (NNH).

Number Needed to Treat (NNT) refers to the number of patients a doctor or researcher needs to treat to prevent one additional adverse outcome, such as death. For instance, if a cancer drug reduces the mortality rate from 30% to 25%, the NNT is calculated as 1 divided by the reduction in mortality rate (0.30 - 0.25), resulting in an NNT of 20.

Number Needed to Harm (NNH) refers to the number of patients who need to be treated for one to experience a harmful side effect. For many drugs, the NNH is often lower than the NNT. For example, for statin drugs, the NNH for muscle pain is 21, meaning one in every 21 patients may experience muscle pain.

A tutorial video linked below will help clarify the concepts of NNT and NNH, as well as illustrate how drug companies may legally misrepresent the benefits of their products through statistical jargon.

To illustrate, consider statin drugs. According to The NNT Group, the NNT for statins prescribed for five years to prevent heart disease in individuals without prior heart issues is 104. This means 104 people must take statins for five years to prevent one additional heart attack. Meanwhile, the NNH of 21 indicates that five out of those 104 patients will likely experience muscle loss.

It is alarming to note that when all causes of death from ADRs, adverse drug events (ADEs), medical procedures, and diagnostics are considered, medical care itself becomes a leading cause of death in America, surpassing heart disease and cancer.

The Statistics for Statin drugs is shown below as a verbatim quotation:

“In Summary, for those who received statins:

Benefits in NNT
No statistically significant mortality benefit
1 in 217 avoided a nonfatal heart attack (myocardial infarction)
1 in 313 avoided a nonfatal stroke

Harms in NNH
1 in 21 experienced pain from muscle damage
1 in 204 developed diabetes mellitus”

We often assume that conclusions about foods and medications from research studies are honest and accurate. Historically, most nutrition research was government-funded, with key organizations like the NIH in the U.S. and NIN in India. However, budget cuts in the 21st century have led to private industries, particularly food and Pharma, filling the funding gap. Medical and nutritional research can be categorized as follows:

(1) Primary Research 
Traditionally funded by the NIH, it focuses on broad public benefits like laboratory studies and randomized trials. Projects like the Human Genome and Human Proteome are still NIH-funded. However, a decrease in government funding has made this research less common.

(2) Applied Research
Applied research uses science to prevent and treat diseases. While some still receive NIH funding, much is now backed by pharma, food, and the supplement industries. It can be divided into research supporting various foods, justifying supplements, or showing harm in certain foods or lifestyles.

(3) Public Health Research
This aims to improve public health at a population level, ideally government-funded, though private industries are increasingly stepping in.

(4) Clinical research
Focused on testing medications, this research is primarily funded by pharmaceutical companies. Variability in how people respond to treatments (e.g., due to gut microbiomes) complicates results. For instance, if a drug helps 30% of participants in a placebo group and 70% in an experimental group, it’s deemed effective, leading to its prescription for all, even though 60% who either were not cured or cured only due to placebo effect, are still exposed to side effects without gaining any benefit. 

(5) Pharmacological Research
This field explores how chemicals interact with biological systems, playing a central role in pharmaceutical development. Some key points worth noting are:

5.1 The goal is not necessarily to cure diseases, as doing so could conflict with the long-term profitability of pharmaceutical companies.

5.2 Pharmaceutical companies often focus on managing health markers such as blood pressure, blood sugar, or cholesterol, which usually require increasing dosages over time.

5.3 These companies emphasize early detection, claiming it saves lives. While this is true for certain conditions like cancer, for most lifestyle diseases, it often leads to starting medication earlier. Additionally, they lobby to lower the thresholds for starting treatment, as seen with medications for blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol.

5.4 Pharmaceutical companies promote tighter control of these markers, often suggesting higher or more frequent dosages. For example, increasing the dosage from two to three pills a day represents a 50% increase in business. This approach influenced the ACCORD study (2001-2009). However, the study backfired, as it showed increased mortality rates in the experimental group, leading to its early termination.

Bias in Research
When we read research papers, we expect them to be honest and objective. However, various factors can distort this objectivity. Numerous studies have shown how research can be manipulated to favor the organization funding it. Some of these biases are summarized below. 

(1) Funding Bias
In the U.S., government funding for research has significantly declined over the past five decades. By 2021, private sources contributed $633 billion to research and development (R&D), while government funding amounted to just $76 billion. Private funding often comes with specific interests or conditions, and studies show that research funded by private sources rarely contradicts the interests of the sponsor. This can happen for several reasons:

- Research may be designed to avoid negative outcomes. For example, using the Standard American Diet (SAD) as a control can make almost any alternative diet seem healthier by comparison.

- In some cases, research design can obscure significant negative outcomes. For instance, one study asked college students to consume large amounts of white bread, and their health appeared to improve. However, concluding that white bread is healthy would be misleading, as the students had to reduce their intake of more harmful foods like eggs, sausages, and bacon. 

-Funders may cancel research midway if they realize the results will not favor them. To prevent this, a law was enacted requiring that research be registered with government authorities before it begins, ensuring it cannot be canceled midstream. However, this law is not always strictly enforced by bureaucrats who are hoping for a cozy consulting career upon retirement. 

- Before any research is published, a synopsis must be provided. Funders often manipulate this summary to downplay negative findings. A notable example is when Senator Bob Dole altered the language of George McGovern's 1977 dietary guidelines. Originally recommending reduced meat consumption, the guidelines were changed to encourage the consumption of lean meat. The two statements have entirely different implications.

(2) Myth Bias
Myths can skew researchers' judgment. For example, high protein intake was long recommended, despite evidence that excessive protein harms kidneys and liver. Similarly, the myth that plant protein is incomplete has been debunked, yet it persisted for years. 
The dairy industry perpetuated the idea that milk is the best calcium source, even when evidence suggested it could contribute to osteoporosis.

(3) Scholarly Pride Bias
Respected experts may distort findings to defend earlier positions. An example is Dr. Ancel Keys, whose *Seven Countries Study* promoted low-fat diets by excluding data from 15 countries that contradicted his hypothesis.

(4) Publication Bias
Positive outcomes are more likely to be published, skewing perceptions. Negative results often face reluctance in publication, leading to a distorted understanding of certain therapies.
For example, if three studies find that egg white therapy cures second-stage breast cancer, all three studies will likely get published. However, if seven subsequent studies show it does not, only one or two may be published. Future researchers may then mistakenly conclude the therapy is effective, leading to further studies based on flawed premises.

(5) Media Bias
Media prefers sensational stories, which can lead to biased reporting. The food and pharma industries, significant advertisers, influence the coverage, leading to overexposure of certain diet trends while scientifically sound approaches are underreported. For example, Dr. Atkins' high-protein, high-fat diet received more media coverage than Pritikin’s low-fat, high-carb approach, despite the latter being scientifically sounder. Sensational books like *Grain Brain* and *Wheat Belly* also received more coverage, influenced by powerful Food industry lobbies that support such narratives. Additionally, since the media relies heavily on advertising revenue from the food and pharmaceutical industries, they often hesitate to publish studies critical of these sectors.

(6) Government Bias
Government agencies often face conflicts of interest, as bureaucrats seek consulting jobs post-retirement, and elected officials raise funds from industries they regulate. 
The public relies on Government agencies like the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) to ensure that medical devices are safe.
There is an inherent conflict of interest within the drug and device approval process, as the FDA primarily depends on clinical trials conducted by the very companies that manufacture these products. Research findings are often ambiguous and open to debate. The FDA has, at times, approved drugs and devices despite objections from its own staff. This recently came to light on a device called MitraClip made by Abbott Labs to fix leaky heart valves that was approved by the FDA in 2013. Over 17,000 reports have been filed complaining about this device. 

(7) Other Conflicts of Interest 
Political, personal ambitions, and other conflicts can further complicate the research landscape.

Conclusion
It’s crucial to approach research with caution. Understanding potential biases, especially the source of funding, helps reveal the full story behind the findings. Always scrutinize before accepting conclusions.

[10/25/25, 6:51:24 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Role of Government & Media•

We’ve discussed how wealthy industries like Food, Pharma, and Health Care influence the information we receive. Now, let’s examine the roles of Government and Media. By “government,” I mean both elected politicians and bureaucrats.

Politicians need funding to win elections every 4-5 years, and that money often comes from wealthy industries, so it’s natural for them to support industry interests. Lobbyists work closely with politicians’ staff to ensure this support is secured. 

Meanwhile, bureaucrats often seek well-paid positions post-retirement, and there are plenty of opportunities within the food and pharma industries to accommodate them. Consequently, many senior officials are willing to accommodate lobbyists’ requests. All they need is some science to justify their actions, which researchers—often industry-funded—readily provide.

Let’s now consider educational institutions, where much of the research is conducted. Imagine you are applying for a Ph.D. program at a leading U.S. university and need financial assistance. This assistance might come from, say, a soft drink manufacturer eager to fund research showing that consuming sugary sodas in moderation can be part of a balanced diet. The company provides funding annually. By the end of the first year, if your research findings are negative, the project might be canceled, and funding cut. This situation encourages researchers to use careful language in reports and potentially manipulate data to achieve favorable outcomes. 

The data isn’t falsified, but choosing specific words or omitting data can still lead to misleading conclusions. Once published in a medical journal, the research paper includes an abstract. Doctors often only read the abstract, so lobbyists work hard to influence the language used here. Professor J. P. Rivers of the Department of Human Nutrition, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, observed:

	“The dispassionate objectivity of scientists is a myth. No scientist is simply involved in the single-minded pursuit of truth; they are also engaged in the passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success.”

Role of Media
Now, let’s talk about the role of media and medical journals. Editors have various options for each issue and can select whichever articles they prefer. 

Most published media rely on advertising revenue for their income. The proceeds from magazine sales alone don’t even cover the cost of publication. The largest advertisers are often the big food and pharmaceutical industries. Therefore, it is natural for publishers to avoid controversial content that might jeopardize their relationships with advertisers.

Another factor to consider is article reprints. For example, if you like an article in a magazine like TIME, you can purchase reprints for about $3–5 each. The cover page shows the magazine cover, but inside, only the article you requested is included.

Imagine you’re an editor, deciding which health articles to include in the next issue. A dairy industry lobbyist approaches you and suggests that if you publish an article supporting the health benefits of butter, he’ll order half a million reprints to distribute to doctors across the U.S. What would you choose as the editor? That order could bring in nearly a million dollars in extra revenue for the magazine, and if your compensation includes profit-sharing, it could result in a substantial bonus for you.

It’s important to understand that this scenario isn’t a conspiracy. No laws are broken, and there’s no bribery involved. However, the consumer ends up misled, and situations like this happen every day. Posted below as an example is the issue of TIME magazine zone I’m referring to.👇

[10/25/25, 6:51:26 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: WHO & SUGAR
In 1776, when the United States gained independence, Americans consumed about 4 pounds of sugar per person annually—about 5 grams daily. By 1850, this had increased to 20 pounds per person, and by 1994, it reached 120 pounds. Over the past half-century, the food industry has increasingly used sugar to sweeten foods and beverages, often substituting it with high-fructose corn syrup, which is cheaper and widely available in the U.S. When efforts are made to limit sugar use, the industry often responds with resistance and pressure to halt those initiatives. Margaret Chan, Director-General of the World Health Organization, summarized this challenge:

"One of the biggest challenges facing health promotion worldwide is that efforts to prevent our top killers 'go against the business interests of Big Food, Big Soda, and Big Alcohol'"

Please watch the YouTube video titled “Big Sugar Takes on the World Health Organization” to understand how, in 2003, the U.S. government—under pressure from the sugar lobby—threatened to stop funding the WHO unless they changed the language of their guidelines on sugar consumption.

[10/25/25, 6:51:32 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••US Government, Protein Myth and Objectivity in Nutritional Research•••

Following are quotes from a paper written by UC Berkeley’s Nutrition science professor Kenneth J. Carpenter,  titled “The History of Enthusiasm for Protein”.

“In the 1890s USDA recommended over 110 grams of dietary protein per day for working men. This was based on Liebig’s idea that protein was the source of muscular energy and the observation that protein consumption was higher in the more successful (i.e. affluent) social groups or nations than elsewhere.”

“After the 1939-45 war dry skim milk became available in the USA as a “fortune by-product of a domestic surplus-product problem”. It was clearly more satisfactory in every respect to dump it in the developing countries than to have to burry it in the US, as was contemplated by the Department of Agriculture at one point.”

India definitely got it’s share of this milk powder as I am myself witness to that. The program was called “Food for Peace” and later became known as USAID PL-480. 
A non profit eye hospital my father headed received it’s share of such aid. I mention this only to emphasize how mistaken the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was at the time and how it played a role in propagating the protein myth. 110 grams of protein is triple of what we now know to be the true requirement of protein. The following video by Dr. Greger puts it in an interesting perspective. It also highlights how scientists loose objectivity in their passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success. The subject I cover in great detail in the posts during fourth week of the course in the health groups.

In a paper written by Professor J. P. Rivers of Departmentof Human Nutrition, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, he says:

“The dispassionate objectivity of scientists is a myth. No scientist is simply involved in the single-minded pursuit of truth, he is also engaged in the passionate pursuit of research grants and professional success.”

[10/26/25, 7:03:39 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• Misleading Ads by Egg Industry •••

Since eggs are the highest source of cholesterol in diet the industry faces a challenge as to how to combat the increasing resistance to egg consumption. The industry resorted to false and misleading advertising and during mid 1990s the Federal Trade Commission carried out a successful legal action which was upheld by the Supreme Court to compel the egg industry to desist from false and misleading advertising that eggs had no harmful effects on health. 
The following two videos on the subject show how desperate the industry became and why they can’t claim eggs to be healthy or even safe according to the US government. 👇

[10/26/25, 7:03:44 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Pharma companies extracted USD 2 trillion from consumers in the name of cholesterol level treatment.

What a shame on medical research fraud and authorities. Their incompetency costed USD 2 trillion to people those who were fit and healthy. 

*Cholesterol* is finally officially removed from Naughty List. The  US government has finally accepted that *cholesterol* is not a _nutrient of concern_. *doing a U-turn* on their warnings to us to stay away from high-cholesterol foods since the 1970s to avoid heart disease and clogged arteries.

This means full-fat dairy products, nuts, coconut oil have now been classified as *safe* and have been officially removed from the _nutrients of concern_ list.

The US Department of Agriculture, which is responsible for updating the guidelines every five years, stated in its findings for 2015: "Previously, the Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that cholesterol intake be limited to no more than 300 mg/day.

"The 2015 DGAC will not bring forward this recommendation because available evidence shows no appreciable relationship between consumption of dietary cholesterol and serum (blood) cholesterol, consistent with the AHA/ACC (American Heart Association / American College of Cardiology)

The Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee will, in response, no longer warn people against eating high-cholesterol foods and will instead focus on *sugar as the main substance of dietary concern*.

US cardiologist Dr Steven Nissen said: _It's the right decision_. _We got the dietary guidelines wrong. They've been wrong for decades_."

When we eat more foods rich in this compound, our bodies make less. If we deprive ourselves of foods high in cholesterol  - our body revs up. 

The Real Truth about Cholesterol. The majority of the cholesterol in you is produced by your liver. Your brain is primarily made up from cholesterol. It is essential for nerve cells to function. 

Cholesterol is the basis for the creation of all the steroid hormones, including estrogen, testosterone, and corticosteroids. 

*High cholesterol in the body is a clear indication which shows the liver of the individual is in good health.*

Dr. George V. Mann M.D. associate director of the Framingham study for the incidence and prevalence of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and its risk factors states:
 _Saturated fats and cholesterol in the diet are not the cause of coronary heart disease. *That myth is the greatest deception of the century, perhaps of any century*_

*Cholesterol is the biggest medical scam of all time*
There is no such thing as *bad Cholesterol*

So you can stop trying to change your Cholesterol level. Studies prove beyond a doubt, cholesterol doesn't cause heart disease and it won't stop a heart attack.

*The majority of people that have heart attacks have normal cholesterol levels.*

OUR BODY NEEDS 950 mg OF CHOLESTEROL FOR DAILY METABOLISM AND THE LIVER IS THE MAIN Producer. ONLY 15% OF CHOLESTEROL IS BEING DONATED BY THE FOOD WE EAT. 

If the fat content is less in our food we eat, our liver
Got to work more to maintain the level at 950 mg.

*If the cholesterol level is high in our body, it shows the liver is working perfect.*

Experts say that there is nothing like LDL or HDL. 
…………..
….. *Cholesterol is not found to create block any where in human body*. 

Please share the recent facts about CHOLESTEROL

•Eggs & Cholesterol•

The above news article is from 2015 and many people have been sending it to me for comments so I decided to write this post. This is a testament to what I teach in my course wher I spend a full week covering the politics of health which explains: 
1. How over 94% of the research, being conducted today, is funded by the food industry. The findings from these research have a way of being complementary to the industry funding the research. 
2. The research does not have to prove a point; it only needs to create enough doubt. 
3. The media likes to create sensation to sell more news. 
4. There is a nexus of food, Pharma and health care industries and government and media, which helps propagate confusing information deliberately composed by the researchers so as not to offend other industries but achieve the goal. 
5. The charter of Food & Drug Administration is to help the industry and they are always eager to do that. 

The egg industry had been hurt by the previous FDA guidelines on recommended daily allowance for cholesterol, because even half the egg exceeded those guidelines. 
An upper limit of 199 for total cholesterol had fueled the growth of Statin drugs and made it a $15 billion market. 
Egg industry dare not disturb the Pharma business. So they funded research that showed that when you eat food rich in cholesterol your body makes less of it (something we have known all along). Ten of the eleven studies, used by the FDA were funded by the egg industry. FDA accepted this evidence and reversed their position on cholesterol, removing it as a nutrient of concern. However while doing so they dare not hurt the Pharma industry so they did not change the upper limit on cholesterol of 199 which should have been done. THIS IS HOW YOU EAT YOUR CAKE AND EAT IT TOO. 

In my posts on cholesterol I have always maintained that 
1. There is no causation between high cholesterol and heart disease, only association is there. To restrict cholesterol under 200 hundred is flawed. 
2. Statin drugs cause more harm than good. The numbers needed to avoid a non fatal heart attack (NNH) is 217 and to save a non fatal stroke is 313. But statin drugs harm many more people and numbers needed to harm (NNH) by muscle damage is only 21.
3. Egg (and other animal foods)  is not harmful because it has cholesterol, it is harmful because it causes inflammation which is the leading cause of all cardio vascular diseases. 
I hope now you know the rest of the Story.
[10/26/25, 7:03:45 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: I just noticed that I missed posting during week 2 my oatmeal recipe. It is highly recommended for breakfast. Here it is.👇
[10/26/25, 7:03:46 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •• My Oatmeal Recipe ••

Oatmeal is one of the best grains for breakfast. It is rich in fiber, low in glycemic and insulin load, and keeps you full for an extended period. I recommend it to everyone, especially diabetics.

Here is my recipe for two servings:
1. 4 tbsp steel-cut oats
2. 2 tsp ground flaxseed
3. 1 tsp chia seeds
4. 1 tsp sesame seeds
5. 2 or 3 dates
6. 1 tbsp raisins
7. 1/4 cup almond milk
8. 5 walnuts
9. 1/4 tsp ground cardamom (ilaychi)
10. 1/2 tsp cinnamon
11. 1/2 cup sliced banana, blueberries, mango, or any fruit of your choice

Instructions:
Combine the first 7 ingredients with 2 cups of water and bring to a boil. Simmer for 10–15 minutes. Once cooked, add the cardamom, cinnamon, walnuts, and fruits.

This breakfast is a great way to meet your daily needs for nuts, seeds, and omega-3s. It tastes delicious and, when paired with a glass of green juice and a bowl of fruit, it covers two additional food groups for the day.

[10/27/25, 6:30:02 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: ••• EARLY DETECTION VS PREVENTION •••

Another area of concern is the strong emphasis in modern medicine—and especially on social media—on early detection of disease. We are constantly told to go for regular screenings to catch conditions like cancer early. Self-monitoring is also heavily promoted.

But here’s the irony: while early detection gets all the attention, prevention gets almost none. This is especially unfortunate because most lifestyle diseases—such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity, and some cancers—are entirely preventable through diet and lifestyle modifications. Yet, articles and campaigns promoting such prevention are rare.

Why? Because there is no money in prevention. It threatens the profits of:
- the processed food and animal agriculture industries,
- healthcare providers who benefit from treating chronic disease,
- and the pharmaceutical industry that sells lifelong medications.

Early detection, on the surface, sounds like a good idea. But it implicitly accepts disease as inevitable. The far better approach is to prevent disease from arising in the first place. Unfortunately, if everyone started living healthier lives, many industries—processed food, animal products, hospitals, and drug companies—would take a financial hit.

To be clear, this doesn’t mean there’s an organized conspiracy. But it does raise an important question: Why is prevention being ignored?

Some leaders in the medical field have spoken out. Dr. Neal Barnard, for instance, founded the organization “Doctors Against Irresponsible Medicine”, which promotes prevention through lifestyle medicine. The American Board of Internal Medicine has also launched a campaign called “Choosing Wisely”, encouraging patients and doctors to question unnecessary treatments and focus on evidence-based practices.

Consumers need to be aware of this built-in bias. The system heavily favors early detection over prevention, not because it’s better for patients, but because it’s better for business.

It’s time we shift our focus from managing disease to eliminating its causes. True health comes not from pills or early tests, but from the daily choices we make around food, movement, and lifestyle.

[10/28/25, 6:39:31 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: UNNECESSARY TESTS

I previously discussed that what is “normal” for one group of people may not be the same for another—especially when comparing non-vegetarians and vegans. For example, prescribing medication or supplements to a vegan simply because a blood parameter falls outside the normal range can be misguided. It’s essential to consider other factors in such cases.

Similarly, advising people to undergo numerous tests without cause is not prudent. Tests should be conducted only when there is reason to suspect something may be wrong and when a patient has reported symptoms.

This issue has been debated in the United States for some time. As a result of this debate a foundation was created by the American Board of Internal Medicine (ABIM) with the primary purpose of improving public health. The mission statement on their website is:

“To advance the core values of medical professionalism as a force to improve the quality of health care.”

Programs supporting this work include the 
*Choosing Wisely®️ campaign,
*“Teaching Value and Choosing Wisely Challenge”, 
*  “Putting Stewardship into Medical Education and Training” grant program.

Of these, “Choosing Wisely” is of special interest to us. The goal of this campaign is to promote conversations between clinicians and patients by helping patients choose care that is:
* Supported by evidence
* Not duplicative of other tests or procedures already received
* Free from harm
* Truly necessary

It calls upon leading medical specialty societies and other organizations to identify tests or procedures commonly used in their field whose necessity should be questioned and discussed with patients. Doctors are often criticized for prescribing unneeded tests and procedures that harm more than they help and add to medical costs that could otherwise be avoided. 

Since the campaign was launched in 2012, more than 400 tests and procedures have been called into question by 70 medical specialty societies with more than half a million member doctors. “Millions of Americans are increasingly realizing that when it comes to health care, more is not necessarily better,” said Dr. Christine Cassel, president of the ABIM Foundation. “Through these lists of tests and procedures, we hope to encourage conversations between physicians and patients about what care they truly need.”

Twelve medical tests and procedures are now being questioned worldwide as unnecessary and potentially cause some harmful results to patients are listed below. 

12 Medical Tests to Avoid

1. Avoid Inducing Labor or having a C-Section Before 39 Weeks:
Deliveries before 39 weeks are associated with increased risks of learning disabilities, respiratory issues, and other complications. While early delivery is sometimes necessary, the recommendation is clear: a mature fetal lung test alone, without other medical reasons, is not enough to justify delivery before 39 weeks. 
(American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologist; American Academy of Family Physicians) 

2. Avoid Routine Annual Pap Tests:
For women at average risk, annual Pap tests (cervical cytology screenings) do not offer added benefits over less frequent screening. (American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists)

3. Avoid CT Scans To Evaluate Minor Head Injuries:
About half of children who visit emergency departments for head injuries receive a CT scan, exposing them to radiation that can increase future cancer risk. These scans involve radiation levels approximately 100 times that of a standard chest X-ray. Observation should precede any decision about CT scanning. (American Academy of Pediatrics)

4. Avoid Stress Tests Using Echocardiographic Images:
For asymptomatic individuals, stress echocardiography adds limited value in assessing cardiovascular risk and may not justify its use. (American Society of Echocardiography)

5. Avoid Prescribing Type 2 Diabetes Medication To Achieve Tight Glycemic Control:
For older adults with Type 2 diabetes, there is no evidence that strict blood sugar control improves health outcomes. In fact, it may lead to higher mortality rates. (American Geriatrics Society)

6. Avoid EEGs (electroencephalography) on Patients With Recurrent Headaches:
Recurrent headaches affect up to 20% of people. However, EEGs provide no diagnostic advantage over a clinical evaluation, do not improve treatment outcomes, and add unnecessary costs. (American Academy of Neurology)

7. Avoid Routinely Treating Acid Reflux:
Anti-reflux medications, while common for adults with GERD, are not effective for reducing symptoms in infants and may even cause harm in certain cases. (Society of Hospital Medicine)

8. Avoid Lipid Profile Tests:
The lipid profile test checks cholesterol and triglyceride levels.
Several scientific papers have proven that people with high so-called “bad” LDL cholesterol live the longest and there is now a large number of findings that contradict the lipid hypothesis that cholesterol has to be lowered at all. 

9. Avoid Mammograms:
Mammograms and breast screening have had no impact on breast cancer deaths and have actually been found to increase breast cancer mortality. With toxic radiation, mammogram testing compresses sensitive breast tissue causing pain and possible tissue damage. To make matters worse, the false negative and false positive rates of mammography are a troubling 30% and 89% respectively. Another concern is that many breast cancers occur below the armpits; however, mammography completely misses this auxiliary region, viewing only the breast tissue compressed between two plates of glass. Considering these drawbacks, breast thermography should be given closer consideration. Thermography is a non-invasive and non-toxic technique which can detect abnormalities before the ons no et of a malignancy, and as early as ten years before being recognized by mammography. This makes it much safer and potentially life-saving health test for women who are unknowingly developing abnormalities, as it can take several years for a cancerous tumor to develop and be detected by a mammogram. 

10. Avoid PSA Testing:
A PSA blood test looks for prostate-specific antigen, a protein produced by the prostate gland. High levels are supposedly associated with prostate cancer. The problem is that the association isn’t always correct, and when it is, the prostate cancer isn’t necessarily deadly. Nearly 20 percent of men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer, which sounds scary, but only about 3 percent of all men die from it. The PSA test usually leads to overdiagnosis — biopsies and treatment in which the side effects are impotence and incontinence. Moreover, there is some evidence which suggests that biopsies and treatment actually aggravate prostate cancer. During a needle biopsy, a tumor may need to be punctured several times to retrieve an amount of tissue that’s adequate enough to be screened. It is believed that this repeated penetration may spread cancer cells into the track formed by the needle, or by spilling cancerous cells directly into the bloodstream or lympathic system. 

11. Avoid Routine Colorectal Cancer Screening:
Colorectal cancer screening often results in unnecessary removal of benign polyps which are of no threat to patients and the risks of their treatment or removal far exceed any benefit. The evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of computed tomographic colonography and fecal DNA testing as screening modalities for colorectal cancer. 

12. Avoid Dual Energy X-Ray Absorptiometry (DEXA or DXA): 
This technique developed in the 1980s that measures, among many things, bone mineral density. The scans can determine bone strength and signs of osteopenia, a possible precursor to osteoporosis. Limitations abound, though. Measurements vary from scan to scan of the same person, as well as from machine to machine. DEXA doesn’t capture the collagen-to-mineral ratio, which is more predictive of bone strength than just mineral density. And higher bone mineral density doesn’t necessarily mean stronger bones, for someone with more bone mass will have more minerals but could have weaker bones.

The ABIM initiative to reduce unnecessary testing is commendable, though it has received limited media coverage. Ideally, information on these recommendations would be displayed in clinic waiting rooms for patients to see.

I encourage everyone to understand these recommendations and make informed decisions. While these tests may still be needed in certain situations, it is wise to discuss your options with your doctor or consider a second opinion before proceeding.

[10/28/25, 6:39:31 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •••    MY STORY   •••

Today, I’d like to share a personal story of how I became interested in healthy eating and lifestyle, the sources of information I rely on, and my approach to research.

Like many people, I used to believe that my diet and lifestyle were healthy and that my chronic illnesses were largely due to genetics. My dad and his brothers all had heart issues, hypertension, and diabetes. Two of them passed away from heart attacks in their 40s and 50s. I didn’t smoke, and my alcohol intake was limited to a few margaritas on weekends. We were mostly vegetarian, only having meat or seafood when eating out or at gatherings. I drank a lot of milk and loved eggs, convinced they were good for me. My morning and evening tea was made mostly of milk, which I took pride in. In the summer, I enjoyed cold coffee, mango milkshakes, and Rooh Afza lassi. Most mornings, I had either fried eggs or avocado masala omelettes with parathas.

After graduating from IITK in 1971, my BMI was 22.7. I was a weightlifter and bodybuilder, even winning third-place prizes in these categories. However, over the years, my BMI gradually increased to 30.4 by the age 62. At 47, I started medication for gout. At 50, I began BP medication, and by 51, I was on diabetes medication, starting with Metformin. Within three years
Avandia, another diabetes medication, was added which was later replaced with Actos due to cardiac risks. Later, Actos was banned for similar reasons. At 54, I started thyroid medication, and by 58, I was diagnosed with sleep apnea and advised to use a CPAP machine due to loud snoring. My snoring was so loud that nobody could share a room with me at night and my wife had to use ear plugs. 

Our meals were largely vegetarian but high in ghee. Growing up, our meals were divided into “Kachcha Khana” and “Pakka Khana.” Lunch typically consisted of daal, roti, subji, curd, and rice, while dinner included parathis, curried potatoes, other vegetables, and curd. In the evenings, we always had snacks with tea.

In March 2012, Swami Ishwarananda of Chinmaya Mission West, with whom I was closely involved, stayed overnight at our home and requested steel cut oatmeal for breakfast. We happily prepared it, and that became the first conscious change I made to my diet. To my surprise, I began losing 1.5 pounds a month without trying, likely due to other subtle changes I’d started making unconsciously. That’s the beauty of intentional change—it often leads to other positive habits.

On January 1, 2013, we decided to put to use the Christmas gifts from our daughters: an Apple TV and a Netflix subscription. The first documentary we watched was “Happy”, and soon after, we found “Forks Over Knives”. Since we were food lovers, we decided to watch it, and that sparked my interest in health documentaries. We watched “Fat, Sick, and Nearly Dead” and immediately ordered an Angel juicer. We joined a farm cooperative that delivered fresh organic produce twice a week, went on a three-day juice fast, adopted a vegan diet, and cut down on oil and sugar. My wife, who loves cooking, started experimenting with oil-free recipes. 

South Indian dishes like idli and uttapam, as well as Gujarati snacks like dhokla, handwa, and muthia, became household favorites. Tadka in our meals was replaced with chaunka (reducing ghee from 45 grams to 9 grams). Oil-based salad dressings were swapped for balsamic vinegar or lemon-ginger-honey-mustard, and we developed new soup recipes. We also adopted a practice of drinking green juice before each meal.

At the time, I wasn’t aware of the benefits of intermittent or prolonged fasting—that came after the 2016 Nobel Prize in Physiology. Our weekend parties still included oil and sugar, but I started noticing immediate, visible weight loss, which others commented on. My doctors, however, were cautious and encouraged me to stay on my medications. Over the next few years, I gradually phased out my medications: BP medication within 6 months, gout medication in one year, and diabetes medication took two years because of consistently high fasting glucose levels. Eventually, I also stopped my thyroid medication. My confidencte grew as friends and family noticed my changes, and soon, many of them bought green juicers, too.

In September 2017, I formed my first WhatsApp group with my IITK ’71 batchmates. Milk and curd were the most controversial topics but, over time, some members also started following and noticed improvements. New groups formed, expanding our collective knowledge and experience.

To stay motivated, I started watching health documentaries and YouTube videos daily, learning from doctors and medical researchers. In 2015, I began attending Advanced Study weekend seminars organized by Dr. John McDougall in Santa Rosa, where I met experts like Dr. T. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. Michael Greger and others all of whom were very helpful in answering questions. In 2016 I began experimenting with intermittent fasting, followed by prolonged fasting in 2019.

Besides seminars, documentaries, and YouTube lectures, my primary sources of information are PubMed, books, and Google. PubMed has been invaluable for access to research on various health topics. Being retired, I had the time to dedicate 20-30 hours a week to this research, with a strong motivation to prove my doctors wrong—and I did. Now, I spend even more time on the subject.

Different doctors in the plant-based, whole-foods (PBWF) movement have varying opinions. I had to choose among them and prioritize on my own. I drew heavily from my Indian cultural heritage. These decisions are mine alone and are reinforced by personal experiences and feedback from others who follow me. 

For example, Dr. Jason Fung advocates a keto diet with intermittent fasting, while PBWF doctors strongly oppose keto. Dr. Greger and Dr. Campbell support eating nuts, while Dr. Esselstyn is against it, especially for patients with critical heart conditions. Dr. McDougall focuses on starch, while Dr. Joel Fuhrman emphasizes fruits and vegetables. True North Health Center doctors, like Dr. Goldhammer and Dr. Klaper, focus on fasting therapy, though they have not yet introduced dry fasting as recommended by Nobel laureates Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi (2016) and Dr. Tasuku Honjo (2018).

I believe that by following these changes precisely and incorporating fasting, one can achieve similar results in much less time than I did. Many members of my health groups have reported success. I encourage everyone, especially those hesitant to begin, to make significant changes for just three weeks and see the results. You’ll feel better, and others will notice as well.  If you make only minor changes, the results will also be minor and if you are a skeptic you will not connect the two and fall back. 

My Teachers: Doctors I Follow
Here’s a partial list of doctors I’ve learned from, and I highly recommend watching their videos on YouTube:

1. Dr. Collin Campbell 
2. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn 
3. Dr. John McDougall
4. Dr. Michael Greger
5. Dr. Dean Ornish
6. Dr. Neil Bernard
7. Dr. Janice Stanger
8. Dr. Robert Lustig
9. Dr. B.M.Hegde
10. Dr. Satchin Panda 

These doctors don’t always agree with each other 100%, but I align most closely with Dr. Colin Campbell, who was influenced by Dr. Gopalan of the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad. Recently, Dr. Hemalatha, the previous director of this institute, has agreed to join my Plant-Based Wellness (PBW) Foundation, for which I’m deeply grateful.

In 2021, I founded two NGOs by the name PBW Foundation in the U.S. and India. Last year, a company, PBW Foods Pvt. Ltd., was started that launched its first Experiential Center in Cyber City. All the promoters’ equity has been donated to the foundation, making it a 50% partner. Our aim is to provide healthy foods like fresh green juices, nut milks, yogurts, butters, naturally sweetened beverages, and whole grain and seed breads throughout India and, eventually, worldwide. The foundation offers free courses and lectures across India, the U.S., and other English-speaking countries. This year (2024) the number of students who have completed my course has surpassed 250,000 and virtual groups span over 50 cities worldwide. Thank you all for your participation.

[10/29/25, 6:56:04 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: WHY WHOLE FOOD?
Lack of Fiber Question

The lack of fiber in refined sugar causes it to be absorbed rapidly in the intestines, overwhelming the liver. The liver converts the fructose portion into fat, leading to fatty liver (NAFLD), visceral fat, and insulin resistance by interfering with insulin signaling in muscle cells.

To explain this concept visually, I often show a short clip from Lucy in the Chocolate Factory (watch here).

https://youtu.be/AnHiAWlrYQc?si=sMCMxEmYv-AvU-un

In the video, when chocolates arrive at a comfortable pace, Lucy wraps them neatly and sends them down the conveyor belt to the shipping department — everything works smoothly. But when the belt speeds up, chaos ensues: the chocolates end up in the wrong places — her mouth, her hat, and even her blouse!

Our liver works in much the same way. When sugar enters the bloodstream slowly (as it does when we eat whole fruits, which contain fiber), the liver can manage it efficiently. But when sugar arrives too quickly — as in fruit juice or processed sweets — the liver becomes overwhelmed. Instead of packaging fructose into fat for safe storage in subcutaneous fat cells (under the skin), it diverts it to unhealthy destinations: liver fat, visceral fat, and intramyocellular fat (inside muscle cells). These misplaced fats cause a cascade of problems, including NAFLD, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes.

All this can happen simply because someone chose apple juice instead of an apple.

The Question

This raises an intriguing question:

If refined sugar (devoid of fiber) can cause such damage, what about refined fats (like oils) and refined proteins (like meat, dairy, and eggs) — which are also devoid of fiber?

The Answer

Let’s unpack this carefully.
When we examine refined fats and refined proteins, the mechanisms differ from refined sugar — but the metabolic consequences are surprisingly similar. When these nutrients are consumed without the natural fiber, phytonutrients, and water found in whole plant foods, they too overload our metabolic systems.

1. Refined Fats (Oils, Ghee, Butter, etc.)

Refined fats are essentially pure triglycerides extracted from whole foods like nuts, seeds, or olives — stripped of fiber, antioxidants, and other protective compounds.

Key consequences:
   •   Rapid absorption and extreme calorie density:
Oils are absorbed almost instantly and are the most calorie-dense foods on Earth (9 kcal/g). Even small amounts can create a large caloric surplus, promoting weight gain and visceral fat accumulation.
   •   Fat accumulation in liver and muscle:
Excess dietary fat — especially saturated and omega-6–rich oils — infiltrates liver (hepatocytes) and muscle cells (myocytes), leading to hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) and lipotoxicity.
   •   Insulin resistance:
Intracellular fat disrupts insulin signaling, reducing glucose uptake and increasing blood sugar and insulin levels — the same end result seen with sugar overload.
   •   Inflammation:
Many refined oils (corn, sunflower, safflower, etc.) are rich in omega-6 fatty acids, which promote inflammatory compounds that worsen insulin resistance and damage blood vessels.

So yes — refined fats can indeed lead to fatty liver, visceral obesity, and insulin resistance, just through fat overload instead of fructose overload.

2. Refined Proteins (Meat, Eggs, Dairy)

Though not “refined” in the industrial sense, animal-based foods are naturally devoid of fiber and phytonutrients, and often high in saturated fat and amino acids (like methionine and leucine) that alter metabolic pathways.

Key consequences:
   •   Lack of fiber:
Without fiber, there’s no buffering of nutrient absorption, no support for gut microbes, and no binding of bile acids. This increases the metabolic burden on the liver and kidneys and promotes gut dysbiosis.
   •   Fatty liver and insulin resistance:
Animal proteins often come packaged with saturated fat, contributing directly to hepatic fat accumulation. High intake of certain amino acids (especially branched-chain amino acids) activates the mTOR pathway, which interferes with insulin signaling and promotes insulin resistance.
   •   Increased visceral fat:
Chronic insulin resistance caused by animal-based diets drives hyperinsulinemia, which promotes fat storage, particularly around abdominal organs.

Epidemiological studies consistently link high consumption of red and processed meats with NAFLD, type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome.

3. The Unifying Concept: Fiber and Nutrient Synergy

Fiber is not just a bulking agent — it’s a metabolic protector.

It:
   •   Slows absorption of glucose, fats, and amino acids, preventing overload.
   •   Feeds gut bacteria, which produce short-chain fatty acids (like butyrate) that improve insulin sensitivity and protect the liver.
   •   Binds bile acids and fats, reducing lipid absorption and cholesterol levels.

When fiber is missing — whether from refined sugar, refined fat, or animal protein — metabolic overload follows. The result is lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, inflammation, and ultimately insulin resistance.

In essence, fiber and phytonutrient synergy is nature’s way of ensuring that the body receives nutrients at a pace it can handle — just like Lucy wrapping chocolates at a steady, manageable speed. Remove the fiber, and metabolic chaos begins.

Additional Perspectives

When we try to understand something that isn’t yet clear to us, it helps to view it from multiple perspectives. My post yesterday on “Why Whole Food” focused on how the presence of fiber slows the absorption of food in the small intestine, preventing many lifestyle diseases. Today, let’s explore a few other perspectives.

(1) Time Available for Food Absorption

Another important factor is the amount of time food remains in the small intestine for absorption.
Whole, fiber-rich foods move through the intestines more quickly, allowing less time for absorption. This has two important consequences:
* Reduced calorie absorption: Fewer calories are absorbed into the body, helping maintain a healthy weight.
* Enhanced gut health: More undigested food reaches the colon, providing nourishment for beneficial gut bacteria. These microbes flourish and, in turn, produce essential nutrients such as vitamins and short-chain fatty acids that strengthen immunity and overall health.

A good example of this is resistant starch found in beans. Because it resists absorption in the small intestine, it leads to a lower glycemic spike during the meal itself — less glucose enters the bloodstream since less starch is absorbed. In addition, when this resistant starch reaches the colon, it feeds beneficial bacteria that further improve metabolic health, a phenomenon known as the second meal effect.

Leaky Gut Syndrome

When food is refined and stripped of fiber, it moves slowly through the intestines, allowing nearly all calories to be absorbed before reaching the colon. This leaves the gut bacteria starved. In response, they begin consuming the mucin layer that protects the intestinal lining, eventually damaging the epithelial barrier — a condition known as leaky gut.

Leaky gut allows harmful substances to enter the bloodstream and is believed to be a root cause of many autoimmune diseases. Over 80 such conditions have been identified, including hypothyroidism, arthritis, and lupus — and the number continues to rise.

(2) The Protective Skin of Plants

The outer skin of plant foods not only protects the plant itself but is also rich in phytochemicals and antioxidants that nourish our gut microbiome. When we consume refined foods that lack these protective layers, our gut microbes are deprived of vital nutrients — and consequently, our bodies are deprived of the many beneficial compounds those microbes produce.

It is estimated that our microbiome may generate up to half of the chemicals required for human health — a staggering reminder of how deeply we depend on these microbial partners.

A Note of Humility

Many senior nutrition scientists agree that our understanding of nutrition is still in its infancy — there is far more we don’t know than what we do. Recognizing this, we should act with humility and choose what nature has already perfected over millions of years: whole foods.

Forming the habit of eating whole, unprocessed foods is not difficult, especially when begun early in life. The habits children form when young often last a lifetime — and choosing whole foods is one of the most powerful habits we can pass on to the next generation.

[10/29/25, 6:56:06 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Healthy vs Unhealthy •

A common question that keeps coming up is: “Is this food healthy?”
We also frequently encounter media articles comparing one food with another, making claims such as:
	1.	Jaggery is healthy
	2.	Red Wine is healthy
	3.	Olive Oil is healthy

These comparisons often confuse people because they blur the crucial difference between something being healthy and something being healthier.

Let’s get this straight:
Just because one food is less harmful than another doesn’t automatically make it healthy. Being “healthier” is a relative concept—it only means it’s the lesser evil when compared to something worse. That doesn’t qualify it as beneficial or safe for regular consumption. Let’s look at the three examples mentioned above:

1. Jaggery vs Refined Sugar

Jaggery is often marketed as a traditional, “natural” sweetener with supposed health benefits. Articles tout it as rich in minerals like iron and magnesium. But here’s the catch—they’re always comparing it to refined white sugar.

Sure, if your only two options are jaggery and refined sugar, jaggery is the slightly better choice. But that does not mean it is healthy. It’s still a concentrated form of sugar and will still spike your blood glucose, burden your liver, and contribute to insulin resistance.

If you’ve already managed to eliminate added sugars from your diet and are getting all the sugar you need from fruits and vegetables, please don’t go back and “reward” yourself by adding jaggery. That would be a step backward, not forward.

Want something truly better? Eat sugarcane. It has fiber, water, and micronutrients. Much less damaging than jaggery—which is, in essence, boiled-down, dehydrated sugarcane juice minus all the good stuff.

2. Red Wine vs Other Alcohols

Red wine often gets glowing coverage in lifestyle magazines and health columns. The reason? It contains resveratrol, a plant compound with antioxidant properties that has shown some promise in lab studies.

But let’s be clear: that doesn’t make red wine a health food. It is still alcohol, a known toxin that damages the liver, increases cancer risk, and impairs brain function over time.

So why the good press? It’s all about context. The studies compare red wine to other alcoholic beverages. So, in that narrow context, red wine emerges as the least harmful. If you are absolutely forced to choose between red wine, white wine, and scotch (say, you’re kidnapped and only these three are on offer—no water, no tea, no coconut water), go with red wine. At least it brings along a few antioxidants for the ride.

But if you don’t already drink alcohol, please don’t start—not for the resveratrol, not for “heart health,” not for social status. Even the World Health Organization is crystal clear on this: no level of alcohol consumption is completely safe.

Want resveratrol? Eat a handful of red grapes. Or better still, eat a bowl of berries, which are even richer in health-protective phytonutrients—without the alcohol, of course.

3. Olive Oil vs Other Oils

Many health-conscious Indians have now adopted extra virgin olive oil, believing it’s a “healthy fat.” The marketing works beautifully: words like “cold-pressed,” “extra virgin,” and even “Mediterranean diet” all paint olive oil as a miracle elixir.

But here’s the inconvenient truth: Olive oil is not healthy.
It’s just less harmful than things like butter, lard, or hydrogenated oils. No matter how many virgins are attached to its label, at the end of the day, it’s still a refined, concentrated fat—99.9% oil, stripped of all the fiber and phytonutrients found in whole olives.

Worse still, it’s unsuited to Indian cooking.
We typically cook at high temperatures—think of our tadkas and deep frying—and olive oil breaks down and oxidizes quickly at those temperatures, especially extra virgin olive oil. The fumes and byproducts can be harmful.

A better alternative for high-heat Indian cooking is mustard oil, which has a high smoke point and has traditionally been used in Indian kitchens. But again, only use it if you must. Eating whole mustard seeds in your food is far healthier than consuming mustard oil.

Better yet, explore oil-free cooking methods: steaming, dry roasting, sautéing in water or vegetable broth, and baking. You’ll retain the flavors, improve your health, and save money.

In Summary:

When someone says “this food is healthy,” ask: Healthy compared to what?

Don’t fall for the trap of relative health claims.
	•	Jaggery is healthier than sugar—but it’s not healthy.
	•	Red wine is better than whisky—but it’s not good for you.
	•	Olive oil is less harmful than butter—but it’s still a processed, empty-calorie fat.

The only foods that truly promote health are whole, unrefined, plant-based foods—fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices.

And here’s the real rule of thumb:
If it grew on a plant, eat it.
If it was made in a plant, think twice.

[10/29/25, 6:56:06 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Doctors’ Advice on Medications •

If you are taking medication for a lifestyle disease, ask yourself: Why am I expected to take this for the rest of my life? Doctors often prescribe medications quickly because that’s what they are taught in medical school. Once you’re on lifelong medication, you become a lifelong patient—needing refills, follow-ups, and continued medical supervision.

In India, many patients expect a prescription; if they leave a doctor’s clinic without one, they feel shortchanged. Deprescribing is rare. It isn’t in the interest of doctors or pharmaceutical companies to stop medications.

Here are some observations:

1. Symptom-Focused Approach
Most doctors focus on reducing symptoms to “normal” ranges. The underlying causes often remain unaddressed or are oversimplified—usually blamed on overeating or lack of exercise.

2. Prescription-Driven Practice
Doctors prescribe medication because that’s what is expected of them professionally and legally. It’s part of the standard treatment protocols they are trained to follow.

3. Lack of Nutrition Education
Doctors rarely discuss diet or lifestyle because they receive little to no training in nutrition. With limited time per patient, medication is often the quickest solution.

4. Medical Standards of Care
Doctors must follow standard care protocols to protect their licenses. In countries like the U.S., deviations can lead to malpractice lawsuits. Different specializations have different governing bodies. For example, both endocrinologists and general practitioners treat diabetes, but they may follow conflicting standards.

5. Governing Body Interests
Medical organizations often act in the interest of their members. Guidelines that lower diagnostic thresholds—meaning more patients and more prescriptions—are adopted quickly. But when new evidence supports relaxing those thresholds, changes are slow.

A case in point:
In 1996, the fasting glucose cutoff for diagnosing diabetes was lowered from 140 to 126 mg/dL—quickly embraced by medical bodies. But in 2018, when guidelines were relaxed to an HbA1C of up to 8.0, it wasn’t widely adopted. The American Diabetes Association (ADA) recommends 7.0, while the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) recommends 6.5—leading to confusion.

This hesitation to reverse course is human nature. Once income increases, few willingly go back. A Hindi couplet from 400 years ago says:

बढ़त-बढ़त सम्पति-सलिलु, मन-सरोजु बढ़ि जाइ।
घटत-घटत फिरि न घटै, बरु समूल कुम्हिलाइ॥

“As one’s wealth grows, so does the lotus of desire. But when the water (wealth) recedes, the lotus cannot shrink back—it withers entirely.”

6. The Chronic Condition Mindset
Even when symptoms improve, doctors often discourage stopping medications. They believe the underlying disease is chronic and incurable, and improvements are solely due to ongoing medication.

Taking Charge of Your Health

As we explore various diseases in future blog posts, you will face these realities. Many people in my health group ask how to reduce or stop medications. It is inappropriate for me to provide individual medical advice. That’s a decision between you and your doctor.

However, I aim to empower you with knowledge so you can have a more informed conversation with your physician. Adopting a plant-based whole food (PBWF) diet, intermittent fasting, and a physically active lifestyle can lead to measurable improvements—and possibly reduced reliance on medication.

When & How to Reduce Medication

Once you consistently follow a PBWF diet, walk daily, and eat early dinners, you’ll likely notice better sleep and increased energy. Track your blood pressure, blood sugar, and other markers at home. If they fall below clinical thresholds, discuss reducing your medications with your doctor.

Be aware: your doctor may not be familiar with the most recent guidelines (e.g., JNC-8 for blood pressure, ACP 2018 for diabetes). You may need to bring them up and explain your lifestyle changes. If your doctor is not open to adjusting medications, consider a second opinion.

Important: I am not a doctor and do not offer medical advice. Any change in medication must be done with your physician’s guidance.

A Case Example: Dr. McDougall’s Approach
Dr. John McDougall, in his 10-day live-in program in Santa Rosa, California, stopped all medications on day one—for all participants. His reasoning: when patients switched to a PBWF diet, their markers improved rapidly, and continuing medication could cause harmful drops, especially in blood sugar for diabetic patients.

This illustrates why diabetic patients must reduce insulin and medications in coordination with their doctors when switching to a healthier lifestyle.

Guiding Principles
- Never stop medications without first changing your diet and lifestyle.
- Always prioritize sustainable lifestyle improvements over quick fixes.
- Regularly monitor your progress and keep your doctor informed.
- Respect that some doctors may not believe in stopping lifelong medications—seek a second opinion if needed.
- Understand that reducing medications safely depends on the severity of your condition and your consistency in following the new lifestyle.

Some people reduce medications by half every month, while others do so more gradually. If new guidelines suggest you were never a candidate for medication in the first place, your doctor may agree to stop it immediately.

For instance, current recommendations are:
- Blood Pressure: 140/90 for people under 60; 150/90 for those over 60
- Diabetes: HbA1C up to 8.0 is now considered acceptable in many cases

Final Note
Recent research shows that aggressively managing numbers (like glucose or BP) with medication can sometimes do more harm than good. This topic is discussed in my blog post, “Better Safe Than Sorry”, where I debunk common medical myths.

The key takeaway: Start with food, not pharmaceuticals. As your health improves, let the numbers guide the conversation—with your doctor. You deserve to know all your options.

[10/30/25, 7:13:18 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •VITAMIN D SUPPLEMENTATION: A Deeper Look

I repeatedly try to emphasize a crucial point: our understanding of nutrition is still in its infancy. We’ve only scratched the surface. When it comes to how food and nutrients interact with the body, there is far more we don’t know than we do. That’s why humility is essential when discussing nutrition—especially with something as debated as vitamin D.

Dr. Robert Lustig of the University of California, San Francisco, shares a story from his first day at Cornell Medical School. During a welcome address, the Dean told incoming students: “Half of what we’re going to teach you over the next four years is wrong. The problem is—we don’t know which half.”

The ongoing debate over vitamin D in the medical community is a perfect example of this uncertainty, as you’ll see in this blog.

The Vitamin D Debate

One of the most common and hotly debated questions I’m asked is:
Should we take vitamin D supplements?

Many people today are diagnosed as “deficient” in vitamin D. For years, the recommended healthy range has been 30–50 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml). However, many experts—including my teacher, Dr. John McDougall—had questioned this range, suggesting that 20–40 ng/ml may be more than sufficient.

But this raises a deeper question that often goes unaddressed:
Are people who are healthy because they have high vitamin D levels?
Or do they have high vitamin D levels because they’re healthy and spend more time outdoors?

In other words: is vitamin D causally linked to good health, or is it merely associated with it?

What COVID-19 Taught Us

During the COVID-19 pandemic, several studies found that people who experienced severe symptoms often had low vitamin D levels, while those with higher levels tended to do better. This seemed to support the idea that vitamin D was protective—but again, the same question arose:
Were their outcomes better because of vitamin D?
Or were those people already healthier due to more sun exposure and better lifestyle habits, with high vitamin D levels being just one reflection of that?

The Emerging Science: Beyond Vitamin D

Recent research offers fascinating insights into the benefits of sunlight—many of which go well beyond vitamin D production.
	1.	Infrared Light and Melatonin Production
Sunlight contains a full spectrum of wavelengths from ultraviolet (UV) to infrared (IR). When our skin is exposed to IR light, it stimulates melatonin production within every cell of the body—not just in the brain.
This melatonin acts as a powerful antioxidant, helping to reduce oxidative stress and protect mitochondrial function.
	2.	Ultraviolet Light and Vitamin D
Vitamin D is only synthesized when the skin is exposed to ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, which are shorter in wavelength. These rays are strongest around midday. However, during early mornings and late evenings, UVB rays are weaker due to the angle of the sun, while IR rays remain relatively strong.
	3.	Sunlight and Blood Sugar Control
One study on patients with diabetes showed that post-meal blood sugar spikes were significantly lower when individuals were exposed to sunlight. This again points to broader benefits of sun exposure unrelated to vitamin D.
	4.	Swedish Study on Sun Exposure and Mortality
In a remarkable 20-year study of 30,000 Swedish women, participants were grouped based on sun exposure: minimal, moderate, and high.
The findings were striking:
- Women with the highest sun exposure had the lowest mortality rates from cancer, cardiovascular, and non-cardiovascular diseases.
- Smokers in the high-sun group had the same mortality as non-smokers in the low-sun group.
In other words, lack of sun exposure was as dangerous as smoking.
	5.	U.S. COVID Study and Geography
Data also showed that people living in southern U.S. states—where sun exposure is higher year-round—had lower COVID-19 mortality rates than those in northern states.

Rethinking “Deficiency”

These recent research highlight an important nuance:
Time of day matters.

If someone gets regular morning or evening sun, they may benefit greatly from infrared exposure, which supports cellular health—but their vitamin D levels may still be low, simply because UVB rays are weak at those times.

This means a person could have low vitamin D levels on paper yet still be in excellent health. On the flip side, someone supplementing to maintain high vitamin D levels might assume they are healthy, when in fact they are missing out on the broader benefits of real sunlight.

To Conclude:

Sunlight is more important than vitamin D. Even 15–20 minutes of sun exposure at any time of day supports mitochondrial function and reduces the risk of major metabolic diseases—including diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and even cancer.

For optimal vitamin D production, mid-morning (about 2 hours after sunrise) to mid-afternoon (2 hours before sunset) is the best time to get direct sun.

But don’t fall into the trap of thinking that a normal vitamin D level—achieved through supplements—means you’re fine. It’s not just about the number on the lab report. It’s about the quality of your sun exposure and its far-reaching effects on your overall health.

[10/30/25, 7:13:19 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Food Science, Nutrition, and Metabolic Health•

In the 1920s, research on celiac disease experienced by sailors on long voyages led to the discovery of vitamin C. At the time, the conclusion was not that the real issue was a lack of fresh fruits and vegetables, but rather a deficiency of a specific nutrient. This marked the beginning of what we now consider nutrition science.

Similarly, the development of antibiotics also in 1928 gave rise to modern health science, which often embraces the idea of “a pill for every ill.” These approaches served us well for decades. However, a growing number of doctors and nutritionists are beginning to recognize that we may have made some critical errors in our understanding.

Dr. Colin Campbell, the number one nutritionist in the world, for example, has spoken out against the reductionist view of nutrition—where the focus is placed on individual nutrients rather than the complex interactions among them in whole plant foods. Just because a nutrient is isolated and supplemented doesn’t mean the body will absorb and utilize it effectively.

The emerging field of epigenetics has further challenged traditional views. It has shown us that bacteria are not necessarily our enemies—in fact, they are essential partners, producing many of the chemicals our bodies need. Every plant food has its own unique bacterial profile, which helps colonize our gut. Our immunity and overall health are deeply tied to the well-being of this internal ecosystem. Antibiotics, while sometimes necessary, can harm this microbial balance and have long-term consequences.

We seem to have come full circle, realizing that some of what we once thought was harmful may not be, and vice versa. Paradigms are shifting, and many of the lessons from the past century must be reconsidered.

New Insights
New insights continue to reshape our understanding. For example, the Nobel Prizes awarded in 2016, 2017, and 2018 highlighted groundbreaking discoveries in areas such as autophagy and circadian biology. These findings show that the absence of food—and the timing of food intake—can be just as important as the food itself. This has profound implications for how we approach diet and lifestyle choices today.

Food Science, Nutrition & Metabolic Health
Food science, nutrition, and metabolic health are three distinct fields that are often misunderstood or used interchangeably. Here’s what each actually means:
* Food Science deals with what happens to food from the time it’s grown until it reaches your mouth—processing, storage, preservation, and preparation.
* Nutrition concerns what happens to food after it enters your mouth—how it’s digested, absorbed, and transported to your cells.
* Metabolic Health focuses on what happens to food inside your cells—how it’s used to produce energy and support cellular function.

The Real Problem: Metabolic Dysfunction

Many chronic diseases—such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, dyslipidemia, fatty liver, cancer, dementia, and PCOS—stem from metabolic dysfunction at the cellular level. These conditions account for nearly 75% of the entire U.S. healthcare budget. Despite this, our current medical approach largely focuses on symptom management rather than root-cause resolution. Here are some examples. 

	1.	Heart Disease:
We use statins to lower LDL cholesterol, but LDL is not the root problem—it’s a symptom or marker of an underlying issue. That’s why using statins for primary prevention doesn’t significantly extend lifespan: we’re not fixing the real problem.
	2.	Hypertension:
We treat high blood pressure with medications, but we’re not addressing endothelial dysfunction—the underlying issue that leads to kidney failure, heart failure, and more. Lowering blood pressure helps, but it’s a temporary patch, not a cure.
	3.	High Blood Glucose:
We prescribe drugs to reduce blood sugar, but we’re not correcting insulin resistance or pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction, which are the actual causes. Again, lowering blood glucose isn’t bad, but it doesn’t fix the metabolic defects that led to it in the first place. We’re managing symptoms while ignoring the disease mechanism.

For the past seven decades, this symptom-based approach hasn’t solved the problem. It’s time to shift our mindset and focus on the root cause—mitochondrial dysfunction.

The Role of Mitochondria
Mitochondria are the powerhouses of the cell, generating ATP—the chemical energy our bodies depend on. Without ATP, cells cannot function. When mitochondria fail, cells must shift to a less efficient energy system: fermentation instead of oxidation.

For example, cancer cells can survive without oxygen by relying heavily on glucose. Why? Because their mitochondria are damaged or entirely nonfunctional. This mitochondrial dysfunction is at the core of many metabolic diseases.

Rethinking Our Belief Systems
Much like religion, nutrition has long been treated as a matter of dogma. People change their religion usually because their current beliefs no longer serve them. The same is happening in nutrition.

People are questioning outdated ideas. For decades, we’ve used a reductionist approach to food, focusing on isolated nutrients and calorie counting. But this has failed to improve public health. Experts like Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. Robert Lustig have worked to challenge and dismantle these flawed beliefs. Dr. Campbell teaches that we should think of food as a whole, not just as a sum of its nutrient parts. Every food contains a unique “symphony” of nutrients that work together in ways we’re only beginning to understand.

[10/30/25, 7:13:19 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Healthy vs Unhealthy •

A common question that keeps coming up is: “Is this food healthy?”
We also frequently encounter media articles comparing one food with another, making claims such as:
	1.	Jaggery is healthy
	2.	Red Wine is healthy
	3.	Olive Oil is healthy

These comparisons often confuse people because they blur the crucial difference between something being healthy and something being healthier.

Let’s get this straight:
Just because one food is less harmful than another doesn’t automatically make it healthy. Being “healthier” is a relative concept—it only means it’s the lesser evil when compared to something worse. That doesn’t qualify it as beneficial or safe for regular consumption. Let’s look at the three examples mentioned above:

1. Jaggery vs Refined Sugar

Jaggery is often marketed as a traditional, “natural” sweetener with supposed health benefits. Articles tout it as rich in minerals like iron and magnesium. But here’s the catch—they’re always comparing it to refined white sugar.

Sure, if your only two options are jaggery and refined sugar, jaggery is the slightly better choice. But that does not mean it is healthy. It’s still a concentrated form of sugar and will still spike your blood glucose, burden your liver, and contribute to insulin resistance.

If you’ve already managed to eliminate added sugars from your diet and are getting all the sugar you need from fruits and vegetables, please don’t go back and “reward” yourself by adding jaggery. That would be a step backward, not forward.

Want something truly better? Eat sugarcane. It has fiber, water, and micronutrients. Much less damaging than jaggery—which is, in essence, boiled-down, dehydrated sugarcane juice minus all the good stuff.

2. Red Wine vs Other Alcohols

Red wine often gets glowing coverage in lifestyle magazines and health columns. The reason? It contains resveratrol, a plant compound with antioxidant properties that has shown some promise in lab studies.

But let’s be clear: that doesn’t make red wine a health food. It is still alcohol, a known toxin that damages the liver, increases cancer risk, and impairs brain function over time.

So why the good press? It’s all about context. The studies compare red wine to other alcoholic beverages. So, in that narrow context, red wine emerges as the least harmful. If you are absolutely forced to choose between red wine, white wine, and scotch (say, you’re kidnapped and only these three are on offer—no water, no tea, no coconut water), go with red wine. At least it brings along a few antioxidants for the ride.

But if you don’t already drink alcohol, please don’t start—not for the resveratrol, not for “heart health,” not for social status. Even the World Health Organization is crystal clear on this: no level of alcohol consumption is completely safe.

Want resveratrol? Eat a handful of red grapes. Or better still, eat a bowl of berries, which are even richer in health-protective phytonutrients—without the alcohol, of course.

3. Olive Oil vs Other Oils

Many health-conscious Indians have now adopted extra virgin olive oil, believing it’s a “healthy fat.” The marketing works beautifully: words like “cold-pressed,” “extra virgin,” and even “Mediterranean diet” all paint olive oil as a miracle elixir.

But here’s the inconvenient truth: Olive oil is not healthy.
It’s just less harmful than things like butter, lard, or hydrogenated oils. No matter how many virgins are attached to its label, at the end of the day, it’s still a refined, concentrated fat—99.9% oil, stripped of all the fiber and phytonutrients found in whole olives.

Worse still, it’s unsuited to Indian cooking.
We typically cook at high temperatures—think of our tadkas and deep frying—and olive oil breaks down and oxidizes quickly at those temperatures, especially extra virgin olive oil. The fumes and byproducts can be harmful.

A better alternative for high-heat Indian cooking is mustard oil, which has a high smoke point and has traditionally been used in Indian kitchens. But again, only use it if you must. Eating whole mustard seeds in your food is far healthier than consuming mustard oil.

Better yet, explore oil-free cooking methods: steaming, dry roasting, sautéing in water or vegetable broth, and baking. You’ll retain the flavors, improve your health, and save money.

In Summary:

When someone says “this food is healthy,” ask: Healthy compared to what?

Don’t fall for the trap of relative health claims.
	•	Jaggery is healthier than sugar—but it’s not healthy.
	•	Red wine is better than whisky—but it’s not good for you.
	•	Olive oil is less harmful than butter—but it’s still a processed, empty-calorie fat.

The only foods that truly promote health are whole, unrefined, plant-based foods—fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains, nuts, seeds, herbs, and spices.

And here’s the real rule of thumb:
If it grew on a plant, eat it.
If it was made in a plant, think twice.

[10/30/25, 7:13:20 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •• BREAKFAST OR NOT? •• 

Technically speaking, breakfast is simply the first meal of the day, no matter when you eat it. Whether it’s 7 a.m., noon, or 3 p.m.—whenever you break your overnight fast, that is your “break-fast.”

However, in common usage, breakfast is almost always associated with the early morning—a meal eaten shortly after waking up. This association is relatively modern in the sweep of human history.

A Brief History of “Breakfast”

The word breakfast appeared in written English during the 15th century, referring literally to the act of “breaking the fast” from the night before. In Old English, people used the word morgenmete, which simply meant “morning meal.”

Throughout much of human history, meals were shaped by necessity, not routine. People often ate one or two meals a day depending on their lifestyle, work, or availability of food. Regular morning meals were not always standard practice.

In fact, in many traditional cultures, people began their day with work or activity and did not eat immediately upon waking. Even today, in many parts of rural India or Africa, breakfast as we know it is minimal or delayed.

The Birth of the Modern “Breakfast”

The cultural and commercial rise of the modern breakfast owes much to one man: Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, a physician, health reformer, and Seventh-day Adventist who ran the Battle Creek Sanitarium in Michigan in the late 1800s.

Kellogg was obsessed with digestive health and bowel regularity. He was a strong proponent of bland, fiber-rich, meatless diets and believed that spicy or rich foods (as well as masturbation) led to poor health. He promoted enemas, hydrotherapy, and vegetarianism as tools for maintaining internal purity.

In his quest to develop a healthy, palatable food for his patients, he invented Corn Flakes, along with his brother, Will Keith Kellogg. Originally, the flakes were entirely plain and unsweetened—intended as a bland, wholesome food to calm the passions and nourish the gut.

Will Kellogg, however, saw commercial potential in this invention. He eventually added sugar to the flakes and began mass marketing them as a ready-to-eat breakfast cereal. The Kellogg Company was born, and with it began the commercialization of breakfast on a massive scale.

To help promote cereal, the idea that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” was popularized. The phrase first appeared in Good Health magazine in 1917, written by Lenna F. Cooper, a nurse and dietitian trained under Dr. Kellogg. This slogan became a marketing hook—one that stuck, thanks to decades of advertising.

The Processed Food Industry Takes Over

Today, breakfast cereals are a multi-billion dollar industry. Aisles in grocery stores are lined with boxes claiming health benefits, energy boosts, or vitamin enrichment. Many of these cereals are loaded with sugar, preservatives, artificial flavors, and refined grains—a far cry from Kellogg’s original idea of health.

Despite these nutritional drawbacks, the belief that breakfast is essential—especially cereal-based breakfast—remains deeply embedded in modern culture. But science is beginning to challenge this long-standing assumption.

Rethinking Breakfast in Light of Modern Science

Recent studies suggest that breakfast is not necessarily the most important meal of the day—especially not for everyone.

In fact, for individuals suffering from chronic metabolic conditions—such as:
	•	Type 2 diabetes
	•	Hypertension
	•	Obesity
	•	Fatty liver
	•	Metabolic syndrome

—skipping or delaying breakfast may actually be beneficial.

Why? Because the human body is not designed to be in a constant fed state. When we eat frequently and start early, we don’t allow the body time to repair, recycle, or switch metabolic gears.

Intermittent Fasting: The Metabolic Shift

The concept of intermittent fasting (IF) has gained scientific traction in recent years. One of the most common and effective patterns is the 16:8 method, where you fast for 16 hours and eat within an 8-hour window.

This method works with the body’s natural rhythm. Here’s how:
	•	The liver stores about 500 calories worth of glucose (glycogen), which is used up in roughly 10–12 hours after your last meal.
	•	Once glycogen is depleted, the body switches to burning fat for energy—entering a state called ketosis.
	•	This fat-burning phase reduces visceral fat, liver fat, and intramyocellular lipids (fat stored in muscle).
	•	It also triggers autophagy, a cellular clean-up process that helps prevent disease and promotes longevity. This process earned the 2016 Nobel Prize in Medicine.

So, by delaying or skipping breakfast, we allow the body to transition from glucose burning to fat burning, giving our organs a much-needed metabolic break.

But What If You Do Eat Breakfast?

If your lifestyle or health condition doesn’t require fasting—or if you’re still easing into the practice—you can still make breakfast a nutritious and healing meal.

Here’s an ideal approach to break-fast when you’re ready to eat:
	1.	Start with a Green Juice or Smoothie
Made from spinach, kale, green apples, amla, coriander, celery, cucumber, lemon, ginger etc. This provides chlorophyll, minerals, and enzymes.
	2.	Follow with a Large Serving of Fruits
Fruits are rich in water, fiber, and natural sugars. They hydrate, cleanse the system, and provide quick energy without burdening digestion.
	3.	Finish with a Whole Grain or Fermented Food
	•	Oatmeal is excellent—rich in soluble fiber, it helps lower LDL cholesterol and keeps you full longer.
	•	Idly with chutney (not sambhar) is another great option. Idly is fermented and steamed; chutney can be made oil-free. Avoid sambhar if it contains oil, as that adds unnecessary fat and can promote inflammation.

Final Thoughts

The blanket statement that “breakfast is the most important meal of the day” needs to be revisited in light of modern evidence. While breakfast might still be important for children, athletes, or those with special nutritional needs, it is not a universal rule—and certainly not a sacred one.

If you’re trying to reverse chronic illness, improve your metabolism, or lose excess fat, skipping or delaying breakfast and narrowing your eating window may be more effective than focusing on what you eat in the morning.

Let’s unlearn the myths handed down by food marketing, and instead make decisions based on biology, history, and personal health goals. Whether you eat breakfast or not—eat consciously, not conventionally.

[10/30/25, 7:13:21 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: •Omega-3:ALA, DHA, EPA•

The human body is remarkably efficient at converting excess calories into fat. This mechanism evolved as a survival strategy—storing energy during times of abundance to sustain us during times of scarcity. Fat is found in all plant-based foods, and consuming just 10–15% of our daily calories from fat is more than sufficient for health.

There are three main types of fats:
- Saturated Fats: Primarily found in animal products. Among plant sources, coconut and palm kernel oil are notable examples.
- Monounsaturated Fats: Found in nuts, avocados, olives, and mustard seeds.
- Polyunsaturated Fats: This group includes essential fats like omega-3 (found in dark leafy greens, walnuts, flaxseeds, chia seeds) and omega-6 (found in corn, sunflower, safflower, and cottonseed oils).

Of all these fats, only two fatty acids are considered essential—meaning the body cannot produce them on its own and they must be obtained through food. These are omega-3 and omega-6. Other fats are not considered essential.

Omega-3 fats exist in three forms:
- ALA (alpha-linolenic acid) – Found in plant foods like flaxseeds, chia seeds, and walnuts.
- DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and
- EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) – Found primarily in animal foods, especially fish.

The human body can convert ALA (from plant sources) into DHA and EPA, although this conversion rate is sometimes questioned. Based on certain studies, some experts suggest that the conversion may be inadequate, and therefore DHA/EPA supplements should be taken.

However, I do not agree with this view—for the following reasons:
- Evolutionary Logic: My core philosophy is grounded in the belief that the human body, shaped by millions of years of evolution, knows how to process natural, whole foods. If we simply eat whole, plant-based foods as intended by nature, the body can take care of itself. Supplements are often unnecessary—and potentially harmful. The only exception is Vitamin B12, which is no longer naturally available due to water chlorination and modern hygiene practices. Suggesting that the body cannot convert enough ALA into DHA and EPA contradicts this evolutionary logic.
- Differing Expert Opinions: Even among leading voices in the plant-based, whole-food (PBWF) community, there are differences in opinion. In such cases, I choose to align with those whose views resonate with my experience and understanding. I personally discussed this issue with Dr. T. Colin Campbell and Dr. John McDougall, both of whom advise against DHA/EPA supplementation. Dr. Campbell offered the following statement:

“If I must answer the DHA question, I would only say that we can get plenty of that type of chemical from the consumption of the omega-3 fatty acids that are found in certain plants—certain nuts, flaxseed, etc. Indeed, it also is related to a dietary balance of omega-3 to omega-6 fatty acids, and this balance can be readily met with a good-quality diet of wholesome vegetables, fruits, grains, and nuts.”

For further insight, I highly recommend reading the following article.

[10/30/25, 7:13:21 PM] ~ Meenakshi Nigam: Concluding Remarks

This course has explored the five pillars of health and the forces that shape our understanding of it. The twelve-point guidelines shared here can help anyone live a healthy, disease-free life.

Even health-conscious people can make poor choices when guided by misinformation. Modern medicine often suppresses symptoms rather than addressing root causes. Yet true healing begins with correcting diet and lifestyle. Hippocrates taught that food and daily habits form the foundation of health—a principle lost when medicine shifted toward drugs after the early 1900s.

Industrialization of food for profit replaced nourishment with convenience. As fiber disappeared and physical activity declined, lifestyle diseases emerged. These cannot be cured by medication; drugs may normalize numbers but leave the cause untouched. The health advice we receive is often influenced by industries that benefit from dependency on their products.

Common myths persist:
   •   High protein intake is essential.
   •   Dairy is required for strong bones.
   •   “Everything in moderation” is healthy.
   •   A calorie is a calorie, regardless of source.
   •   Chronic diseases are incurable.

Science tells a different story. Most chronic illnesses result from poor diet and lifestyle—and when these are corrected, the body begins to heal. Symptoms are not enemies but messages from within, urging us to change. Suppressing them with medication is like silencing the messenger.

The body continually adjusts to unhealthy habits, and these compensations are often mistaken for disease. Medications that aim to “fix” biomarkers may disturb natural balance and give false comfort. Real recovery begins when we align with nature and allow the body to restore itself.

Reducing Medications

After adopting a whole-food, plant-based diet, regular walking, and early dinners, most people see improved energy, sleep, and blood markers. Track your progress at home and, when numbers improve, consult your physician about gradually tapering medication. Always change your diet before reducing drugs, and never stop medication without guidance.

Updated guidelines recommend more moderate targets:
   •   Blood pressure below 140/90 for those under 60, and 150/90 for those over 60.
   •   HbA1C up to 8.0 for diabetics.

If your doctor is unaware of these updates or hesitant to adjust prescriptions, consider a second opinion. Medication for lifestyle diseases should never be lifelong if underlying causes are removed.

Reclaiming Our Health

During the last century, materialism and profit-driven science distorted healthcare and nutrition. Medical education sidelined prevention and neglected nutrition training. Food science, focused on taste and shelf life, stripped fiber and nutrients from our meals. The result has been damaged microbiomes and epidemics of metabolic and inflammatory disease.

Reductionist science treated nutrients in isolation instead of understanding food as a whole. Medicine, built around symptom suppression, joined hands with industries that profit when people stay sick. Drugs that mask symptoms often work against the body’s natural healing, accelerating decline.

To reclaim our health, we must move from managing disease to eliminating its causes. That means choosing whole, unprocessed plant foods, restoring fiber, staying active, sleeping early, and respecting the body’s innate intelligence. This course was created to bring these truths to light and offer a path to sustainable well-being.

Concluding Reflections

Science is an ever-evolving quest filled with what I call Not Yet Knowns (NYKnowns). Our grandchildren will know far more than we do—perhaps even laugh at the idea that medicine was once used to treat illness.

Through my own recovery and guiding thousands of others, I’ve learned that the solutions are few and simple. The same diet and lifestyle that prevent one chronic disease prevent them all. The American Gut Project confirmed that eating a wide variety of plant foods builds a diverse microbiome and stronger immunity. The same likely applies to our lungs and skin—diversity in diet and environment builds resilience.

Our bodies are complex, but the principles of health are simple. Even sunlight—once valued only for vitamin D—is now known to generate melatonin within cells and promote deeper healing. What once seemed a “cause” may simply be a marker of good health.

Though this is the final post of this course, I hope it marks a new beginning for you. The next part covered in the Advanced Course will focus on specific lifestyle diseases and their connection to diet and daily habits. My wish is that you carry this knowledge forward—to apply it, to share it, and to help create a world where health is our natural state.

I end with lines I first spoke as a nine-year-old in a school play—words that have guided me for life:

“Of all the doctors in this town,
No one has such high renown,
As Doctors Sunshine, Rest, Good Food,
And Dr. Fresh Air too is good.”

Let these be your lifelong physicians.
