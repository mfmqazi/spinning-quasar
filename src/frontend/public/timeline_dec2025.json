        "content": "••••   WELCOME   ••••\nWelcome all to this health group! The purpose of this group is to empower you to take control of your health and, ideally, reduce or eliminate the need for medications used to manage lifestyle-related diseases. This will be achieved through education on a Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, active living, Intermittent Fasting (IF), and a therapeutic fasting-based lifestyle.\nHousekeeping Rules\n1.Please avoid posting greeting messages.\n2.Do not share forwarded content unless accompanied by your own detailed commentary.\n3.Discussions must remain focused on chronic health issues.\n4.Limit two-way conversations to one round only.\n5. No solicitations are allowed.\nMy Introduction:\nMany members may not know me, so let me introduce myself.\nMy name is Lalit M. Kapoor, and I live in the San Francisco Bay Area—specifically in Berkeley. I graduated from IIT Kanpur in 1971 and moved to UCLA in 1973 to complete my MBA. I’ve been living in the U.S. ever since.\nAfter successfully selling the companies I started, I retired from business in 2005. Since then, I have pursued health and anti-aging research as a personal passion.\nTwelve years ago, I watched the documentary Forks Over Knives, which deeply resonated with me. I was inspired to adopt the PBWF lifestyle recommended by several doctors featured in the film. Within 18 months, I lost 50 pounds and discontinued five prescription medications. Conditions I overcame include diabetes, hypertension, osteoarthritis, hypothyroidism, gout, sleep apnea, and seasonal allergies. I felt more energetic than I had in decades—even completing my first half-marathon.\nIn 2017, I created a WhatsApp group for my 1971 IITK batchmates to share my experience. Many reported similar results and successfully reduced or eliminated their medications. As the group grew through referrals, I went on to create over 600 health groups and have coached more than 300,000 members.\nBased on that experience and continued learning and new research in the fields of nutrition and health, I’ve fine-tuned my recommendations. Many members now see improvement within just two weeks. Your progress will depend on your medical history and how consistently you follow the guidance. I made my changes at age 63; others have seen results even at 85. I’ll share their stories with you along the way.\nI will be assisted by Meenakshi Nigam in posting regular content and coaching you through this journey. We will also share short videos and lectures by leading doctors and professors from institutions like UCSF, USC, and Cleveland Clinic. Most videos are 5–10 minutes, with a few longer talks. I strongly encourage you to watch them, as my posts will be brief and may not cover every detail. As they say, a picture is worth a thousand words; a video is worth a thousand pictures.\nYou’ll have the opportunity to ask questions, but based on experience, many early questions are answered in subsequent posts. For that reason, Q&A sessions will begin after the first two weeks and occur once per week. During this time, member posting will be paused and reopened periodically for questions.\nDuring the first three weeks the focus will be on:\n• What to eat and what not to eat\n• When to eat and when not to eat\n• How to cook and eat mindfully\n• How to detoxify our body\n• Physical activity\n• Emotional Health\n• Spiritual Health\nDuring fourth week we will cover the political landscape of the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, and explore the influence of government and media.\nBeginning this month the course has been split into two modules. The second module which focusses on Chronic diseases will be offered separately beginning November.\nAs the course progresses, many members begin to see health improvements and share their stories. Most people who follow the guidance are able to discontinue some or most of their medications within months—especially those with hypertension, diabetes, and high cholesterol. While some conditions lack clear metrics, it is difficult to assess progress. Most members report feeling younger and more energetic.\nIt is highly recommended that members of the group share the posts with their spouses and watch the videos and documentaries together. The enrollment in WhatsApp groups has now stopped, please don’t send any requests for adding members. I start a new group every month.\nPast participants report spending 45–60 minutes daily during the first month, reading posts and watching videos. At the end of the one month program, you will be invited to join a geographically organized group of alumni for continued activities and support.\nWhile we waited for others to join, I recommended you watch Forks Over Knives. If you haven’t, please do so immediately. Also, watch its companion documentary Forks Over Knives: Extended Interviews. I will post a list of other documentaries soon.\nIf you are seriously ill or facing urgent medical decisions please consult your physician.\nPlease do not contact me directly. All questions should be asked in the group. With many groups and thousands of members running in parallel—including repeat participants—I ask that everyone follow the group’s pace and not skip ahead.\nThank you.\n————————————\nEND OF POST\n————————————",

        "content": "MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (1)\nBy definition, a myth is \"a widely held but false belief or idea.\" Where do they originate? Most myths are historical and long-held beliefs debunked with scientific knowledge gained through the advancement of science. However, in the modern world of social media, many myths can be intentionally implanted and quickly spread. Sometimes, even in the presence of evidence to the contrary, some myths continue to be propagated by vested interests.\nMyth: HUMANS EVOLVED AS HUNTERS\nHumans evolved as primates about 65 million years ago. Then, around 7 million years ago, we separated from Chimpanzees to Homonins with large brains and smaller teeth and bipedality. Homosapiens evolved about 2 million years ago. As humans evolved, most lived in temperate climates where there was an abundance of fresh produce throughout the year. The control over fire was only achieved about 400 thousand years ago. Prior to that, cooking was not an option. The idea of consuming raw meat in the presence of fresh fruits and vegetables seems unimaginable. Once we controlled fire it is safe to assume people might have moved into the temperate climate zones of Western civilizations, where winters are cold, and food does not grow for 6 months in a year, so societies evolved out of necessity to become meat eaters.\nAlso, until we evolved into the Bronze Age, there were not any tools available for hunting. Can you imagine hunting a buffalo or even a goat or deer with stones? Early humans were more likely to be gatherers and scavengers as opposed to hunters. In addition, human physiology with long intestines and a small jaw and teeth structure suggests that we evolved eating plant-based diets.\nFRESHWATER FISH\nThe only exception appears to be that of freshwater fish. As we moved from one place to another in search of food, we must have camped at places near freshwater. Fish were not so difficult to catch even in the Stone Age. Fish in its raw form is also not intolerable to our palate, as many  who eat Japanese Sushi would attest.\nHUMAN SETTLEMENTS\nAs humans started farming and domesticating animals, we must have started consuming animal milks, eggs, and meat. Eating a cooked masala omelet is much more palatable than raw eggs. The only food processing we were familiar with was peeling, chopping, grinding, mashing, shredding, etc. The concept of ultra-processed food really came into existence during the last century with industrialization. The necessity of feeding soldiers during the two World Wars led to the evolution of food processing and packaging industries. After the wars were over these food companies, with their excess capacities, started marketing more and more ultra-processed foods to the masses.\nMyth: TAKE A PILL WHEN ILL\nThe belief that when you are sick, you should take medicine, and the disease will go away started with the discovery of antibiotics 100 years ago. At the time, most dreaded diseases we faced were infectious diseases like Cholera, Typhoid, Smallpox, Polio, etc. The discovery of the antibiotic Penicillin in 1928 worked like a charm for such diseases. Over the years that followed, we as a society got accustomed to the idea of taking a pill when ill.\nPOST WORLD WAR 2 ERA\nIn the late 1940s, after the World Wars were over, Western governments ensured that food was inexpensive and plentiful. People had suffered food shortages for three decades due to depression and wars. Food got subsidized and even the poor started eating like kings. Chronic diseases, which earlier only affected the rich, became common. With the “take a pill when ill” psyche, it was natural for us to expect miracle drugs from our doctors, and they, along with the pharmaceutical industry, were quick to oblige. However, this time, the drugs did not cure the diseases so the doctors came up with the new explanation that lifestyle diseases are not curable, and doctors can only help manage them by keeping the symptoms in check through lifelong medications.\nDISENCHANTMENT AMONG DOCTORS\nSome doctors, who entered the medical field with a sincere desire to help humanity by curing diseases, slowly became disenchanted and started looking for answers elsewhere. They observed that, just like the wild animals of today and our ancestors of 10,000 years ago, all mammal’s organisms were self-healing, and symptoms were a natural compensatory response of the body. In a sense, symptoms are the messengers giving us clues that everything is not alright.\nBy taking medications to suppress the symptoms we are only interfering with the body’s self-healing mechanism.\nULTRA-PROCESSED FOOD\nAnother observation was that over the years, the profit motive of the food industry had changed the nature of food to refined and ultra-processed food-like products that bore little resemblance to food as we knew it. To increase shelf life fiber was removed and, to increase sales, taste was improved by adding sugar and oils. Experts with PhDs in psychology were deployed to make food taste addictive and non-satiating so people would eat more and buy more. These ultra-processed foods, in fact, were (a) increasing the toxicity of the body and (b) creating deficiencies of nutrients.\nIn addition, the use of inorganic fertilizers and single-crop farming depleted the soil of trace minerals. The produce, though sumptuous and beautiful looking, lacked nutrients, especially micronutrients. Damming rivers to generate hydropower did not help either. As minerals settle down upstream, in the lakes created by dams, it further depletes the soil of trace minerals. Processed and refined foods are not only deficient in nutrients but also full of preservatives. To reduce cost and increase profits, new inexpensive products like hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrups were developed. Deficiencies of nutrients reduce the body’s immunity making it more susceptible to diseases. The abundance of animal food, which was only available to kings and aristocrats earlier, was now available to the masses and caused havoc with their health.\nFinally, this new breed of doctors started to speak out, but their voices were muffled by the powerful lobby of the food, drug, and healthcare industries and the government, eager to please lobbyists with deep pockets. The Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement is the outgrowth of these pioneering voices.\nWHAT IS A PBWF DIET?\nA Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) diet, as the name implies, consists of following:\n- Only plant-based foods. No animal foods, no fish, eggs, or dairy. No butter or ghee.\n- No Refined or ultra-processed foods. No sugar or vegetable oils or refined flours. Take corn for example: Corn on the cob, Corn Soup, Corn Starch and Corn Flour would be considered whole foods. Corn Flakes, Corn Oil  and High Fructose Corn Syrup would be considered Ultra-processed foods.\nThis concept of food as holistic medicine dates back to the period of Hippocrates who said, \"let food be thy medicine.\" Hippocrates may have acquired this knowledge at Takshshila University of India: the world’s largest center of learning at the time. The latest research shows us that when you change your diet to plant based ehole food, your body begins to heal naturally and when your body heals, everything heals, including lifestyle diseases. This is the main theme of this blog as you will see in the weeks to come.\n—————————————\nEND OF BLOG\n—————————————",

        "content": "New Year Resolutions That Are Bound to Fail\nOn January 1, many of you are likely to have made resolutions to join the gym and start working out in new year. Food, along with its timing (as in circadian rhythm) and its absence (as in fasting), is the 800-pound gorilla in the room, and we often fail to recognize it. Physical exercise accounts for only 10-15% of our health yet we are completely enamored by it. What is the reason for such a disconnect?\nMyth: IT’S ALL YOUR FAULT (You Are Eating Too Much and Not Exercising Enough)\nThese words have been repeated by doctors and our elders often referred to as \"gluttony and sloth.\" Have you ever wondered why all mammals in the wild world don't have this problem and we humans didn't have it until a century ago? Wild animals eat as much as they’d like  as often as they’d like. A deer doesn't need a dietitian to dictate its diet. The reason we struggle might be simple: we are eating the wrong foods. The ultraprocessed foods we consume are designed for overconsumption by PhDs in psychology, circumventing our satiation mechanism.\nFLAWED NUTRITION SCIENCE\nNutrition science, as it has evolved over the past century, has gone in the wrong direction of reductionism. Looking at nutrition as individual nutrients and ensuring we get enough by supplementing them worsen the situation. This approach has led to a population where the number of sick people outweighs that of healthy people. Nutrients in food work like a symphony, and focusing on individual nutrients turns a harmonious body into chaos.\nULTRA PROCESSED FOOD\nThe profit motive of the food industry has resulted in an increasing amount of ultra-processed food that is both addictive and non-satiating, circumventing human satiation mechanisms. Additionally, calorie-dense and nutrient-poor food is prevalent. Soil depletion due to organized farming and damming of rivers has not helped either giving rise to a profitable supplements industry.\nOur body is impacted not only by known nutrients but also by nutrients we have not yet discovered. Consuming natural foods provides us with a package of known and not-yet-known nutrients. Supplements, on the other hand, only offer the nutrients we know about. We are not overeating by choice; the problem lies in the food we consume. Someone profits from it, and we find ourselves captive to it.\nAnother fact, studied by Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF, is that when insulin levels are high (common when overeating refined foods), our body wants to conserve energy and avoids physical activity. It's not our fault that we don't want to exercise; it's a result of ultra-processed foods. We are not the problem - the problem is ultra-processed food.\nI will be debunking many such myths that lead us to failure and worsen our health in my course You will learn what I call the Five Pillars of Health, a blueprint for wellbeing that, when followed, can rejuvenate your health and make you feel years younger.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "MYTHS ABOUT DIET & HEALTH (2)\nMYTH: EAT EVERYTHING IN MODERATION\nThese are “words of wisdom” often uttered by many respectable people including our elders and doctors. The problem with this advice is that when we consume everything in moderation, we also get diseases in moderation. This myth is so pervasive in our society that we have come to expect old age diseases as normal part of aging. What if we are wrong? In fact, we are wrong and it was proven 24 years ago when National Geographic commissioned a study with Dan Buettner, widely known as the Blue Zone Study.\nBlue Zone Study\nDan Buettner identified five communities worldwide with the longest living people: Okinawa (Japan), Sardinia (Italy), Icaria (Greece), Nicoya (Costa Rica) and Loma Linda (California, USA). These places showcased individuals living to 100-105 years without the prevalence of lifestyle diseases associated with old age.\nLessons learnt from these zones include a simple lifestyle, absence of modern processed foods, and daily activities involving over 10,000 steps.\nOUR ANCESTORS LIFE\nOur ancestors in India really did not live long lives. I remember in the 1950’s, if someone lived beyond 75-80 years, his death was celebrated as a life well lived. Today, at the age of 74, I shudder at that thought.\nHow Many Diseases?\nEstimates suggest around 10,000 diseases afflict humans, and the field of medical sciences continues to specialize with over 135 medical specialties. The lack of centralized monitoring for medications prescribed by specialists adds complexity to addressing negative side effects and adverse drug reactions.\nMYTH: DIFFERENT DIETS FOR DIFFERENT DISEASES\nMost people have a belief that there must be a different diet plan recommendation for different illnesses. The most common question asked in my health groups is “I suffer from X, Y and Z. What should I eat?”  Food should be healthy to prevent all diseases, if not, it would create an unresolvable dilemma as to what diseases should I treat and which ones suffer. This is likely one or the biggest myth of all and is continuously propagated by many dietitians, doctors, naturopaths and health spas. Just imagine you are suffering from diseases X, Y and Z and you are prescribed the following diet:\n-For disease X: eat A, D, G, K & N and avoid  B, E, H, J & P\n-For disease Y: eat B, F, L, P & R and avoid  C, G, M, S & Q\n-For disease Z: eat C, F, H, Q & S and avoid  A, G, K, P & T\nHow would you figure out what to eat and what to avoid? The premise that there is a special diet for every disease is fundamentally flawed. When you eat a Plant Based Whole Food diet, with a diverse variety of foods in each food group, your body receives all the nutrients it needs and it heals. And when body heals everything heals.\nSelf Selection\nWhen we look around in wilderness we find that animals living there eat whatever they want whenever they want and as much as they want. Why are humans are incapable of doing that? Why do we have to consult a dietitian to find out what to eat, what not to eat, how much to eat and when to eat it? During the 1930s many studies were done on this subject of self selection and it was found that, over an extended period of time, animals were able to self select their food choices in a way that their bodies remained healthy without creating any deficiency or excesses. One such study done in Canada in the 1930s on young children found that over a period of 6 months when children were left to themselves to select their food, from a buffet of varied choices, they did fine and there were no deficiencies or excesses. It was concluded that among young children the process of self selection works fine.\nSo the question arises as to why we lose this innate ability to self select our own food. The answer lies in the fact that we human are social animals and as we grow up our decisions are based on more than physiology. We start consuming foods not necessarily because we find them tasty and rewarding but also because they fulfill our psychological needs: to show off, feel grown up or to belong to a certain clique. Many addictions like tea, coffee, alcohol and tobacco start that way. Nobody likes these at first and many find their taste and feel unpleasant.\nDesigner Foods\nSome foods are designed in ways to create a dopamine response that we find rewarding like refined fat and sugar. Even these foods, if not tinkered with by specialists, are likely to satiate us quickly and not lead to much overconsumption. However, when foods are designed by expert psychologists who know how to circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism we fall prey to them, wanting to eat more and more. The best example to make this point is potato chips. When you make them at home you can’t eat more than a dozen or so without feeling satiated. When you eat Pringles chips you can keep eating one after another until the box is empty. In fact, the company took pride in that and their advertising tag line was “Once you pop, you can't stop.” It is important to take conscious approach to our dietary choices.\nDiet Alone is Not the Solution\nSimilarly looking for all solutions in diet alone is also a flawed approach and needs correction. Recent research and Nobel prizes awarded in 2016, 2017 and 2018 have shown that when to eat (as in Circadian Rhythm) and when not to eat (as in fasting) are often equally important. In addition, the new science of microbes colonizing our colon called Epigenetics is creating a paradigm shift in our understanding of nutrition and diseases. Its impact is still not well understood but we are getting many clues.\nMany people do not follow lifestyle recommendations like intermittent fasting or Ekadashi fasting or Navratri fasting which are essential for detoxifying the body. Also many people eat late dinners (after it is dark outside) and go to bed shortly thereafter. These lifestyle choices impact our health in ways we are only beginning to understand.\nIn the coming weeks we will delve into lifestyle choices, like fasting, and their impact on health. Stay tuned.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Myth: HUMANS ARE VERY SIMILAR\nIt's been commonly assumed in medical research that all humans are similar, and therefore, findings from a small group can be generalized across the population, aside from racial and socioeconomic variations. Humans are indeed genetically similar, which underpins the belief that clinical studies on one group are applicable to others if they share racial and socioeconomic backgrounds. Some of the recent studies have shattered this myth beyond doubt beginning with Human Genome Project.\nHuman Genome Project (1990-2003)\nThis project involved six of the world's wealthiest countries, including the U.S., Japan, China, Germany, France, and the UK. The U.S. alone invested 3 billion dollars in the project, which aimed to map an individual's genome and predict their medical future, similar to a medical horoscope. However, the results revealed a surprising complexity, with human genes outnumbering expectations by a hundredfold. The mystery unraveled when it was discovered that the human body contains about 38 trillion foreign cells, mainly microbes in the colon, outnumbering its own 37 trillion human cells. These microbes, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other organisms, constitute our microbiota, with their genetic material forming our microbiome, significantly influenced by our diet and lifestyle.\nHuman Microbiome Project (2007 - Present)\nTo study the effects of bacteria on our health another project was undertaken in 2007 called the Human Microbiome Project. This resulted in a major shift in how we perceive and address health problems. For example we learned that:\n1. Identical twins can be as much as 70% apart due to changes in their diet and lifestyle.\n2. The same cause can manifest as different symptoms among different people.\n3. The same symptoms can stem from different causes in different people.\n4. Diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science, often with hits and misses.\nThis new science is creating a whole new field of fecal transplantation. For example studies have shown that a fecal transplantation from a slim mouse into the colon of a fat mouse can make it lose weight easily within months. This is an active frontier in medical science today.\nEpigenetics was featured on the cover of TIME magazine in January 2010. A helpful way to grasp the distinction between genetics and epigenetics is to think of it in terms of a mobile phone's hardware and its application software. Essentially, the hardware in all mobile phones is quite similar regardless of the manufacturer. Yet, the phone's functionality and appearance can vary significantly depending on the software it runs. In a similar vein, while our genetic makeup (like the phone's hardware) is fundamentally the same, epigenetics (akin to the software) determines how these genes are expressed, leading to notable differences from one individual to another.\nAmerican Gut Project (2013-2018)\nAnother project, the American Gut Project, started in 2013, analyzed gut microbiome data from people from 45 countries. The findings released in 2018 unveiled many surprises. The study divided people into two groups—one consuming 10 or less plant-based foods and the other consuming over 30 different plant food varieties. The study found that the first group suffered from many metabolic diseases and had low immunity, while the second group had few diseases and rarely suffered from viral infections.\nMyth: IT IS ALL YOUR FAULT (Overeating and Lack of Exercise)\nWhen we visit a doctor and our first lifestyle disease is diagnosed (generally high Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, or Cholesterol), the doctors put the blame squarely on us saying “You are eating too much and not exercising enough\" commonly referred to as \"gluttony and sloth.\" The doctors don’t explain why we are doing so; it's not taught to them in medical colleges.\nThe reason is simple: we are eating the wrong foods. Ultraprocessed foods are designed for overconsumption by Ph.D.s in psychology. They circumvent our body’s satiation mechanism.\nI remember the night Al Gore lost US presidential election to Bush in November 2000, I was in Mumbai and bought a pint of Mumbai’s famous Natural’s custard apple ice cream. The election results were so close and interesting that I finished the whole pint of ice cream without even realizing it. I didn’t achieve the satiation point. My stomach was sick but mind wanted more. This is what is happening to most of us. We are not suicidal and we are not overeating by choice. The food is designed for over consumption. Somebody is profiting from it and got us captive.\nDr. Robert Lustig of University of California, SanFrancisco has dedicated his life to research on this subject on obese children. He has found that when insulin levels are high (from overeating refined carbs), our body conserves energy and is less inclined to engage in physical activity. All these obese kids wanted to do was eat chips, cookies, ice cream and drink Cola and watch TV. They had no interest in playing outdoors. When their food was changed and insulin level reduced by medication, they started going out to play. We must understand that it is not our fault and it is definitely not a character flaw like gluttony and sloth in us as we are told. It is also the same ultra-processed foods (caloric dense nutrient poor) that make us deficient in nutrients. So as you can see the problem is not us the problem is the food.\nMyth: THE SOIL IS DEPLETED SO YOU NEED SUPPLEMENTS\nThe food supplements industry is $164 billion in the U.S. alone. There is some validity to the argument that due to damming of rivers and single crop farming, the soil has become depleted of many trace minerals. Plants produced today may not be as rich in nutrients as a century ago, but instead of taking supplements, increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can overcome these deficiencies.\nAs it is, our consumption of fresh produce has become a fraction of just two generations ago. So by simply increasing our consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables all deficiencies can be overcome. There is no need for supplements. The only exception is Vitamin B12 which our body made in the presence of a certain bacteria found in soil and ground water. As municipal supplies of water is chlorinated we do not get that bacteria.\nOne must also understand that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about but how about the nutrients that are not-yet-known (NYKnowns). They are missing from the supplements and therefore supplements often cause imbalances.\nOne classic example of this is a study that showed that cardiac patients who were given Beta Carotene supplements died earlier compared to the control group. This was because, (as we now know) there are 750 different carotenoids of which human body needs 50. By supplementing only Beta Carotene (known nutrient) body developed deficiency in other 49 carotenoids (NYKnowns at the time).\nIn conclusion, eating a diverse variety of plant foods, avoiding processed refined foods, and supplements, and listening to your body's signals are key to achieving a proper nutrient balance.",

        "content": "•Myth: BETTER SAFE THAN SORRY•\nWhat does “better safe than sorry” mean to you?\nMost people believe it is safer to continue taking certain medications rather than risk slightly elevated blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol levels. But WHAT IF THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.\nIn recent years, many senior doctors have realized that we've swung too far towards medicating lifestyle diseases. Studies from the past two decades suggest that excessive medication can often be more harmful than no medication at all. This phenomenon is known as the J-Curve. Progressive doctors have been vocal against overmedication for controlling blood pressure, sugar, and cholesterol. As a result, guidelines for medication thresholds have been revised. However, these changes haven't been widely disseminated, leading many doctors to follow outdated guidelines.\nLater in this blog, I'll present evidence supporting the revision of these guidelines towards more moderate medication thresholds. We'll also delve into the politics of the pharmaceutical, food, and healthcare industries, and examine the roles government and media play in our health.\nEmerging evidence shows that previous approaches were flawed and potentially more harmful. Many doctors are now reevaluating their recommendations for treatment and testing. The increased specialization in medicine often leads to tunnel vision, neglecting the overall quality of life and mortality. Furthermore, our understanding of drug interactions is limited, and prescriptions from multiple specialists can lead to Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs). I'll cover ADRs more in future blogs.\nHuman Body is Self Healing\n\"The human body is a remarkable self-healing mechanism, often smarter than we acknowledge. It adeptly copes with the diet and lifestyle it encounters. Elevated blood pressure, sugar, or cholesterol levels are often the body’s compensatory responses to various conditions.\nHowever, the body struggles with synthetic medications. These substances are foreign and can disrupt the body's natural compensatory mechanisms. Moreover, they place a strain on the liver and kidneys, affecting them in ways not fully understood.\nTo be safe, it's advisable to first address diet and lifestyle changes, allowing the body to naturally adjust these health markers. Of course, always seek medical advice and discuss your preferences with your doctor.\nJ -CURVE Concept\nIt's well-known that symptoms like high blood pressure or blood sugar are detrimental to health and, if uncontrolled, can lead to a shortened lifespan. Diseases typically follow a slanted S-curve, indicating that minor deviations from normal levels are less harmful and more manageable than more severe deviations. The impact on life expectancy isn't linear; a slight worsening of health markers is more concerning at advanced levels. For instance, a 10% increase in systolic blood pressure from 120 to 132 is concerning, but not alarmingly so. However, a 10% rise from 140 to 154 is significantly worrying. If it jumps 10% from 190 to 209, it becomes critical and demands immediate action.\nWe also know that all medications  have some negative side effects which may reduce our life expectancy. So clearly minimizing or eliminating medications should be a goal. Some BP patients are on a single pill which may not be as harmful, but some are on 6-7 different pills just for controlling BP. That situation is not at all desirable and if the person is also on diabetic or statin medications, it can harm in ways we do not fully understand.\nGiven the considerations mentioned, many senior doctors are now questioning the wisdom of stringently controlling health markers with aggressive medication. Recent studies have been conducted to assess the impact of such medications and disease markers on overall life expectancy. These studies indicate that optimal results are often achieved with a moderate approach.\nACCORD Study\nThe Action to Control Cardiovascular Risk in Diabetes (ACCORD) study, initiated in September 1999 and sponsored by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is a significant example. This study aimed to examine the effects of intensive glycemic control, blood pressure management, and multiple lipid management on major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, or cardiovascular death) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study, a landmark in its field, was supported by several collaborators:\n- National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)\n- National Institute on Aging (NIA)\n- National Eye Institute (NEI)\n- Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\nThe researchers initially hoped that tighter control of blood sugar and blood pressure would enhance life expectancy. However, within eight years, it became evident that such stringent controls were, in fact, increasing all-cause mortality rates among patients. Consequently, the duration of the study was curtailed, as it would have been unethical to continue exposing patients to such risks. The chart below presents the raw data from the ACCORD study, which the American College of Physicians (ACP) used to revise their diabetes guidelines in 2018. It is noteworthy that even they took a decade to update their guidelines.\nThe link to their announcement of March 6, 2018 is given below.\nhttps://www.acponline.org/acp-newsroom/acp-recommends-moderate-blood-sugar-control-targets-for-most-patients-with-type-2-diabetes\nAfter the ACCORD study, many doctors called for a revision of the guidelines for blood pressure and blood sugar medications. In response, the Joint National Committee on Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC-8) revised its blood pressure control guidelines in 2014 as shown below.\nThe American College of Physicians updated their diabetes guidelines in March 2018. Both revisions faced objections from those whose income was most affected. In US, the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) was pressured to disband the JNC, which had served for over four decades and transfer authority to the American Heart Association (AHA) and the American College of Cardiology (ACC).\nThe American College of Physicians (ACP) 2018 diabetes guideline revision alarmed the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) so much so that they reinstated their own, more restrictive guidelines within seven days. I will discuss these issues in more detail in the coming months under the topic of the Politics of Diet & Health. For now, my aim is to inform you about the J-Curve and why it occurs. Many of you may not be aware of these recent revisions and could be overmedicating. I recommend discussing this with your healthcare providers as soon as possible.",

        "content": "••• PROTEIN MYTH •••\nThere are many myths related to protein in our society propagated, knowingly or unknowingly, by many in the food and healthcare industries. These myths include the belief that\n* The human body needs a lot of protein\n* Protein is hard to find in food\n* Plant protein is somehow inferior to animal protein and doesn’t contain all amino acids.\nEven the United State's Food & Drug Administration (FDA), in its MyPlate guidelines, suggests the need for special foods to consume protein, as implied in their recommendations below.\nThe problem with this MyPlate recommendation is that fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy all contain protein, creating a misconception that special foods are necessary. The past head of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health criticized these guidelines as \"utterly ridiculous.\"\nHere are some facts pointing to the opposite conclusion:\n- The human body needs very little protein, as evidenced by the low protein content in mother's milk, which fuels newborns who are at the fastest growth stage of their life.\n-All proteins are made up of 20 amino acids in a chain configuration. Our body is able to make 11 but the remaining nine amino acids have to be consumed. For that reason they are called essential. It has been a long held myth that some of these nine are absent from some plant foods. For example it was believed that rice does not have lysine and beans do not have methionine. It is for this reason it was recommended that grains and beans should be combined in a balanced diet.\nWe now know that plant proteins contain all essential amino acids, but their distribution varies among food groups. Eating from all five food groups ensures no deficiency. However it is still a good idea to combine beans & legumes with grains as in daal-chawal (legume-rice) or Idli or Khichri.\n- Protein is abundantly found in plant foods. For example, as a percentage of total calories, rice has 7%, watermelon 8%, guava 14%, romaine lettuce 19%, and spinach 30%. Potatoes have a similar protein content to mother's milk at 5-6%.\nHistory of Protein\nProtein was discovered in 1839 by German scientist Gerardus Johannes Mulder and named for the Greek word Proteios, meaning \"of prime importance.\" The US Government, in 1947, established the minimum protein requirement for humans at 5-6% of total calories, They were so concerned about protein deficiency (due to popular beliefs that physical labor and gym enthusiasts need more protein) that they wanted to include 98% of the population in their Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) and therefore recommended a high figure of 8-10 percent of total calories requirement which amounted to 0.8 gram per kilogram of body weight. This amounts to 48 grams (240 calories) for a person weighing 60 kilograms or 10% (assuming 2,400 total calories a day). We did not know until 1899 that plant foods also have protein. For a long time plant protein was considered inferior to animal protein because it was believed to lack all essential amino acids which is incorrect.\nHuman Proteome Project (2011-Now)\nMost people know about a project called the “Human Genome Project” which was undertaken in 1990. Few are aware of “Human Proteome Project” that was undertaken a few years later to map all the proteins in human body. The science emerging from this ongoing project is called Proteomics. For reasons unknown to me, the findings of the Proteome project are not picked up by the mass media or social media much. I believe it may have something to do with its potential impact on the food industry especially meat, poultry and dairy. Here is what we now know about proteins in the human body:\n* Most humans need very little protein, only about 8% of their total calories.\n* An average adult body produces around 250 grams of new proteins daily and breaks down a similar amount due to wear and tear.\n* The body efficiently recycles spent proteins into amino acids for new protein synthesis, but certain proteins like nails, hair, and dead skin cannot be recycled, resulting in a 15% shortfall from the daily requirement for individuals burning 2,400 calories, equivalent to 36 grams.\n* The US Government's conservative recommendation of 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight covers 98% of the population, potentially leading to overconsumption by 97% of the population, statistically speaking.\n* Excessive protein, especially from animal sources, can be harmful to the liver and kidneys, shortening their healthy lifespan.\n* Periodic protein absence as during fasting, promotes autophagy (the recycling of dead and damaged cells). Dr. Yoshinori Ohsumi received the 2016 Nobel Prize for his discoveries.\n* Prolonged protein absence (9-10 days) can contribute to building immunity against major diseases like cancer as acknowledged by the 2018 Nobel Prize given to Dr. Tasuku Honjo. Practices like the Navratri fast among Hindus and Peryushan fast among Jains share this health objective.\n* Individuals who perform intense workouts or manual labor obtain extra protein through increased calorie consumption, eliminating the need for richer protein foods as the body efficiently recycles most excess spent protein generated during exercise.\nRecommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) or Minimum\nThe food industry in its zeal to sell more animal food, distorted the minimum and recommended guidelines established by the US government and somehow the recommended amount was labeled as the minimum. Even leading universities, which are now mostly governed by Food and Drug Industries, are guilty of these distortions as you can see by performing a google search on “protein”. Until recently this search revealed that these distortions appear on prestigious web sites such as Healthline, WebMD and Harvard Health, which I quote below:\n“The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for protein is a modest 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. The RDA is the amount of a nutrient you need to meet your basic nutritional requirements. In a sense, it’s the minimum amount you need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount you are supposed to eat every day.”\nThe above statement was a total lie. The site has now been revised and shows a lower recommendation of 0.8 gram per kilogram only. It may surprise you to note that there is not a single recorded case of protein deficiency in the civilized world.  Ninety seven percent of all Americans eat too much protein while at the same time 97% of all American diets are deficient in dietary fiber. Fiber is not found in any animal food or ultra-processed food. The nutrient of concern therefore should be fiber and not protein. Sadly press coverages on dangers of excessive protein consumption do not exist and the topic is conveniently ignored by mass media. This is in spite of doctors such as Dr. Colin Campbell (Cornel University), Dr Christopher Gardner (Stanford University) and Dr.Janice Stanger (UCLA) speaking about it at major conferences and in various documentaries and YouTube videos.\nWhy is Animal Protein Harmful?\nAll animal protein comes with the IGF-1 hormone. This hormone helps animals grow rapidly. For example a 50 pound newborn calf becomes a 500 pound bull in 6 months. The IGF-1 hormone is very harmful in humans as it promotes growth of cancer cells which are already present in the body fluids of most people living in the civilized world.\nTo make my point I like to give an example of a popular fertilizer in the United States called “Miracle Grow”. This fertilizer makes lawn grow very lush and green. However the lawn does not grow any taller. The thickness of the lawn depends upon the variety of the grass. It would only rise few inches above the soil. But if there are any weeds in the lawn, miracle grow makes them grow very tall very fast. This is because the weeds do not have auto truncating mechanism in their genes. Similarly human body has a built in truncating mechanism dictated by our genes. Our ring finger cannot become longer than the middle finger. When we consume IGF-1 hormone, it expedites the growth but our body cannot grow disproportionately. However any cancer cells, that are present in our body, do grow rapidly in the presence of IGF-1 hormone. This is why cancer growth gets promoted upon consumption of the IGF-1 hormone that accompanies animal protein.\nA study by Padambhushan Dr. Gopalan and Madhavan at the National Institute of Nutrition, Hyderabad in 1967 had demonstrated that, in the presence of carcinogens and sufficient food, animal protein can cause cancer cells to grow (we will discuss this more when we discuss the dairy myth).\nStudies also show associations between animal protein consumption and increased renal cancer cases, elevated LDL cholesterol and higher blood sugar levels.\nWhy is Excess Protein Harmful?\nOf the three macronutrients that provide energy to sustain life, only protein has nitrogen. The others, carbohydrates and fat, are made up of only carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. Our body has subcutaneous fat cells that can store an almost unlimited amount of fat; it can also store up to 2,000 calories of sugar but it has no provision to store protein.\nWhen we eat more protein than needed, which most of us in the civilized world do, our body faces a problem: What do we do with that extra protein? The liver, which is the chemical factory in our body, removes the nitrogen from the protein and makes fat and ammonia (NH3). Ammonia is toxic, so the body combines it with water and converts it to uric acid.\nThe kidneys then filter it out as urine. This taxes two of our critical organs: the kidney and liver. This is a leading cause for kidney and liver failures at later stages in life in the civilized world. Additionally, when there is excess uric acid it crystallizes and the body tries to move it as far away as possible and deposits it into the big toe as uric acid crystals. This condition is called gout. Many French paintings from the Renaissance period show over weight royalties suffering from this disease.\nAs a society our protein consumption (from meat, eggs and dairy) has increased multi fold in the past seven decades after World War 2. This has led to the growth of many lifestyle diseases like Hypertension, Diabetes, Heart diseases, Strokes, Dementia, Kidney and Liver diseases.\nAnti-Aging Benefits of Protein Restriction\nRecent research in the anti-aging field suggests that of all the major factors helping with anti-aging, restrictions on protein consumption is the most important. It helps in many ways including\n1. Improves immunity\n2. Decreases Oxidative stress\n3. Decreases Inflammation\n4. Decreases Insulin Resistance\n5. Decreases cancer promoting growth hormones\nThe latest book by Dr. Greger “How Not To Age” deals with this subject in detail and I highly recommend it.\nBenefits of Occasional Protein Deficiency\nThe two Nobel prizes on fasting in 2016 and 2018 have demonstrated that absences of protein during fasting is very beneficial for human health. It leads to autophagy, whereby the body recycles its dead and damaged cells to get amino acids and make new cells. The net effect is that the body’s average cell age reduces. It is for this reason I recommend that one should keep Ekadashi and Navratri fasts. We will cover this subject in detail when we discuss the second pillar of health: Detoxification.\nPersonal Case History\nThe Protein myth has been so prevalent in our society that I am reminded of the 1950’s when my grandfather insisted that I drink a glass of milk every morning with an egg yolk (not to mention the sugar which was always added to milk in India in those days). While I hated drinking it, I had no choice in the matter. Little did my grandfather know that he was causing me harm. He had the best of intentions and, based on the prevalent wisdom at the time, he was doing the right thing.\nProtein for Muscles?\nAnother misconception about protein is that eating protein builds muscles. If it was so easy, every man would look like Arnold Schwarzenegger. Muscles develop when we exercise them. The famous gladiators of the Roman period 2,000 years ago, who had to fight for life every day, were all vegans. Please watch the documentary “The Game Changers”. This is also discussed in the documentary “Forks over Knives”.\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the emphasis on protein consumption, especially from animal sources, has led to widespread misconceptions and health issues in our society. It is crucial to reevaluate dietary guidelines and focus on a balanced and plant-based approach for overall well-being.\nPlease read Dr. John McDougall’s article on the subject and\nwatch the talk about no the dangers of excessive protein and animal protein in the following videos by Dr. Janice Stanger of UCLA and Dr. Christopher Gardner of Stanford University and Dr. Colin Campbell. 👇\nDr. Janice Stanger of UCLA: The Dangerous Truth About Protein\nhttps://youtu.be/2R07FL1wVo4\nDr. Christopher Gardner of Stanford University: Everything You Thought You Knew About Protein Is Wrong",

there from just so many different sources and from just so many different sources and from just so many different sources and one of them is actually all our own one of them is actually all our own one of them is actually all our own government the US Department of government the US Department of government the US Department of Agriculture so let's start out looking Agriculture so let's start out looking Agriculture so let's start out looking at that one at that one at that one so protein is an icon and there's so protein is an icon and there's so protein is an icon and there's something very peculiar about this plate something very peculiar about this plate something very peculiar about this plate this plate is called to choose my plate this plate is called to choose my plate this plate is called to choose my plate it's the usda's latest version of what it's the usda's latest version of what it's the usda's latest version of what we're all supposed to be eating and we're all supposed to be eating and we're all supposed to be eating and there's a lot of fallacies on this plate there's a lot of fallacies on this plate there's a lot of fallacies on this plate for example the dairy fallacy that we're for example the dairy fallacy that we're for example the dairy fallacy that we're not talking about tonight but the oddest not talking about tonight but the oddest not talking about tonight but the oddest thing about this plate which really thing about this plate which really thing about this plate which really struck me very strongly the first time I struck me very strongly the first time I struck me very strongly the first time I saw it is that protein is broken out as saw it is that protein is broken out as saw it is that protein is broken out as the only nutrient on this plate so if the only nutrient on this plate so if the only nutrient on this plate so if you look at what the USDA is telling us you look at what the USDA is telling us you look at what the USDA is telling us to eat everything else on here is a food to eat everything else on here is a food to eat everything else on here is a food right you could go to the supermarket right you could go to the supermarket right you could go to the supermarket you could find it you could point to it you could find it you could point to it you could find it you could point to it you could go that's a vegetable that's a you could go that's a vegetable that's a you could go that's a vegetable that's a grain that's Dairy you can't do that grain that's Dairy you can't do that grain that's Dairy you can't do that with protein so the mindset they're with protein so the mindset they're with protein so the mindset they're trying to establish here is their trying to establish here is their trying to establish here is their protein is so rare that you actually protein is so rare that you actually protein is so rare that you actually have to get special foods to get it and have to get special foods to get it and have to get special foods to get it and it kind of tells you implicitly that it kind of tells you implicitly that it kind of tells you implicitly that there's no protein in your vegetables there's no protein in your vegetables there's no protein in your vegetables fruits grains or even in your Dairy fruits grains or even in your Dairy fruits grains or even in your Dairy because it's something that's so because it's something that's so because it's something that's so uncommon so what does that lead to it uncommon so what does that lead to it uncommon so what does that lead to it leads to a lot of things in terms of leads to a lot of things in terms of leads to a lot of things in terms of business you can see here this is an business you can see here this is an business you can see here this is an aisle that's in just about any aisle that's in just about any aisle that's in just about any Supermarket these days this Supermarket Supermarket these days this Supermarket Supermarket these days this Supermarket kind of comically calls it the nutrition kind of comically calls it the nutrition kind of comically calls it the nutrition aisle because it's actually more like aisle because it's actually more like aisle because it's actually more like the anti nutrition aisle but what you the anti nutrition aisle but what you the anti nutrition aisle but what you see here are all kinds of protein see here are all kinds of protein see here are all kinds of protein products a lot of them are powders I products a lot of them are powders I products a lot of them are powders I mean I'm sure you've all seen this mean I'm sure you've all seen this mean I'm sure you've all seen this aisles are going almost forever with aisles are going almost forever with aisles are going almost forever with protein powders a lot of them are from protein powders a lot of them are from protein powders a lot of them are from whey which is actually a byproduct of whey which is actually a byproduct of whey which is actually a byproduct of making cheese a lot of them are also making cheese a lot of them are also making cheese a lot of them are also Source from different kind of plants and Source from different kind of plants and Source from different kind of plants and they're also put into not just powders they're also put into not just powders they're also put into not just powders but brownies and food bars and but brownies and food bars and but brownies and food bars and everything else you can think of so everything else you can think of so everything else you can think of so again this is highly profitable and again this is highly profitable and again this is highly profitable and people really are kind of making a lot people really are kind of making a lot people really are kind of making a lot of money off this misinformation about of money off this misinformation about of money off this misinformation about protein but luckily there's a new protein but luckily there's a new protein but luckily there's a new science now and it's called science now and it's called science now and it's called proteomics and proteomics is something proteomics and proteomics is something proteomics and proteomics is something that will give us a lot more good that will give us a lot more good that will give us a lot more good information so let's look at some of the information so let's look at some of the information so let's look at some of the basic facts this this science came to be basic facts this this science came to be basic facts this this science came to be in about very recently but actually the in about very recently but actually the in about very recently but actually the discovery of protein goes back to 1838 discovery of protein goes back to 1838 discovery of protein goes back to 1838 175 years ago two European scientists 175 years ago two European scientists 175 years ago two European scientists discover protein and they gave it this discover protein and they gave it this discover protein and they gave it this name because they thought it was very name because they thought it was very name because they thought it was very important because the cons Greek word important because the cons Greek word important because the cons Greek word meaning of prime importance and there a meaning of prime importance and there a meaning of prime importance and there a lot of misinformation started swirling lot of misinformation started swirling lot of misinformation started swirling at that time and unfortunately it's at that time and unfortunately it's at that time and unfortunately it's still out there so let's really start still out there so let's really start still out there so let's really start seeing some of the basic facts okay so I seeing some of the basic facts okay so I seeing some of the basic facts okay so I want to ask you this so how many kinds want to ask you this so how many kinds want to ask you this so how many kinds of protein do you Sinker in your body of protein do you Sinker in your body of protein do you Sinker in your body you being the average person okay so you being the average person okay so you being the average person okay so we'll just do this by show hands cuz we'll just do this by show hands cuz we'll just do this by show hands cuz there's kind of too many people to count there's kind of too many people to count there's kind of too many people to count so how many people think they have one so how many people think they have one so how many people think they have one to9 999 kinds of protein in their to9 999 kinds of protein in their to9 999 kinds of protein in their body okay how many people think they body okay how many people think they body okay how many people think they have 100 to 9.99 that one's a little less popular 9.99 that one's a little less popular how many think they have a th000 up to how many think they have a th000 up to how many think they have a th000 up to close to close to close to 10,000 okay and how many think they have 10,000 okay and how many think they have 10,000 okay and how many think they have over over over 10,000 okay pretty good so I'd say about 10,000 okay pretty good so I'd say about 10,000 okay pretty good so I'd say about half the people think they have over half the people think they have over half the people think they have over 10,000 and about half think they have 10,000 and about half think they have 10,000 and about half think they have under under under 10,000 in fact according to American 10,000 in fact according to American 10,000 in fact according to American Medical Association we each have about 2 Medical Association we each have about 2 Medical Association we each have about 2 million kinds of protein in our body and million kinds of protein in our body and million kinds of protein in our body and we'll see soon why that can be when we we'll see soon why that can be when we we'll see soon why that can be when we see what protein's made of why you could see what protein's made of why you could see what protein's made of why you could actually have so many and it doesn't actually have so many and it doesn't actually have so many and it doesn't even begin to put a small dent in the even begin to put a small dent in the even begin to put a small dent in the kinds of protein that could kinds of protein that could kinds of protein that could theoretically be made so of every 100 theoretically be made so of every 100 theoretically be made so of every 100 calories in human breast milk how many calories in human breast milk how many calories in human breast milk how many calories come from protein this would be calories come from protein this would be calories come from protein this would be the milk that a nursing mother produces the milk that a nursing mother produces the milk that a nursing mother produces so how many people think it's one to so how many people think it's one to so how many people think it's one to four four four calories okay not too many how many calories okay not too many how many calories okay not too many how many think it's 5 think it's 5 think it's 5 to8 okay how many think the mom has 9 to to8 okay how many think the mom has 9 to to8 okay how many think the mom has 9 to 15 calories worth of protein and how 15 calories worth of protein and how 15 calories worth of protein and how many think 16 or many think 16 or many think 16 or more okay that's a vast majority of more okay that's a vast majority of more okay that's a vast majority of people the correct answer is actually B people the correct answer is actually B people the correct answer is actually B so in a nursing infant one of the main so in a nursing infant one of the main so in a nursing infant one of the main functions of protein in the body is to functions of protein in the body is to functions of protein in the body is to fuel growth so the time of life when fuel growth so the time of life when fuel growth so the time of life when we're growing the fastest which is in we're growing the fastest which is in we're growing the fastest which is in infancy infancy infancy actually only 5 to 8% of the calories actually only 5 to 8% of the calories actually only 5 to 8% of the calories that the infant is consuming come from that the infant is consuming come from that the infant is consuming come from protein so that should tell you a little protein so that should tell you a little protein so that should tell you a little bit about our protein nutritional bit about our protein nutritional bit about our protein nutritional needs but there is something very needs but there is something very needs but there is something very special about protein so the people who special about protein so the people who special about protein so the people who think protein's very special they're think protein's very special they're think protein's very special they're actually onto a truth here which is that actually onto a truth here which is that actually onto a truth here which is that protein equals life so the part of you protein equals life so the part of you protein equals life so the part of you that's alive the part of you that that's alive the part of you that that's alive the part of you that breathes and thinks and reproduces and breathes and thinks and reproduces and breathes and thinks and reproduces and eats and does all that good stuff eats and does all that good stuff eats and does all that good stuff actually is the protein part of you actually is the protein part of you actually is the protein part of you because the other parts of you like because the other parts of you like because the other parts of you like water and minerals actually aren't water and minerals actually aren't water and minerals actually aren't alive and this is true this is the alive and this is true this is the alive and this is true this is the important thing it's true not just of important thing it's true not just of important thing it's true not just of animals but it's true of plants so we animals but it's true of plants so we animals but it's true of plants so we all know plants are alive and the part all know plants are alive and the part all know plants are alive and the part of plants that's living are also their of plants that's living are also their of plants that's living are also their proteins and proteins different proteins proteins and proteins different proteins proteins and proteins different proteins are what makes each species unique from are what makes each species unique from are what makes each species unique from each other species and also makes every each other species and also makes every each other species and also makes every single individual within that species single individual within that species single individual within that species unique from every other individual so let's see why that is and individual so let's see why that is and the reason it is and the reason you can the reason it is and the reason you can the reason it is and the reason you can have so many millions of kinds of have so many millions of kinds of have so many millions of kinds of proteins is because they're link chains proteins is because they're link chains proteins is because they're link chains so I just happened to so I just happened to so I just happened to bring a protein chain with me to kind of bring a protein chain with me to kind of bring a protein chain with me to kind of illustrate this fact so here's my little illustrate this fact so here's my little illustrate this fact so here's my little protein chain and in actuality the protein chain and in actuality the protein chain and in actuality the protein chain would be a lot longer protein chain would be a lot longer protein chain would be a lot longer because there's hundreds to thousands of because there's hundreds to thousands of because there's hundreds to thousands of these little little links in each these little little links in each these little little links in each protein chain so the chain itself is a protein chain so the chain itself is a protein chain so the chain itself is a protein so what are the little links protein so what are the little links protein so what are the little links this is the most important thing we're this is the most important thing we're this is the most important thing we're getting to the little links are called getting to the little links are called getting to the little links are called amino amino amino acids okay so these amino acids when acids okay so these amino acids when acids okay so these amino acids when they're linked together kind of like they're linked together kind of like they're linked together kind of like they're length in this chain and then they're length in this chain and then they're length in this chain and then they get folded a certain way are what they get folded a certain way are what they get folded a certain way are what make up a make up a make up a protein so you really don't need protein protein so you really don't need protein protein so you really don't need protein at all what you need are amino acids at all what you need are amino acids at all what you need are amino acids because remember your amino acids are because remember your amino acids are because remember your amino acids are unique and so if you if not your Amino unique and so if you if not your Amino unique and so if you if not your Amino your proteins are unique and your amino your proteins are unique and your amino your proteins are unique and your amino acids are what make up your protein so acids are what make up your protein so acids are what make up your protein so since your protein is unique you can't since your protein is unique you can't since your protein is unique you can't get that protein by eating any kind of get that protein by eating any kind of get that protein by eating any kind of food plant or animal because the animal food plant or animal because the animal food plant or animal because the animal you eat or the plant you eat is going to you eat or the plant you eat is going to you eat or the plant you eat is going to have very different protein from yours have very different protein from yours have very different protein from yours but it's going to be made of these same but it's going to be made of these same but it's going to be made of these same amino amino amino acids okay is that making sense Okay cool so let's see see why your proteins cool so let's see see why your proteins are put together the way they are are put together the way they are are put together the way they are they're put together the way they are they're put together the way they are they're put together the way they are for a number of different reasons but for a number of different reasons but for a number of different reasons but the most important is your genes there's the most important is your genes there's the most important is your genes there's also dietary and environmental also dietary and environmental also dietary and environmental influences on which genes get expressed influences on which genes get expressed influences on which genes get expressed which means which proteins are put which means which proteins are put which means which proteins are put together so as I talked about there's together so as I talked about there's together so as I talked about there's hundreds of thousands of aminos in each hundreds of thousands of aminos in each hundreds of thousands of aminos in each of these chains and where do you get of these chains and where do you get of these chains and where do you get these amino acids these amino acids these amino acids from well you get them from your from well you get them from your from well you get them from your food Okay so we do need to eat the amino food Okay so we do need to eat the amino food Okay so we do need to eat the amino acids we don't need to eat the proteins acids we don't need to eat the proteins acids we don't need to eat the proteins so we're starting to get the core of so we're starting to get the core of so we're starting to get the core of what we need to know to make better what we need to know to make better what we need to know to make better decisions to really understand what decisions to really understand what decisions to really understand what protein is and to make better decisions protein is and to make better decisions protein is and to make better decisions about it so where do these amino acids get it so where do these amino acids get made so now we're getting to the really made so now we're getting to the really made so now we're getting to the really fundamental question so you notice I fundamental question so you notice I fundamental question so you notice I have two colors on my little protein have two colors on my little protein have two colors on my little protein chain now there's actually 20 kinds of chain now there's actually 20 kinds of chain now there's actually 20 kinds of amino acids that make up all living amino acids that make up all living amino acids that make up all living things things whether they're plants or things things whether they're plants or things things whether they're plants or animals but for our purposes we can animals but for our purposes we can animals but for our purposes we can divide them into two kinds we don't divide them into two kinds we don't divide them into two kinds we don't we're not biochemist so we don't have to we're not biochemist so we don't have to we're not biochemist so we don't have to sit here and memorize the 20 kinds of sit here and memorize the 20 kinds of sit here and memorize the 20 kinds of amino acids we just need to know that amino acids we just need to know that amino acids we just need to know that some are some are some are non-essential and what is non-essential non-essential and what is non-essential non-essential and what is non-essential mean it means that you can make it mean it means that you can make it mean it means that you can make it yourself since you can make it yourself yourself since you can make it yourself yourself since you can make it yourself you don't need to get it from food you you don't need to get it from food you you don't need to get it from food you don't need to worry about it it's like don't need to worry about it it's like don't need to worry about it it's like anything else your body can make you anything else your body can make you anything else your body can make you just don't worry about it it does it just don't worry about it it does it just don't worry about it it does it without you even having a conscious without you even having a conscious without you even having a conscious thought about it the other amino acids thought about it the other amino acids thought about it the other amino acids are called essential amino acids and are called essential amino acids and are called essential amino acids and that means your body can't make them and that means your body can't make them and that means your body can't make them and that means you have to get them from that means you have to get them from that means you have to get them from food so we only really care about food so we only really care about food so we only really care about getting the essential amino acids so getting the essential amino acids so getting the essential amino acids so imagine in my little protein T that the imagine in my little protein T that the imagine in my little protein T that the amino acids the essential ones are green amino acids the essential ones are green amino acids the essential ones are green and the non-essential are red and you and the non-essential are red and you and the non-essential are red and you notice there's a mix of them that your notice there's a mix of them that your notice there's a mix of them that your body needs so where did the essential body needs so where did the essential body needs so where did the essential amino acid es come from that's probably amino acid es come from that's probably amino acid es come from that's probably the most important question in protein the most important question in protein the most important question in protein nutrition and it turns out again they nutrition and it turns out again they nutrition and it turns out again they are made by plants now why is that it's are made by plants now why is that it's are made by plants now why is that it's because the essential amino acids take a because the essential amino acids take a because the essential amino acids take a lot of metabolic energy they're hard to lot of metabolic energy they're hard to lot of metabolic energy they're hard to put together they take a huge amount of put together they take a huge amount of put together they take a huge amount of energy to put together plants are solar energy to put together plants are solar energy to put together plants are solar powered they're sitting out in the sun powered they're sitting out in the sun powered they're sitting out in the sun they're getting all this wonderful they're getting all this wonderful they're getting all this wonderful energy direct from the Sun and they're energy direct from the Sun and they're energy direct from the Sun and they're converting it they're able to use about converting it they're able to use about converting it they're able to use about 95% of the energy they get and so they 95% of the energy they get and so they 95% of the energy they get and so they have enough energy to make these have enough energy to make these have enough energy to make these essential amino acids animals do not essential amino acids animals do not essential amino acids animals do not have that much metabolic energy right have that much metabolic energy right have that much metabolic energy right they're not solar powered so all these they're not solar powered so all these they're not solar powered so all these essential amino acids come from plants essential amino acids come from plants essential amino acids come from plants every single one of them so what does every single one of them so what does every single one of them so what does that mean it means animal protein is that mean it means animal protein is that mean it means animal protein is nothing but recycled plant protein nothing but recycled plant protein nothing but recycled plant protein there's nothing in animal protein that there's nothing in animal protein that there's nothing in animal protein that is not in plant is not in plant is not in plant protein because the the animals got protein because the the animals got protein because the the animals got their essential amino acids by eating their essential amino acids by eating their essential amino acids by eating the plants remember they can't make the plants remember they can't make the plants remember they can't make them so another way to think of that is them so another way to think of that is them so another way to think of that is to say plants are the base of the food to say plants are the base of the food to say plants are the base of the food chain on planet Earth that means that chain on planet Earth that means that chain on planet Earth that means that plants are nutrient producers are the plants are nutrient producers are the plants are nutrient producers are the base of the food chain they're nutrient base of the food chain they're nutrient base of the food chain they're nutrient producers animals are not the base of producers animals are not the base of producers animals are not the base of the food chain that means animals are the food chain that means animals are the food chain that means animals are nutrient nutrient nutrient consumers very different role that consumers very different role that consumers very different role that Nature's thought for them so let's see Nature's thought for them so let's see Nature's thought for them so let's see another way to look at this another way to look at this another way to look at this so take a good look at this cow I want so take a good look at this cow I want so take a good look at this cow I want everybody to look at the Cow because everybody to look at the Cow because everybody to look at the Cow because this is another way of understanding it this is another way of understanding it this is another way of understanding it and remembering it and if there's one and remembering it and if there's one and remembering it and if there's one thing you remember from tonight I'd like thing you remember from tonight I'd like thing you remember from tonight I'd like you to be this picture of this cow and you to be this picture of this cow and you to be this picture of this cow and remember that this cow is eating remember that this cow is eating remember that this cow is eating essential amino acids this cow is not essential amino acids this cow is not essential amino acids this cow is not making any essential amino making any essential amino making any essential amino acids so if you eat animal products acids so if you eat animal products acids so if you eat animal products whether you choose to eat the cow's milk whether you choose to eat the cow's milk whether you choose to eat the cow's milk you can tell this is a dairy cow or you can tell this is a dairy cow or you can tell this is a dairy cow or whether you choose to eat her muscles or whether you choose to eat her muscles or whether you choose to eat her muscles or her organs or whatever part of her you her organs or whatever part of her you her organs or whatever part of her you eat whatever proteins you're getting eat whatever proteins you're getting eat whatever proteins you're getting from that in fact originally came from from that in fact originally came from from that in fact originally came from the plants that the cow ate at least all the plants that the cow ate at least all the plants that the cow ate at least all the essential amino acids came from the the essential amino acids came from the the essential amino acids came from the plants some of the non-essential ones plants some of the non-essential ones plants some of the non-essential ones the Cal might have made herself but you the Cal might have made herself but you the Cal might have made herself but you don't really need those cuz you can make don't really need those cuz you can make don't really need those cuz you can make them yourself so we're getting close to what yourself so we're getting close to what you need to know about protein to be you need to know about protein to be you need to know about protein to be able to go on and look at how can harm able to go on and look at how can harm able to go on and look at how can harm you uh your body suffers quite a bit you uh your body suffers quite a bit you uh your body suffers quite a bit when you have the wrong kinds of protein when you have the wrong kinds of protein when you have the wrong kinds of protein and too much protein and I'm going to and too much protein and I'm going to and too much protein and I'm going to look at just three ways this can happen look at just three ways this can happen look at just three ways this can happen there's actually more than three but there's actually more than three but there's actually more than three but we'll try to focus on the three main we'll try to focus on the three main we'll try to focus on the three main ones tonight and that should be enough ones tonight and that should be enough ones tonight and that should be enough to get you started so the first danger to get you started so the first danger to get you started so the first danger of protein is that when you have too of protein is that when you have too of protein is that when you have too much of the wrong kinds it can damage much of the wrong kinds it can damage much of the wrong kinds it can damage your liver and kidneys which are clearly your liver and kidneys which are clearly your liver and kidneys which are clearly essential organs an that you need to essential organs an that you need to essential organs an that you need to survive okay you can't live without survive okay you can't live without survive okay you can't live without those organs you actually have two those organs you actually have two those organs you actually have two kidneys and you don't need both of them kidneys and you don't need both of them kidneys and you don't need both of them but you do need enough kidney function but you do need enough kidney function but you do need enough kidney function to be able to clean your blood and get to be able to clean your blood and get to be able to clean your blood and get rid of waste and both these organs can rid of waste and both these organs can rid of waste and both these organs can be damaged and I show picture here this be damaged and I show picture here this be damaged and I show picture here this is actually a kidney because kidney is actually a kidney because kidney is actually a kidney because kidney disease is growing so rapidly and one disease is growing so rapidly and one disease is growing so rapidly and one reason it's growing so rapidly is reason it's growing so rapidly is reason it's growing so rapidly is because of the food we eat so this slide because of the food we eat so this slide because of the food we eat so this slide was actually taken very near here very was actually taken very near here very was actually taken very near here very recently and it's shopping center that's recently and it's shopping center that's recently and it's shopping center that's about 10 11

relates to this relates to this relates to protein so too much protein is a waste protein so too much protein is a waste protein so too much protein is a waste disposal disposal disposal process so here's the thing about amino process so here's the thing about amino process so here's the thing about amino acids too much protein equals too many acids too much protein equals too many acids too much protein equals too many amino acids because we already talked amino acids because we already talked amino acids because we already talked about what protein is so your body has about what protein is so your body has about what protein is so your body has to get rid of this protein everything to get rid of this protein everything to get rid of this protein everything you eat either you cannot absorb but if you eat either you cannot absorb but if you eat either you cannot absorb but if you absorb it then your body has to you absorb it then your body has to you absorb it then your body has to either use it or get rid of it and either use it or get rid of it and either use it or get rid of it and people don't think of this when they're people don't think of this when they're people don't think of this when they're taking large amounts of supplements or taking large amounts of supplements or taking large amounts of supplements or whatever but when you take too much it's whatever but when you take too much it's whatever but when you take too much it's nothing but a toxic waste disposal nothing but a toxic waste disposal nothing but a toxic waste disposal problem for your body and that's problem for your body and that's problem for your body and that's certainly true of protein as much as certainly true of protein as much as certainly true of protein as much as anything else because you have very anything else because you have very anything else because you have very limited room to store amino acids in limited room to store amino acids in limited room to store amino acids in your body the amount of room you have to your body the amount of room you have to your body the amount of room you have to store amino acids is actually largely store amino acids is actually largely store amino acids is actually largely dependent on your height it has dependent on your height it has dependent on your height it has virtually nothing to do with your diet virtually nothing to do with your diet virtually nothing to do with your diet taller people have a little more room taller people have a little more room taller people have a little more room and that makes sense cuz they have a and that makes sense cuz they have a and that makes sense cuz they have a little more body mass to support for the little more body mass to support for the little more body mass to support for the most part but it really you can't most part but it really you can't most part but it really you can't increase the amount of protein or amino increase the amount of protein or amino increase the amount of protein or amino acids your body stores by eating them acids your body stores by eating them acids your body stores by eating them and the other thing about protein is and the other thing about protein is and the other thing about protein is your body can't just burn it your body can't just burn it your body can't just burn it away and it can't store it in the form away and it can't store it in the form away and it can't store it in the form of protein and it can't burn it for fuel of protein and it can't burn it for fuel of protein and it can't burn it for fuel in the form of protein so how is it in the form of protein so how is it in the form of protein so how is it going to get rid of it it's like this going to get rid of it it's like this going to get rid of it it's like this overflowing trash can it's like you have overflowing trash can it's like you have overflowing trash can it's like you have your overflowing trash can there's been your overflowing trash can there's been your overflowing trash can there's been a strike nobody came to collect your a strike nobody came to collect your a strike nobody came to collect your trash and now you had a big party and trash and now you had a big party and trash and now you had a big party and you just don't even know where to put you just don't even know where to put you just don't even know where to put all this trash so that's kind of like all this trash so that's kind of like all this trash so that's kind of like the situation your body's in when you're the situation your body's in when you're the situation your body's in when you're getting too much protein and it makes getting too much protein and it makes getting too much protein and it makes your liver and kidneys work over time to your liver and kidneys work over time to your liver and kidneys work over time to get rid of it what happens to it well get rid of it what happens to it well get rid of it what happens to it well let's see and then you'll understand why let's see and then you'll understand why let's see and then you'll understand why this is so harmful now the first thing we have to harmful now the first thing we have to look at is what you can use and what you look at is what you can use and what you look at is what you can use and what you can save for fuel and that will really can save for fuel and that will really can save for fuel and that will really explain what happens to your protein so explain what happens to your protein so explain what happens to your protein so the first picture you see here is the first picture you see here is the first picture you see here is glucose and this is in a pure form glucose and this is in a pure form glucose and this is in a pure form usually when you eat food you're not usually when you eat food you're not usually when you eat food you're not eating glucose in a pure form glucose is eating glucose in a pure form glucose is eating glucose in a pure form glucose is one kind of sugar and there's multiple one kind of sugar and there's multiple one kind of sugar and there's multiple kinds of sugar again we don't have to kinds of sugar again we don't have to kinds of sugar again we don't have to worry about that cuz we're not doing worry about that cuz we're not doing worry about that cuz we're not doing biochemistry tonight but glucose is a biochemistry tonight but glucose is a biochemistry tonight but glucose is a form of sugar that your body prefers to form of sugar that your body prefers to form of sugar that your body prefers to burn as fuel and in fact it's the only burn as fuel and in fact it's the only burn as fuel and in fact it's the only fuel that your red blood cells can burn fuel that your red blood cells can burn fuel that your red blood cells can burn so your red blood cells which are so your red blood cells which are so your red blood cells which are necessary to carry oxygen cannot live necessary to carry oxygen cannot live necessary to carry oxygen cannot live without glucose your brain also has an without glucose your brain also has an without glucose your brain also has an extremely strong preference for glucose extremely strong preference for glucose extremely strong preference for glucose if it's really deprived of glucose if it's really deprived of glucose if it's really deprived of glucose there's some other kinds of fuel it can there's some other kinds of fuel it can there's some other kinds of fuel it can burn to limit extent but it won't be burn to limit extent but it won't be burn to limit extent but it won't be working very efficiently or effectively working very efficiently or effectively working very efficiently or effectively and it always does need some and it always does need some and it always does need some glucose so your body without enough glucose so your body without enough glucose so your body without enough glucose is like a city with the power glucose is like a city with the power glucose is like a city with the power outage like nothing happens it's the outage like nothing happens it's the outage like nothing happens it's the end and then the other nutrient your end and then the other nutrient your end and then the other nutrient your body knows what to do with and here I'm body knows what to do with and here I'm body knows what to do with and here I'm talking about macronutrients are sources talking about macronutrients are sources talking about macronutrients are sources of calories because remember proteins a of calories because remember proteins a of calories because remember proteins a source of calories so we've got the source of calories so we've got the source of calories so we've got the sugar and then the other thing we have sugar and then the other thing we have sugar and then the other thing we have is the fat now I'm not showing you this is the fat now I'm not showing you this is the fat now I'm not showing you this because I recommend you eat it I'm because I recommend you eat it I'm because I recommend you eat it I'm showing it to you so you understand that showing it to you so you understand that showing it to you so you understand that your body can store fat which probably your body can store fat which probably your body can store fat which probably we all know and your body can store we all know and your body can store we all know and your body can store actually hundreds and hundreds of pounds actually hundreds and hundreds of pounds actually hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat probably a lot more fat than any of fat probably a lot more fat than any of fat probably a lot more fat than any of us wanted to store right but you know of us wanted to store right but you know of us wanted to store right but you know so all these products you see in this so all these products you see in this so all these products you see in this picture are pure fat and your body knows picture are pure fat and your body knows picture are pure fat and your body knows what to do with it so again your body what to do with it so again your body what to do with it so again your body knows what to do with the glucose your knows what to do with the glucose your knows what to do with the glucose your body knows what to do with the fat and body knows what to do with the fat and body knows what to do with the fat and it can handle it but what about the it can handle it but what about the it can handle it but what about the protein and by the way I just told you protein and by the way I just told you protein and by the way I just told you proteins macronutrient which means it's proteins macronutrient which means it's proteins macronutrient which means it's a source of calories but I also told you a source of calories but I also told you a source of calories but I also told you your body can't burn protein so aren't I your body can't burn protein so aren't I your body can't burn protein so aren't I contradicting myself well let's see now here we're getting into a little see now here we're getting into a little bit of chemistry light don't be afraid bit of chemistry light don't be afraid bit of chemistry light don't be afraid of this if you didn't much like of this if you didn't much like of this if you didn't much like chemistry this is going to be very light chemistry this is going to be very light chemistry this is going to be very light chemistry and I'm very confident you'll chemistry and I'm very confident you'll chemistry and I'm very confident you'll all understand it so when we look at the all understand it so when we look at the all understand it so when we look at the amino acids you'll see you'll understand amino acids you'll see you'll understand amino acids you'll see you'll understand all this and you'll be able to see why all this and you'll be able to see why all this and you'll be able to see why the protein so harmful and why you're the protein so harmful and why you're the protein so harmful and why you're really wasting your money when you have really wasting your money when you have really wasting your money when you have too much of it if you're spending a lot too much of it if you're spending a lot too much of it if you're spending a lot of money for it so the first thing we're of money for it so the first thing we're of money for it so the first thing we're looking at here the thing in the upper looking at here the thing in the upper looking at here the thing in the upper left corner is actually an amino acid left corner is actually an amino acid left corner is actually an amino acid it's a representation of an amino acid it's a representation of an amino acid it's a representation of an amino acid and you can see the amino acids made and you can see the amino acids made and you can see the amino acids made from four from four from four substances there's the oxygen the carbon substances there's the oxygen the carbon substances there's the oxygen the carbon the hydrogen and the nitrogen okay the hydrogen and the nitrogen okay the hydrogen and the nitrogen okay that's what's making the amino acid now that's what's making the amino acid now that's what's making the amino acid now the thing that's special about the amino the thing that's special about the amino the thing that's special about the amino acid that differentiates from the other acid that differentiates from the other acid that differentiates from the other macronutrients is a nitrogen macronutrients is a nitrogen macronutrients is a nitrogen so your body doesn't want the nitrogen so your body doesn't want the nitrogen so your body doesn't want the nitrogen it can't really do much with the it can't really do much with the it can't really do much with the nitrogen so it just it just kind of nitrogen so it just it just kind of nitrogen so it just it just kind of chops it off okay so just think of it it chops it off okay so just think of it it chops it off okay so just think of it it kind of cuts the nitrogen off and we'll kind of cuts the nitrogen off and we'll kind of cuts the nitrogen off and we'll get to what it does to the nitrogen in a get to what it does to the nitrogen in a get to what it does to the nitrogen in a minute but the other three that are left minute but the other three that are left minute but the other three that are left which is the oxygen the carbon and the which is the oxygen the carbon and the which is the oxygen the carbon and the hydrogen your body knows exactly what to hydrogen your body knows exactly what to hydrogen your body knows exactly what to do with because think carbon oxygen do with because think carbon oxygen do with because think carbon oxygen hydrogen what does that sound hydrogen what does that sound hydrogen what does that sound like sounds like carbohydrates does is like sounds like carbohydrates does is like sounds like carbohydrates does is it very well- named macronutrient so if it very well- named macronutrient so if it very well- named macronutrient so if you're and glucose is one kind of you're and glucose is one kind of you're and glucose is one kind of carbohydrate it's a simple carbohydrate carbohydrate it's a simple carbohydrate carbohydrate it's a simple carbohydrate as we all know there's many simple as we all know there's many simple as we all know there's many simple carbohydrates and a lot more even carbohydrates and a lot more even carbohydrates and a lot more even complex complex complex carbohydrates so your body breaks down carbohydrates so your body breaks down carbohydrates so your body breaks down to the simple carbohydrates to burn for to the simple carbohydrates to burn for to the simple carbohydrates to burn for fuel which includes the glucose which is fuel which includes the glucose which is fuel which includes the glucose which is its preferred its preferred its preferred fuel so it takes this carbon oxygen and fuel so it takes this carbon oxygen and fuel so it takes this carbon oxygen and hydrogen if you're low on glucose hydrogen if you're low on glucose hydrogen if you're low on glucose because remember if you're low on because remember if you're low on because remember if you're low on glucose your survival is in danger and glucose your survival is in danger and glucose your survival is in danger and your body is way too smart to let you your body is way too smart to let you your body is way too smart to let you die because you don't have enough die because you don't have enough die because you don't have enough glucose it knows exactly what to do it's glucose it knows exactly what to do it's glucose it knows exactly what to do it's going to make more and that process is going to make more and that process is going to make more and that process is called glucon called glucon called glucon neogenesis and that's really not very neogenesis and that's really not very neogenesis and that's really not very hard to remember because it's gluco for hard to remember because it's gluco for hard to remember because it's gluco for glucose and then Neo means new and glucose and then Neo means new and glucose and then Neo means new and Genesis means make it so it just means Genesis means make it so it just means Genesis means make it so it just means you're kind of making new glucose that's you're kind of making new glucose that's you're kind of making new glucose that's all it means but that's kind of the all it means but that's kind of the all it means but that's kind of the scientific technical term is glucose scientific technical term is glucose scientific technical term is glucose neogenesis now what if you don't need neogenesis now what if you don't need neogenesis now what if you don't need glucose what if you've been needing glucose what if you've been needing glucose what if you've been needing adequate carbohydrates and your body adequate carbohydrates and your body adequate carbohydrates and your body also can store some very very limited also can store some very very limited also can store some very very limited amounts of glucose that'll last it about amounts of glucose that'll last it about amounts of glucose that'll last it about 20 minutes if you're 20 minutes if you're 20 minutes if you're exercising what if you already have all exercising what if you already have all exercising what if you already have all that you need and your body can't store that you need and your body can't store that you need and your body can't store any more glucose well then it takes any more glucose well then it takes any more glucose well then it takes these same elements and it just puts these same elements and it just puts these same elements and it just puts them together in a different way and it them together in a different way and it them together in a different way and it makes it into fat well it knows what to makes it into fat well it knows what to makes it into fat well it knows what to do with fat just stores it in case do with fat just stores it in case do with fat just stores it in case there's a famine next year and you'll there's a famine next year and you'll there's a famine next year and you'll make sure you'll have some calories to make sure you'll have some calories to make sure you'll have some calories to burn so that's what happens to that your burn so that's what happens to that your burn so that's what happens to that your body knows right what to do with it it's body knows right what to do with it it's body knows right what to do with it it's not really dangerous to you because not really dangerous to you because not really dangerous to you because those aren't really dangerous elements those aren't really dangerous elements those aren't really dangerous elements to have in your body but let's look at to have in your body but let's look at to have in your body but let's look at the nitrogen let's look what happens to the nitrogen let's look what happens to the nitrogen let's look what happens to the nitrogen and this is getting to the the nitrogen and this is getting to the the nitrogen and this is getting to the core of why you don't want to eat too core of why you don't want to eat too core of why you don't want to eat too much protein it's because of the nitrogen so the body has to get rid of nitrogen so the body has to get rid of the nitrogen it can't really do anything the nitrogen it can't really do anything the nitrogen it can't really do anything with it like it can with the other three with it like it can with the other three with it like it can with the other three elements so the nitrogen is going to elements so the nitrogen is going to elements so the nitrogen is going to react and the first part of this takes react and the first part of this takes react and the first part of this takes place in the liver and the second part place in the liver and the second part place in the liver and the second part takes place in your kidneys why which is takes place in your kidneys why which is takes place in your kidneys why which is why this process is very hard on those why this process is very hard on those why this process is very hard on those two two two organs so the nitrogen first thing that organs so the nitrogen first thing that organs so the nitrogen first thing that happens to it is it becomes happens to it is it becomes happens to it is it becomes ammonia now do we really want to drink ammonia now do we really want to drink ammonia now do we really want to drink ammonia have ammonia inside our bodies ammonia have ammonia inside our bodies ammonia have ammonia inside our bodies probably not ammonia is actually very probably not ammonia is actually very probably not ammonia is actually very toxic it's very poisonous I think toxic it's very poisonous I think toxic it's very poisonous I think everybody knows that and so you have everybody knows that and so you have everybody knows that and so you have this ammonia flood in your liver well this ammonia flood in your liver well this ammonia flood in your liver well would immediately kill your liver and would immediately kill your liver and would immediately kill your liver and you know you just can't have that in you know you just can't have that in you know you just can't have that in your body it has to be deactivated your body it has to be deactivated your body it has to be deactivated immediately which your body does in kind immediately which your body does in kind immediately which your body does in kind of a split second by going through a of a split second by going through a of a split second by going through a very complex cycle it's a complex cycle very complex cycle it's a complex cycle very complex cycle it's a complex cycle but it happens very quickly and it turns but it happens very quickly and it turns but it happens very quickly and it turns it into a far less dangerous substance it into a far less dangerous substance it into a far less dangerous substance it's called UA now again remember this it's called UA now again remember this it's called UA now again remember this all happens in your liver that the all happens in your liver that the all happens in your liver that the amonia turns into the Ura there's amonia turns into the Ura there's amonia turns into the Ura there's actually a a very small percent of actually a a very small percent of actually a a very small percent of babies born it's like and every 30,000 babies born it's like and every 30,000 babies born it's like and every 30,000 babies born that lacks the enzymes to babies born that lacks the enzymes to babies born that lacks the enzymes to make this urious cycle work which means make this urious cycle work which means make this urious cycle work which means the ammonia would basically kill the the ammonia would basically kill the the ammonia would basically kill the baby in a very short space of time if baby in a very short space of time if baby in a very short space of time if this is discovered this is discovered this is discovered early the baby can be saved by putting early the baby can be saved by putting early the baby can be saved by putting on an ultra low calorie diet an ultra on an ultra low calorie diet an ultra on an ultra low calorie diet an ultra low protein diet rather and then the low protein diet rather and then the low protein diet rather and then the baby's fine if it as long as it eats baby's fine if it as long as it eats baby's fine if it as long as it eats this ultra low protein diet it does the this ultra low protein diet it does the this ultra low protein diet it does the fats that actually you know the child fats that actually you know the child fats that actually you know the child has to be very careful and then the has to be very careful and then the has to be very careful and then the adult but it can Sur adult but it can Sur adult but it can Sur survive so that's how important this survive so that's how important this survive so that's how important this cycle is okay now what happens to the cycle is okay now what happens to the cycle is okay now what happens to the Yuri you don't want this building up in Yuri you don't want this building up in Yuri you don't want this building up in your blood either so it circulates your blood either so it circulates your blood either so it circulates through your blood and when it gets to through your blood and when it gets to through your blood and when it gets to your kidneys your kidneys filter it out your kidneys your kidneys filter it out your kidneys your kidneys filter it out and guess what it does with the Uria it and guess what it does with the Uria it and guess what it does with the Uria it goes into your urine that's why urine is goes into your urine that's why urine is goes into your urine that's why urine is called urine it's from Uria okay so then called urine it's from Uria okay so then called urine it's from Uria okay so then it gets excreted well when there's too it gets excreted well when there's too it gets excreted well when there's too much of it and your kidney has to be much of it and your kidney has to be much of it and your kidney has to be working over time to filter all this working over time to filter all this working over time to filter all this excess Uria which it does if you're excess Uria which it does if you're excess Uria which it does if you're eating too much protein then that is eating too much protein then that is eating too much protein then that is very hard on your kidneys and in fact very hard on your kidneys and in fact very hard on your kidneys and in fact people that have kidney disease have to people that have kidney disease have to people that have kidney disease have to eat a very low protein diet as do people eat a very low protein diet as do people eat a very low protein diet as do people who have serious liver disease because who have serious liver disease because who have serious liver disease because processing the Protein that's we is very processing the Protein that's we is very processing the Protein that's we is very hard on those organs but why wait till hard on those organs but why wait till hard on those organs but why wait till you have that problem why wait until you you have that problem why wait until you you have that problem why wait until you have endstage kidney disease before you have endstage kidney disease before you have endstage kidney disease before you cut down to an appropriate amount of cut down to an appropriate amount of cut down to an appropriate amount of protein why don't you do it beforehand protein why don't you do it beforehand protein why don't you do it beforehand so you don't get endstage kidney disease so you don't get endstage kidney disease so you don't get endstage kidney disease so you don't end up in that dialysis so you don't end up in that dialysis so you don't end up in that dialysis clinic in your nearest shopping center clinic in your nearest shopping center clinic in your nearest shopping center okay so that is pretty much the first okay so that is pretty much the first okay so that is pretty much the first danger of eating protein that we've just danger of eating protein that we've just danger of eating protein that we've just gone over is the harm pure liver and gone over is the harm pure liver and gone over is the harm pure liver and kidneys but there's more so let's look kidneys but there's more so let's look kidneys but there's more so let's look at protein danger number two which is at protein danger number two which is at protein danger number two which is the excess protein makes your cancer the excess protein makes your cancer the excess protein makes your cancer grow faster if you have cancer cells in grow faster if you have cancer cells in grow faster if you have cancer cells in your body Pro excess protein is not a your body Pro excess protein is not a your body Pro excess protein is not a good thing it's going to make them good thing it's going to make them good thing it's going to make them Thrive so let's look at why that Thrive so let's look at why that Thrive so let's look at why that is well there's multiple reasons there's is well there's multiple reasons there's is well there's multiple reasons there's not just one mechanism but this is one not just one mechanism but this is one not just one mechanism but this is one of the most important mechanisms of why of the most important mechanisms of why of the most important mechanisms of why protein makes cancer Thrive and that is protein makes cancer Thrive and that is protein makes cancer Thrive and that is production of a hormone called insulin production of a hormone called insulin production of a hormone called insulin like growth factor one or igf1 for short like growth factor one or igf1 for short like growth factor one or igf1 for short now igf-1 is an essential hormone it now igf-1 is an essential hormone it now igf-1 is an essential hormone it regulates a lot of your body metabolism regulates a lot of your body metabolism regulates a lot of your body metabolism your growth at the stage of your uh life your growth at the stage of your uh life your growth at the stage of your uh life cycle when you're still growing in cycle when you're still growing in cycle when you're still growing in childhood and when you're a teenager it childhood and when you're a teenager it childhood and when you're a teenager it regulates cell division cell death and regulates cell division cell death and regulates cell division cell death and all those things things and certain all those things things and certain all those things things and certain proteins in diet will raise igf-1 levels proteins in diet will raise igf-1 levels proteins in diet will raise igf-1 levels and the Protein that's most strongly and the Protein that's most strongly and the Protein that's most strongly implicated in that is actually Dairy implicated in that is actually Dairy implicated in that is actually Dairy protein so dairy foods are the ones that protein so dairy foods are the ones that protein so dairy foods are the ones that will make the igf sore to the highest will make the igf sore to the highest will make the igf sore to the highest level and that makes sense because level and that makes sense because level and that makes sense because there's actually idf1 in dairy products there's actually idf1 in dairy products there's actually idf1 in dairy products because remember it's produced by the because remember it's produced by the because remember it's produced by the mom cow for her calf was a little tiny mom cow for her calf was a little tiny mom cow for her calf was a little tiny thing that she wants to grow up drinking thing that she wants to grow up drinking thing that she wants to grow up drinking her milk so she's going to nurse a calf her milk so she's going to nurse a calf her milk so she's going to nurse a calf to grow but unfortunately you're not a to grow but unfortunately you're not a to grow but unfortunately you're not a little calf so when you consume it little calf so when you consume it little calf so when you consume it you're getting all this growth factor you're getting all this growth factor you're getting all this growth factor but you don't need it and it's extremely dangerous so how does it stimulate dangerous so how does it stimulate cancer cell growth well there's a few cancer cell growth well there's a few cancer cell growth well there's a few ways one is that the growth hormone ways one is that the growth hormone ways one is that the growth hormone itself because it's stimulating cell itself because it's stimulating cell itself because it's stimulating cell division is making the cancer cells division is making the cancer cells division is making the cancer cells divide faster and by the way cancer divide faster and by the way cancer divide faster and by the way cancer cells appear to be more susceptible to cells appear to be more susceptible to cells appear to be more susceptible to the effect idf1 the normal cells are so the effect idf1 the normal cells are so the effect idf1 the normal cells are so they are going to start dividing faster they are going to start dividing faster they are going to start dividing faster than they otherwise would than they otherwise would than they otherwise would have there's another mechanism which is have there's another mechanism which is have there's another mechanism which is that there's something called normal that there's something called normal that there's something called normal cell death and this is actually a normal cell death and this is actually a normal cell death and this is actually a normal programm part of you that if you have a programm part of you that if you have a programm part of you that if you have a diseased or damaged cell or a cell diseased or damaged cell or a cell diseased or damaged cell or a cell that's become nonfunctional it's that's become nonfunctional it's that's become nonfunctional it's supposed to self-destruct that's how supposed to self-destruct that's how supposed to self-destruct that's how your body's programmed it's actually your body's programmed it's actually your body's programmed it's actually very important it does that well cancer very important it does that well cancer very important it does that well cancer cells usually won't self-destruct but if cells usually won't self-destruct but if cells usually won't self-destruct but if there's not too much igf1 they will so there's not too much igf1 they will so there's not too much igf1 they will so this normal self-destructive process is this normal self-destructive process is this normal self-destructive process is basically deactivated by the excess basically deactivated by the excess basically deactivated by the excess igf-1 and then another thing because the igf-1 and then another thing because the igf-1 and then another thing because the igf-1 is fueling growth is it's fueling igf-1 is fueling growth is it's fueling igf-1 is fueling growth is it's fueling the blood vessels that nourish the tumor the blood vessels that nourish the tumor the blood vessels that nourish the tumor if you have a tumor you know tumors grow if you have a tumor you know tumors grow if you have a tumor you know tumors grow when they're nourished by excess blood when they're nourished by excess blood when they're nourished by excess blood vessels and there's a lot of cancer vessels and there's a lot of cancer vessels and there's a lot of cancer drugs now that are coming out that work drugs now that are coming out that work drugs now that are coming out that work by keeping these blood vessels from by keeping these blood vessels from by keeping these blood vessels from growing to you know the tumors so you growing to you know the tumors so you growing to you know the tumors so you can actually have a lot of that same can actually have a lot of that same can actually have a lot of that same effect just by not having the igf1 from effect just by not having the igf1 from effect just by not having the igf1 from all these excess animal Foods now all these excess animal Foods now all these excess animal Foods now there's one more thing I want to mention there's one more thing I want to mention there's one more thing I want to mention about protein and the level of igf1 about protein and the level of igf1 about protein and the level of igf1 we've talked about Dairy protein is the we've talked about Dairy protein is the we've talked about Dairy protein is the worst other animal proteins are very bad worst other animal proteins are very bad worst other animal proteins are very bad too it appears that highly concentrated too it appears that highly concentrated too it appears that highly concentrated plant proteins and here I'm not talking plant proteins and here I'm not talking plant proteins and here I'm not talking about Whole Foods but things like soy about Whole Foods but things like soy about Whole Foods but things like soy protein powders and this has not been protein powders and this has not been protein powders and this has not been studies that extensively as the animal studies that extensively as the animal studies that extensively as the animal foods but they also cause levels of igf1 foods but they also cause levels of igf1 foods but they also cause levels of igf1 to go up because remember the function to go up because remember the function to go up because remember the function of protein is to facilitate growth of protein is to facilitate growth of protein is to facilitate growth that's one of its functions so the the that's one of its functions so the the that's one of its functions so the the plan it's been studying most for is soy plan it's been studying most for is soy plan it's been studying most for is soy the isolated soy protein pows this has the isolated soy protein pows this has the isolated soy protein pows this has nothing to do with whole soy I don't nothing to do with whole soy I don't nothing to do with whole soy I don't want anybody in this room to want anybody in this room to want anybody in this room to misunderstand and say I'm not going to misunderstand and say I'm not going to misunderstand and say I'm not going to eat atam momy I'm not going to eat tofu eat atam momy I'm not going to eat tofu eat atam momy I'm not going to eat tofu I'm not going to eat Tempe or soy yogurt I'm not going to eat Tempe or soy yogurt I'm not going to eat Tempe or soy yogurt it has nothing to do with those those it has nothing to do with those those it has nothing to do with those those are not highly processed foods it has to are not highly processed foods it has to are not highly processed foods it has to do with the kind of protein that's been do with the kind of protein that's been do with the kind of protein that's been extracted from the soybean and basically extracted from the soybean and basically extracted from the soybean and basically get sold as a white powder that you can get sold as a white powder that you can get sold as a white powder that you can buy and just eat to excess or that gets buy and just eat to excess or that gets buy and just eat to excess or that gets used to make zhein gets used to make used to make zhein gets used to make used to make zhein gets used to make imitation meats or something like that imitation meats or something like that imitation meats or something like that so you want to avoid these concentrated so you want to avoid these concentrated so you want to avoid these concentrated protein powders even if they're from protein powders even if they're from protein powders even if they're from plants so remember we saw the nutrition plants so remember we saw the nutrition plants so remember we saw the nutrition aisle you know you you want to be aisle you know you you want to be aisle you know you you want to be healthy you want to kind of just stay healthy you want to kind of just stay healthy you want to kind of just stay off that aisle soy milk is fine someone off that aisle soy milk is fine someone off that aisle soy milk is fine someone asked about soy milk soy milk is fine asked about soy milk soy milk is fine asked about soy milk soy milk is fine that's also not highly processed the that's also not highly processed the that's also not highly processed the point is soy milk things like that are point is soy milk things like that are point is soy milk things like that are not highly processed what I'm talking not highly processed what I'm talking not highly processed what I'm talking about are things it's actually a powder about are things it's actually a powder about are things it's actually a powder that you buy in a jug that's made in a that you buy in a jug that's made in a that you buy in a jug that's made in a factory so let's get on to the third factory so let's get on to the third factory so let's get on to the third mechanism by which too much protein of mechanism by which too much protein of mechanism by which too much protein of the wrong kind can harm you and that is the wrong kind can harm you and that is the wrong kind can harm you and that is the protein can cause the protein can cause the protein can cause inflammation throughout your body so inflammation throughout your body so inflammation throughout your body so let's see why that's let's see why that's let's see why that's important important important well inflammation is a natural process well inflammation is a natural process well inflammation is a natural process it's very protective it's a function it's very protective it's a function it's very protective it's a function mostly of your immune system but also of mostly of your immune system but also of mostly of your immune system but also of your nervous system you have to have your nervous system you have to have your nervous system you have to have inflammation to protect you from things inflammation to protect you from things inflammation to protect you from things like microbes and injury to heal after like microbes and injury to heal after like microbes and injury to heal after say you burn yourself or scrape yourself say you burn yourself or scrape yourself say you burn yourself or scrape yourself or cut yourself or anything like that or cut yourself or anything like that or cut yourself or anything like that you have to have inflammation to help you have to have inflammation to help you have to have inflammation to help you heal and that's all your immune you heal and that's all your immune you heal and that's all your immune system protecting system protecting system protecting you but some proteins cause excess you but some proteins cause excess you but some proteins cause excess inflammation now remember your immune inflammation now remember your immune inflammation now remember your immune system protecting you what's it system protecting you what's it system protecting you what's it protecting you from it's protecting you protecting you from it's protecting you protecting you from it's protecting you from things that could hurt from things that could hurt from things that could hurt you now remember we talked about our you now remember we talked about our you now remember we talked about our chain our protein chain and the ideal is chain our protein chain and the ideal is chain our protein chain and the ideal is that when you digest a protein that when you digest a protein that when you digest a protein chain you break it into all these amino chain you break it into all these amino chain you break it into all these amino acids the amino acids are absorbed and acids the amino acids are absorbed and acids the amino acids are absorbed and they're no longer protein so they're not they're no longer protein so they're not they're no longer protein so they're not going to incite your immune system they going to incite your immune system they going to incite your immune system they will inight your liver and kidneys as we will inight your liver and kidneys as we will inight your liver and kidneys as we talked about they won't incite your talked about they won't incite your talked about they won't incite your immune system but here's the thing immune system but here's the thing immune system but here's the thing often times a large part of this chain often times a large part of this chain often times a large part of this chain does not get broken down in the does not get broken down in the does not get broken down in the digestion process because that process digestion process because that process digestion process because that process is about 99% right on but about 1% of is about 99% right on but about 1% of is about 99% right on but about 1% of the time it's incomplete so when you the time it's incomplete so when you the time it's incomplete so when you think of all the proteins you eat about think of all the proteins you eat about think of all the proteins you eat about 1% of the time a large part of the chain 1% of the time a large part of the chain 1% of the time a large part of the chain is going to be absorbed into your body is going to be absorbed into your body is going to be absorbed into your body intact and that becomes a foreign intact and that becomes a foreign intact and that becomes a foreign protein in your body that your immune protein in your body that your immune protein in your body that your immune system can say I don't like this now system can say I don't like this now system can say I don't like this now this happens many times a day so your this happens many times a day so your this happens many times a day so your immune system can't go crazy on every immune system can't go crazy on every immune system can't go crazy on every kind of protein so what kind of protein kind of protein so what kind of protein kind of protein so what kind of protein is it going to be looking out for well is it going to be looking out for well is it going to be looking out for well it's not usually looking out for plant it's not usually looking out for plant it's not usually looking out for plant proteins because plants aren't going to proteins because plants aren't going to proteins because plants aren't going to hurt you remember plants are kind of hurt you remember plants are kind of hurt you remember plants are kind of self-sufficient they're out there we self-sufficient they're out there we self-sufficient they're out there we talked about they're growing in the sun talked about they're growing in the sun talked about they're growing in the sun they're the base of the food chain they they're the base of the food chain they they're the base of the food chain they make or absorb their own nutrients they make or absorb their own nutrients they make or absorb their own nutrients they really don't need you so plants not really don't need you so plants not really don't need you so plants not going to come you know your rose bush going to come you know your rose bush going to come you know your rose bush isn't going to come and invade your body isn't going to come and invade your body isn't going to come and invade your body and take you over and kill you right and take you over and kill you right and take you over and kill you right what it's looking for is foreign animal what it's looking for is foreign animal what it's looking for is foreign animal proteins because animals are nutrient proteins because animals are nutrient proteins because animals are nutrient consumers and some of them might very consumers and some of them might very consumers and some of them might very well want to consume you and that would well want to consume you and that would well want to consume you and that would be things like parasites or microbes be things like parasites or microbes be things like parasites or microbes that are in the animal kingdom that want that are in the animal kingdom that want that are in the animal kingdom that want to consume you so that's what your to consume you so that's what your to consume you so that's what your immune system is on the lookout for and immune system is on the lookout for and immune system is on the lookout for and what it's going to react to with what it's going to react to with what it's going to react to with inflammation now you might be saying inflammation now you might be saying inflammation now you might be saying well inflammation is actually protective well inflammation is actually protective well inflammation is actually protective you just told me inflammation is you just told me inflammation is you just told me inflammation is protective so why should I care about it protective so why should I care about it protective so why should I care about it and the answer is that yes it is and the answer is that yes it is and the answer is that yes it is protective when it's in the acute stage protective when it's in the acute stage protective when it's in the acute stage which is right after you faced a threat which is right after you faced a threat which is right after you faced a threat or let's say right after you cut or let's say right after you cut or let's say right after you cut yourself or right after you've been yourself or right after you've been yourself or right after you've been attacked by some cold viruses or attacked by some cold viruses or attacked by some cold viruses or parasites or something like that but if parasites or something like that but if parasites or something like that but if it goes on and on and on that is it it goes on and on and on that is it it goes on and on and on that is it becomes chronic that's a different story becomes chronic that's a different story becomes chronic that's a different story then it becomes destructive because it then it becomes destructive because it then it becomes destructive because it never has a chance to never has a chance to never has a chance to heal so remember the inflammation starts heal so remember the inflammation starts heal so remember the inflammation starts out protecting you deactivating the out protecting you deactivating the out protecting you deactivating the Invader very aggressively and then it Invader very aggressively and then it Invader very aggressively and then it helps you to heal helps you to heal helps you to heal well when you have chronic inflammation well when you have chronic inflammation well when you have chronic inflammation you never get into that healing phase you never get into that healing phase you never get into that healing phase because it's as if you had a scrape if because it's as if you had a scrape if because it's as if you had a scrape if you had a scrape after a few days it you had a scrape after a few days it you had a scrape after a few days it would start to heal but if you got a would start to heal but if you got a would start to heal but if you got a scrape and every single day you took scrape and every single day you took scrape and every single day you took some steel wool and you kept scraping some steel wool and you kept scraping some steel wool and you kept scraping and scrape and scraping it and scraping and scrape and scraping it and scraping and scrape and scraping it and scraping and scraping it would never heal right and scraping it would never heal right and scraping it would never heal right because you'd be irritating it every day because you'd be irritating it every day because you'd be irritating it every day and that's the same thing when you're and that's the same thing when you're and that's the same thing when you're eating these foreign proteins that your eating these foreign proteins that your eating these foreign proteins that your body perceives as threats several times body perceives as threats several times body perceives as threats several times a day it causes The Chronic inflam now a day it causes The Chronic inflam now a day it causes The Chronic inflam now again it's not the only thing that again it's not the only thing that again it's not the only thing that causes chronic inflammation it's causes chronic inflammation it's causes chronic inflammation it's something that needs to be really something that needs to be really something that needs to be really studied quite a bit more it's something studied quite a bit more it's something studied quite a bit more it's something that not nearly enough energy has been that not nearly enough energy has been that not nearly enough energy has been devoted to studying because in fact devoted to studying because in fact devoted to studying because in fact chronic inflammation underlies most chronic inflammation underlies most chronic inflammation underlies most chronic disease that includes chronic disease that includes chronic disease that includes hypertension cardiovascular disease hypertension cardiovascular disease hypertension cardiovascular disease autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes you autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes you autoimmune diseases type 2 diabetes you know all the common killers and the know all the common killers and the know all the common killers and the things that make you uncomfortable things that make you uncomfortable things that make you uncomfortable things like sinusitis or headaches that things like sinusitis or headaches that things like sinusitis or headaches that aren't necessarily going to kill you but aren't necessarily going to kill you but aren't necessarily going to kill you but they make your life miserable are all they make your life miserable are all they make your life miserable are all examples of chronic examples of chronic examples of chronic inflammation so you really don't want to inflammation so you really don't want to inflammation so you really don't want to be uh fueling this chronic inflammation be uh fueling this chronic inflammation be uh fueling this chronic inflammation you want to be giving your body a break you want to be giving your body a break you want to be giving your body a break so it can heal and the inflammation can so it can heal and the inflammation can so it can heal and the inflammation can go away so that's another reason you go away so that's another reason you go away so that's another reason you don't want to be consuming these don't want to be consuming these don't want to be consuming these proteins again this is something that proteins again this is something that proteins again this is something that there should be a lot more research on there should be a lot more research on there should be a lot more research on there is quite a few studies out that there is quite a few studies out that there is quite a few studies out that look at you know the effect of animal look at you know the effect of animal look at you know the effect of animal foods and processed foods and whole foods and processed foods and whole foods and processed foods and whole plant Foods on inflammation in the body plant Foods on inflammation in the body plant Foods on inflammation in the body using certain markers of using certain markers of using certain markers of inflammation and what they find is that inflammation and what they find is that inflammation and what they find is that animal foods and extremely highly animal foods and extremely highly animal foods and extremely highly processed plant foods do cause more processed plant foods do cause more processed plant foods do cause more inflammation whereas whole plant foods inflammation whereas whole plant foods inflammation whereas whole plant foods cause you to have a balanc inflammatory cause you to have a balanc inflammatory cause you to have a balanc inflammatory state in other words you're in exactly state in other words you're in exactly state in other words you're in exactly the state you should be you don't want the state you should be you don't want the state you should be you don't want to go from one extreme to the other you to go from one extreme to the other you to go from one extreme to the other you don't want to not jump off one cliff and don't want to not jump off one cliff and don't want to not jump off one cliff and run the other way screaming and fall off run the other way screaming and fall off run the other way screaming and fall off the cliff that's a mile down the road so the cliff that's a mile down the road so the cliff that's a mile down the road so you don't want to go from being you don't want to go from being you don't want to go from being pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory pro-inflammatory to anti-inflammatory you want to be balanced and that's what you want to be balanced and that's what you want to be balanced and that's what Whole Foods help you do so let's look at Whole Foods help you do so let's look at Whole Foods help you do so let's look at what some of these myths are and what what some of these myths are and what what some of these myths are and what you can do to make better choices so the you can do to make better choices so the you can do to make better choices so the first myth is that plants don't have first myth is that plants don't have first myth is that plants don't have enough enough enough protein well we already kind of debunked protein well we already kind of debunked protein well we already kind of debunked this one but I wanted to Circle back to this one but I wanted to Circle back to this one but I wanted to Circle back to it because this one is so important I it because this one is so important I it because this one is so important I think it's very critical to be explicit think it's very critical to be explicit think it's very critical to be explicit with it for you to see that this really with it for you to see that this really with it for you to see that this really is not the case so what did we learn is not the case so what did we learn is not the case so what did we learn about plant protein we learned that about plant protein we learned that about plant protein we learned that plants are the base of the food chain plants are the base of the food chain plants are the base of the food chain and they make all the essential amino and they make all the essential amino and they make all the essential amino acids now these amino acids do get more acids now these amino acids do get more acids now these amino acids do get more concentrated in animal muscle but they concentrated in animal muscle but they concentrated in animal muscle but they get more concentrated than you really get more concentrated than you really get more concentrated than you really need and that can be a source of ill need and that can be a source of ill need and that can be a source of ill health as we just saw the plants have health as we just saw the plants have health as we just saw the plants have plenty of protein why because the plants plenty of protein why because the plants plenty of protein why because the plants need need need protein you know that if you're a protein you know that if you're a protein you know that if you're a gardener if you're a gardener you know gardener if you're a gardener you know gardener if you're a gardener you know your plants need Nitro nitrogen remember your plants need Nitro nitrogen remember your plants need Nitro nitrogen remember we looked at nitrogen as a special we looked at nitrogen as a special we looked at nitrogen as a special element of protein why do you have to element of protein why do you have to element of protein why do you have to give your plants nitrogen fertilizer give your plants nitrogen fertilizer give your plants nitrogen fertilizer it's because the plants are making it's because the plants are making it's because the plants are making protein okay in fact about 30% of the protein okay in fact about 30% of the protein okay in fact about 30% of the dry weight of plant cells is actually dry weight of plant cells is actually dry weight of plant cells is actually protein and it's a living thing of the protein and it's a living thing of the protein and it's a living thing of the plants so this whole idea that plants plants so this whole idea that plants plants so this whole idea that plants don't have enough protein is wrong on don't have enough protein is wrong on don't have enough protein is wrong on any number of any number of any number of counts but there's even another reason counts but there's even another reason counts but there's even another reason why this doesn't make why this doesn't make why this doesn't make sense which is that your body recycles sense which is that your body recycles sense which is that your body recycles amino acids so your body is actually amino acids so your body is actually amino acids so your body is actually very efficient and your body isn't going very efficient and your body isn't going very efficient and your body isn't going to waste anything that it can use or to waste anything that it can use or to waste anything that it can use or reuse so it's kind of like this Fountain reuse so it's kind of like this Fountain reuse so it's kind of like this Fountain this picture is actually a very nice this picture is actually a very nice this picture is actually a very nice fountain in Baba Park in San Diego it's fountain in Baba Park in San Diego it's fountain in Baba Park in San Diego it's one of my favorite one of my favorite one of my favorite fountains and you can see what the fountains and you can see what the fountains and you can see what the fountain is doing the fountain is fountain is doing the fountain is fountain is doing the fountain is spraying water and then what happens to spraying water and then what happens to spraying water and then what happens to the the the water The Fountain reuses the water okay water The Fountain reuses the water okay water The Fountain reuses the water okay so if this Fountain needs 100 gallons of so if this Fountain needs 100 gallons of so if this Fountain needs 100 gallons of water does the city of San Diego need to water does the city of San Diego need to water does the city of San Diego need to put 100 gallons of water in this put 100 gallons of water in this put 100 gallons of water in this Fountain every Fountain every Fountain every day of course not because a fountain is day of course not because a fountain is day of course not because a fountain is just Recycling and Recycling and just Recycling and Recycling and just Recycling and Recycling and recycling the water it needs to put a recycling the water it needs to put a recycling the water it needs to put a tiny bit in eventually because some of tiny bit in eventually because some of tiny bit in eventually because some of the water will evaporate and some might the water will evaporate and some might the water will evaporate and some might Splash out or something like that but Splash out or something like that but Splash out or something like that but basically it just keeps Recycling and basically it just keeps Recycling and basically it just keeps Recycling and recirculating and it's exactly what recirculating and it's exactly what recirculating and it's exactly what happens to your amino acids remember happens to your amino acids remember happens to your amino acids remember they're building they're building they're building blocks they're these little building blocks they're these little building blocks they're these little building blocks blocks blocks so so so you can reuse them again and again and you can reuse them again and again and you can reuse them again and again and again and again and again so that's why again and again and again so that's why again and again and again so that's why you don't need to take in that much you you don't need to take in that much you you don't need to take in that much you know if you weigh 150 lbs you don't need know if you weigh 150 lbs you don't need know if you weigh 150 lbs you don't need to eat 150 lbs of protein every day and to eat 150 lbs of protein every day and to eat 150 lbs of protein every day and actually a lot of that weight is water actually a lot of that weight is water actually a lot of that weight is water and minerals but whatever weight it's and minerals but whatever weight it's and minerals but whatever weight it's protein you don't need to eat that every protein you don't need to eat that every protein you don't need to eat that every day because your body is recycling the day because your body is recycling the day because your body is recycling the aminos and it actually excels best at aminos and it actually excels best at aminos and it actually excels best at conserving the amino acids that are conserving the amino acids that are conserving the amino acids that are least common in Foods so remember we least common in Foods so remember we least common in Foods so remember we talked about we have amino acids storage talked about we have amino acids storage talked about we have amino acids storage pools but they're very small your body pools but they're very small your body pools but they're very small your body will preferentially fill them up with will preferentially fill them up with will preferentially fill them up with the amino acids that are hardest to get the amino acids that are hardest to get the amino acids that are hardest to get from foods and that's one reason you from foods and that's one reason you from foods and that's one reason you don't have to worry about mixing and don't have to worry about mixing and don't have to worry about mixing and matching protein there's that myth that matching protein there's that myth that matching protein there's that myth that you know if you eat plant foods you you know if you eat plant foods you you know if you eat plant foods you should eat beans and rice or that kind should eat beans and rice or that kind should eat beans and rice or that kind of thing because they have complimentary of thing because they have complimentary of thing because they have complimentary you know amino acids that's actually you know amino acids that's actually you know amino acids that's actually totally untrue every plant has all 20 totally untrue every plant has all 20 totally untrue every plant has all 20 amino acids both the essential and the amino acids both the essential and the amino acids both the essential and the non-essential it needs it to live and in non-essential it needs it to live and in non-essential it needs it to live and in fact even if it were true you wouldn't fact even if it were true you wouldn't fact even if it were true you wouldn't have to worry about it because your have to worry about it because your have to worry about it because your body's going to preferentially conserve body's going to preferentially conserve body's going to preferentially conserve the amino acids it has the hardest time the amino acids it has the hardest time the amino acids it has the hardest time getting so let's look at myth number getting so let's look at myth number getting so let's look at myth number two which is the myth that was on the two which is the myth that was on the two which is the myth that was on the USDA plate remember that little graphic USDA plate remember that little graphic USDA plate remember that little graphic I showed you where there was a whole I showed you where there was a whole I showed you where there was a whole quarter of the plate that was devoted to quarter of the plate that was devoted to quarter of the plate that was devoted to protein you're supp of protein on why protein you're supp of protein on why protein you're supp of protein on why know you supposed to put on in a chain know you supposed to put on in a chain know you supposed to put on in a chain like this and eat it I don't know like this and eat it I don't know like this and eat it I don't know they're not very explicit not very much they're not very explicit not very much they're not very explicit not very much help but the point is that plate is help but the point is that plate is help but the point is that plate is extremely misleading because everything extremely misleading because everything extremely misleading because everything on that plate had protein it was made on that plate had protein it was made on that plate had protein it was made from protein we' just been talking about from protein we' just been talking about from protein we' just been talking about that so the vegetables are full of that so the vegetables are full of that so the vegetables are full of protein the fruit actually the food protein the fruit actually the food protein the fruit actually the food that's lowest in protein but still the that's lowest in protein but still the that's lowest in protein but still the live it was a living thing so it has live it was a living thing so it has live it was a living thing so it has protein and the whole grains are very protein and the whole grains are very protein and the whole grains are very high in high in high in protein so you don't need a special protein so you don't need a special protein so you don't need a special source of protein because every single source of protein because every single source of protein because every single solitary thing on the plate has protein solitary thing on the plate has protein solitary thing on the plate has protein in it and yet you're Tau to look at in it and yet you're Tau to look at in it and yet you're Tau to look at protein is kind of like the center of protein is kind of like the center of protein is kind of like the center of the meal it's the most valuable thing the meal it's the most valuable thing the meal it's the most valuable thing it's the thing you Center your whole it's the thing you Center your whole it's the thing you Center your whole meal about is this protein right it's meal about is this protein right it's meal about is this protein right it's just a total just a total just a total myth and the source of protein meth myth and the source of protein meth myth and the source of protein meth causes just absolutely no end of causes just absolutely no end of causes just absolutely no end of Mischief you don't need a special source Mischief you don't need a special source Mischief you don't need a special source of protein in your food any more than of protein in your food any more than of protein in your food any more than you need a special source of oxygen in you need a special source of oxygen in you need a special source of oxygen in your air right you don't need to go to your air right you don't need to go to your air right you don't need to go to one corner the room to get your oxygen one corner the room to get your oxygen one corner the room to get your oxygen because the oxygen is evenly diffused because the oxygen is evenly diffused because the oxygen is evenly diffused throughout the whole room and it's the throughout the whole room and it's the throughout the whole room and it's the same thing with the protein it's same thing with the protein it's same thing with the protein it's diffused throughout everything you eat diffused throughout everything you eat diffused throughout everything you eat therefore you do not need a special therefore you do not need a special therefore you do not need a special source of it okay so there's another source of it okay so there's another source of it okay so there's another very common myth that keeps people just very common myth that keeps people just very common myth that keeps people just glomming down what they see is protein glomming down what they see is protein glomming down what they see is protein protein animal food animal food these protein animal food animal food these protein animal food animal food these days so let's see what that myth is okay days so let's see what that myth is okay days so let's see what that myth is okay so it's a myth that your an ancestors so it's a myth that your an ancestors so it's a myth that your an ancestors ate lots of animal ate lots of animal ate lots of animal protein and therefore you should too protein and therefore you should too protein and therefore you should too because after all you wouldn't want to because after all you wouldn't want to because after all you wouldn't want to do anything different from what your do anything different from what your do anything different from what your ancestors did 2 and a half million years ancestors did 2 and a half million years ancestors did 2 and a half million years ago would ago would ago would you so let's look at this one in a you so let's look at this one in a you so let's look at this one in a little bit more detail this is called little bit more detail this is called little bit more detail this is called the paleo diet the caveman diet it has the paleo diet the caveman diet it has the paleo diet the caveman diet it has some other names so it doesn't really some other names so it doesn't really some other names so it doesn't really matter what it's called basically it's a matter what it's called basically it's a matter what it's called basically it's a diet that tells you to eat lots and lots diet that tells you to eat lots and lots diet that tells you to eat lots and lots and lots of meat not to eat dairy so and lots of meat not to eat dairy so and lots of meat not to eat dairy so you're going to eat meat basically you're going to eat meat basically you're going to eat meat basically fruits and vegetables you're told not to fruits and vegetables you're told not to fruits and vegetables you're told not to eat grain not to eat beans and just to eat grain not to eat beans and just to eat grain not to eat beans and just to eat basically the meats fruits and eat basically the meats fruits and eat basically the meats fruits and vegetables which is supposedly what your vegetables which is supposedly what your vegetables which is supposedly what your ancestors ate 2 and a half million years ancestors ate 2 and a half million years ancestors ate 2 and a half million years ago well that makes it very nice ago well that makes it very nice ago well that makes it very nice appealing story because it sets you up appealing story because it sets you up appealing story because it sets you up to think you can kind of be in to think you can kind of be in to think you can kind of be in communication with your ancestors 2 and communication with your ancestors 2 and communication with your ancestors 2 and a half million years ago just by eating a half million years ago just by eating a half million years ago just by eating the foods they ate but there's a little the foods they ate but there's a little the foods they ate but there's a little problem with this story which is that problem with this story which is that problem with this story which is that it's a total fairy tale and it gets you it's a total fairy tale and it gets you it's a total fairy tale and it gets you eating a dis a disease inducing diet eating a dis a disease inducing diet eating a dis a disease inducing diet that's actually very harmful and I don't that's actually very harmful and I don't that's actually very harmful and I don't have time tonight to go into all the have time tonight to go into all the have time tonight to go into all the aspects of this smth I would be here for aspects of this smth I would be here for aspects of this smth I would be here for over an hour just going over this but over an hour just going over this but over an hour just going over this but let me just hit a few of the highlights let me just hit a few of the highlights let me just hit a few of the highlights so you realize how absolutely ridiculous so you realize how absolutely ridiculous so you realize how absolutely ridiculous this is first off 2 and a half million this is first off 2 and a half million this is first off 2 and a half million years ago your ancestors did not look years ago your ancestors did not look years ago your ancestors did not look anything like what we look like now was anything like what we look like now was anything like what we look like now was a totally different species of hominid a totally different species of hominid a totally different species of hominid than we are now than we are now than we are now so they actually had very thick teeth so they actually had very thick teeth so they actually had very thick teeth and very thick and very thick and very thick jaws and you can actually see this if jaws and you can actually see this if jaws and you can actually see this if you want to look it up on Smithsonian you want to look it up on Smithsonian you want to look it up on Smithsonian website you just can search for they website you just can search for they website you just can search for they have a very nice little family tree of have a very nice little family tree of have a very nice little family tree of how humans evolved and shows you very how humans evolved and shows you very how humans evolved and shows you very nice pictures at each step of the nice pictures at each step of the nice pictures at each step of the way so our ancestors had such thick way so our ancestors had such thick way so our ancestors had such thick teeth and such thick Jaws at that point teeth and such thick Jaws at that point teeth and such thick Jaws at that point that it saw that they actually ate tree that it saw that they actually ate tree that it saw that they actually ate tree bark far from eating meat so here they bark far from eating meat so here they bark far from eating meat so here they are living on the savanas of Africa are living on the savanas of Africa are living on the savanas of Africa where we can see that there's all these where we can see that there's all these where we can see that there's all these large animals and it's hot and there's large animals and it's hot and there's large animals and it's hot and there's not much shade now even the paleo diet not much shade now even the paleo diet not much shade now even the paleo diet proponents say that in fact humans back proponents say that in fact humans back proponents say that in fact humans back then had very primitive tools and they then had very primitive tools and they then had very primitive tools and they would have a very hard time with those would have a very hard time with those would have a very hard time with those extremely primitive tools hunting these extremely primitive tools hunting these extremely primitive tools hunting these animals and killing them so then where animals and killing them so then where animals and killing them so then where were they supposed to get all this were they supposed to get all this were they supposed to get all this meat well the the answer that is given meat well the the answer that is given meat well the the answer that is given by these kind of diets is they got it by by these kind of diets is they got it by by these kind of diets is they got it by eating the kill of large Carnival for eating the kill of large Carnival for eating the kill of large Carnival for it's not too likely that a ban of it's not too likely that a ban of it's not too likely that a ban of cavemen were going to come along and cavemen were going to come along and cavemen were going to come along and steal the meat from the lion I mean steal the meat from the lion I mean steal the meat from the lion I mean there's just even more grounds as could there's just even more grounds as could there's just even more grounds as could be faulted on but when you start be faulted on but when you start be faulted on but when you start thinking about it you realize that this thinking about it you realize that this thinking about it you realize that this is a very appealing diet and the people is a very appealing diet and the people is a very appealing diet and the people pointing it out there are making pointing it out there are making pointing it out there are making millions of dollars off it if not more millions of dollars off it if not more millions of dollars off it if not more but it does nothing for your but it does nothing for your but it does nothing for your health so now we've looked at three of health so now we've looked at three of health so now we've looked at three of the main myths that keep you eating the main myths that keep you eating the main myths that keep you eating protein unnecessarily so let's look into protein unnecessarily so let's look into protein unnecessarily so let's look into well you might be thinking to yourself well you might be thinking to yourself well you might be thinking to yourself well what should I be eating well what should I be eating well what should I be eating instead okay well let's look at that if instead okay well let's look at that if instead okay well let's look at that if you're not going to be eating all this you're not going to be eating all this you're not going to be eating all this animal food what are you going to eat to animal food what are you going to eat to animal food what are you going to eat to get the optimal amount of protein and get the optimal amount of protein and get the optimal amount of protein and the right kind of protein so you don't the right kind of protein so you don't the right kind of protein so you don't you know get this highly dreaded protein you know get this highly dreaded protein you know get this highly dreaded protein deficiency deficiency deficiency diseases so the first thing to do if diseases so the first thing to do if diseases so the first thing to do if you're on a plant-based diet a whole you're on a plant-based diet a whole you're on a plant-based diet a whole food plant-based diet which is what I'm food plant-based diet which is what I'm food plant-based diet which is what I'm going to talk about is don't stress going to talk about is don't stress going to talk about is don't stress about protein and don't dissect your about protein and don't dissect your about protein and don't dissect your food Dr T and Campbell probably most of food Dr T and Campbell probably most of food Dr T and Campbell probably most of you have heard of him he's the author of you have heard of him he's the author of you have heard of him he's the author of The China Study has said your body does The China Study has said your body does The China Study has said your body does the math that's a very important thing the math that's a very important thing the math that's a very important thing to remember your body does the math when to remember your body does the math when to remember your body does the math when you eat a whole food plant-based diet you eat a whole food plant-based diet you eat a whole food plant-based diet you don't have to worry about it you you don't have to worry about it you you don't have to worry about it you don't have to start dissecting it and so don't have to start dissecting it and so don't have to start dissecting it and so that way that's profoundly liberating that way that's profoundly liberating that way that's profoundly liberating because you don't have to go around and because you don't have to go around and because you don't have to go around and try to be counting grams of protein or try to be counting grams of protein or try to be counting grams of protein or you know carb or anything else it's just you know carb or anything else it's just you know carb or anything else it's just going to be going to be going to be automatic and these the reason it shows automatic and these the reason it shows automatic and these the reason it shows little team here is that these Whole little team here is that these Whole little team here is that these Whole Food nutrients are a superstar team and Food nutrients are a superstar team and Food nutrients are a superstar team and they all work together very they all work together very they all work together very synergistically and this is true for synergistically and this is true for synergistically and this is true for everyone again there's another whole everyone again there's another whole everyone again there's another whole series of myth out there that it's true series of myth out there that it's true series of myth out there that it's true for some people but not others because for some people but not others because for some people but not others because of their blood type well you know we of their blood type well you know we of their blood type well you know we just talked about the fact that there's just talked about the fact that there's just talked about the fact that there's over 2 million kinds of protein in your over 2 million kinds of protein in your over 2 million kinds of protein in your body why would one protein out of those body why would one protein out of those body why would one protein out of those over 2 million determine what you should over 2 million determine what you should over 2 million determine what you should eat does that make any sense to you eat does that make any sense to you eat does that make any sense to you hopefully not at this point so there's hopefully not at this point so there's hopefully not at this point so there's no relation to blood type whatsoever no relation to blood type whatsoever no relation to blood type whatsoever it's not a function of genetics within it's not a function of genetics within it's not a function of genetics within each species every individual in that each species every individual in that each species every individual in that species eats pretty much the same thing species eats pretty much the same thing species eats pretty much the same thing so there's no reason to think people so there's no reason to think people so there's no reason to think people would be any different so for example if would be any different so for example if would be any different so for example if you think about rabbits just to take a you think about rabbits just to take a you think about rabbits just to take a totally random example some rabbits you totally random example some rabbits you totally random example some rabbits you wouldn't say some rabbits eat grass and wouldn't say some rabbits eat grass and wouldn't say some rabbits eat grass and other rabbits eat fish right the rabbits other rabbits eat fish right the rabbits other rabbits eat fish right the rabbits they're going to eat plants and it's the they're going to eat plants and it's the they're going to eat plants and it's the same thing with humans we all clearly same thing with humans we all clearly same thing with humans we all clearly genetically different just like all the genetically different just like all the genetically different just like all the rabbits are genetically different but it rabbits are genetically different but it rabbits are genetically different but it doesn't mean we're eating different doesn't mean we're eating different doesn't mean we're eating different foods because we're eating the food that foods because we're eating the food that foods because we're eating the food that our species is designed for so the whole our species is designed for so the whole our species is designed for so the whole plant foods are going to keep you on plant foods are going to keep you on plant foods are going to keep you on target they're going to get you the target they're going to get you the target they're going to get you the right amount of protein and the right right amount of protein and the right right amount of protein and the right kind of protein which is we just talked kind of protein which is we just talked kind of protein which is we just talked about you want to be at the center of about you want to be at the center of about you want to be at the center of the bullseye and the animal food diet is the bullseye and the animal food diet is the bullseye and the animal food diet is keeping you way above the center of the keeping you way above the center of the keeping you way above the center of the bullseye you're not even on the target bullseye you're not even on the target bullseye you're not even on the target anymore so how does that happen What anymore so how does that happen What anymore so how does that happen What Whole Food plant-based diet should you Whole Food plant-based diet should you Whole Food plant-based diet should you eat well there's no one answer I you eat well there's no one answer I you eat well there's no one answer I you guys have a lot of speakers here and guys have a lot of speakers here and guys have a lot of speakers here and you're going to hear different you're going to hear different you're going to hear different information and it's all good information and it's all good information and it's all good information and there's a lot of kinds information and there's a lot of kinds information and there's a lot of kinds of Whole Food plant-based diets you can of Whole Food plant-based diets you can of Whole Food plant-based diets you can eat and be healthy I'm going to suggest eat and be healthy I'm going to suggest eat and be healthy I'm going to suggest one that I call the perfect formula diet one that I call the perfect formula diet one that I call the perfect formula diet that works very well I don't want you to that works very well I don't want you to that works very well I don't want you to think it's the only one but this one is think it's the only one but this one is think it's the only one but this one is very simple to follow and it's going to very simple to follow and it's going to very simple to follow and it's going to get you the right amount of calories get you the right amount of calories get you the right amount of calories nutrients and protein and there's four nutrients and protein and there's four nutrients and protein and there's four pillars of this diet so a quarter's pillars of this diet so a quarter's pillars of this diet so a quarter's vegetables a quar is fruit a quarter is vegetables a quar is fruit a quarter is vegetables a quar is fruit a quarter is potatoes and legumes and a quarter is potatoes and legumes and a quarter is potatoes and legumes and a quarter is whole grains legumes by the way are like whole grains legumes by the way are like whole grains legumes by the way are like beans and peas and you can think of a beans and peas and you can think of a beans and peas and you can think of a quarter as being like the plate because quarter as being like the plate because quarter as being like the plate because it's like volume so if you look at a it's like volume so if you look at a it's like volume so if you look at a plate but not the USDA plate a different plate but not the USDA plate a different plate but not the USDA plate a different plate and you cut it into plate and you cut it into plate and you cut it into quarters you're going to eat a quarter quarters you're going to eat a quarter quarters you're going to eat a quarter of each of these kind of foods and you of each of these kind of foods and you of each of these kind of foods and you don't have to be really rigorous about don't have to be really rigorous about don't have to be really rigorous about it you don't have to eat them in any it you don't have to eat them in any it you don't have to eat them in any special order you don't have to worry if special order you don't have to worry if special order you don't have to worry if you eat three baked potatoes in a row you eat three baked potatoes in a row you eat three baked potatoes in a row the point is you just want to eat the point is you just want to eat the point is you just want to eat generous amounts of all these kind of generous amounts of all these kind of generous amounts of all these kind of foods you want to eat when you're foods you want to eat when you're foods you want to eat when you're hungry moderately hungry you don't want hungry moderately hungry you don't want hungry moderately hungry you don't want to wait till you're famished you want to to wait till you're famished you want to to wait till you're famished you want to eat slowly and enjoy your food and stop eat slowly and enjoy your food and stop eat slowly and enjoy your food and stop eating when you're eating when you're eating when you're full and that's pretty much all there is full and that's pretty much all there is full and that's pretty much all there is to it now there are more Whole Foods for to it now there are more Whole Foods for to it now there are more Whole Foods for Health you can add first off herbs and Health you can add first off herbs and Health you can add first off herbs and spices which I always like to think of spices which I always like to think of spices which I always like to think of as another kind of whole food because as another kind of whole food because as another kind of whole food because they make your food more interesting they make your food more interesting they make your food more interesting flavorful they have a lot of very flavorful they have a lot of very flavorful they have a lot of very beneficial phytonutrients in them they beneficial phytonutrients in them they beneficial phytonutrients in them they keep keep your food interesting they keep keep your food interesting they keep keep your food interesting they keep you from adding so much salt to keep you from adding so much salt to keep you from adding so much salt to your food because you can enjoy the your food because you can enjoy the your food because you can enjoy the spices instead of just pouring on salt spices instead of just pouring on salt spices instead of just pouring on salt so you want to do that and then in terms so you want to do that and then in terms so you want to do that and then in terms of nuts people ask about nuts a lot you of nuts people ask about nuts a lot you of nuts people ask about nuts a lot you want to just eat small amounts so you want to just eat small amounts so you want to just eat small amounts so you know you might eat a handful or two a know you might eat a handful or two a know you might eat a handful or two a day you don't have to eat nuts but if day you don't have to eat nuts but if day you don't have to eat nuts but if you enjoy nuts or nut Butters and you you enjoy nuts or nut Butters and you you enjoy nuts or nut Butters and you want to make a peanut butter sandwich or want to make a peanut butter sandwich or want to make a peanut butter sandwich or some kind of nut sauce or something like some kind of nut sauce or something like some kind of nut sauce or something like that it's fine to eat the nuts to these that it's fine to eat the nuts to these that it's fine to eat the nuts to these six Whole Food categories there's not six Whole Food categories there's not six Whole Food categories there's not much you have to worry about we're not much you have to worry about we're not much you have to worry about we're not going to talk about Omega-3s tonight but going to talk about Omega-3s tonight but going to talk about Omega-3s tonight but to the extent that you're worrying about to the extent that you're worrying about to the extent that you're worrying about Omega-3s and you know you need to Omega-3s and you know you need to Omega-3s and you know you need to balance your Omega-3s and Omega sixes balance your Omega-3s and Omega sixes balance your Omega-3s and Omega sixes you want to eat ground flax seed for you want to eat ground flax seed for you want to eat ground flax seed for that and again another easy way to do that and again another easy way to do that and again another easy way to do that is just don't need oils remember that is just don't need oils remember that is just don't need oils remember plant oils are a processed food I showed plant oils are a processed food I showed plant oils are a processed food I showed you that picture of plant oils sitting you that picture of plant oils sitting you that picture of plant oils sitting in jars in the supermarket shelves in jars in the supermarket shelves in jars in the supermarket shelves that's highly processed food that is not that's highly processed food that is not that's highly processed food that is not a whole a whole a whole food so when we're thinking of grain food so when we're thinking of grain food so when we're thinking of grain whole grains are Whole Foods things like whole grains are Whole Foods things like whole grains are Whole Foods things like white bread and white rice are not Whole white bread and white rice are not Whole white bread and white rice are not Whole Food fats things like nuts and avocados Food fats things like nuts and avocados Food fats things like nuts and avocados and olves or Whole Foods the oils the and olves or Whole Foods the oils the and olves or Whole Foods the oils the separated oils that come in a jar or in separated oils that come in a jar or in separated oils that come in a jar or in a tub or not Whole Foods so you want to a tub or not Whole Foods so you want to a tub or not Whole Foods so you want to stay away from things that are highly stay away from things that are highly stay away from things that are highly processed even if they're plants and processed even if they're plants and processed even if they're plants and that's the essence of the whole food that's the essence of the whole food that's the essence of the whole food plant-based diet now there's two plant-based diet now there's two plant-based diet now there's two essential nutrients you need that don't essential nutrients you need that don't essential nutrients you need that don't really come from food and they're not really come from food and they're not really come from food and they're not part of the the plant food chain so you part of the the plant food chain so you part of the the plant food chain so you want to have to worry about them want to have to worry about them want to have to worry about them separately so when is vitamin B12 so the separately so when is vitamin B12 so the separately so when is vitamin B12 so the vitamins you need the only vitamin that vitamins you need the only vitamin that vitamins you need the only vitamin that is not made by plants is B12 which are is not made by plants is B12 which are is not made by plants is B12 which are actually made by bacteria so bacteria actually made by bacteria so bacteria actually made by bacteria so bacteria make your make your make your B12 so you don't want to eat B12 so you don't want to eat B12 so you don't want to eat contaminated food that's very highly Lac contaminated food that's very highly Lac contaminated food that's very highly Lac with bacteria or drink contaminated with bacteria or drink contaminated with bacteria or drink contaminated water that's full of bacteria and we all water that's full of bacteria and we all water that's full of bacteria and we all sterilize everything these days which sterilize everything these days which sterilize everything these days which remember our ancestors on savanas of remember our ancestors on savanas of remember our ancestors on savanas of Africa did not sterilize food so they Africa did not sterilize food so they Africa did not sterilize food so they were getting lots of B12 but we eat were getting lots of B12 but we eat were getting lots of B12 but we eat sterilized food so where are you going sterilized food so where are you going sterilized food so where are you going to get your B12 well the simplest thing to get your B12 well the simplest thing to get your B12 well the simplest thing is just take a supplement and it's is just take a supplement and it's is just take a supplement and it's really the only supplement I would really the only supplement I would really the only supplement I would recommend is the B12 because it's very recommend is the B12 because it's very recommend is the B12 because it's very inexpensive you're not going to be inexpensive you're not going to be inexpensive you're not going to be harmed by taking it you know now you're harmed by taking it you know now you're harmed by taking it you know now you're not really going to take too much just not really going to take too much just not really going to take too much just get a bottle and take it and don't worry get a bottle and take it and don't worry get a bottle and take it and don't worry is it in my nutritional yeast is it in is it in my nutritional yeast is it in is it in my nutritional yeast is it in my breakfast cereal and then vitamin D my breakfast cereal and then vitamin D my breakfast cereal and then vitamin D is something you actually make here in is something you actually make here in is something you actually make here in Hawaii by having this sun on your skin Hawaii by having this sun on your skin Hawaii by having this sun on your skin if you're unfortunate enough to live if you're unfortunate enough to live if you're unfortunate enough to live somewhere where there's not much sun you somewhere where there's not much sun you somewhere where there's not much sun you might actually have to end up taking a d might actually have to end up taking a d might actually have to end up taking a d supplement but we very much prefer not supplement but we very much prefer not supplement but we very much prefer not to do that for you to get enough Sun to do that for you to get enough Sun to do that for you to get enough Sun that you can make your own vitamin D that you can make your own vitamin D that you can make your own vitamin D which is NOT saying excess of sun but which is NOT saying excess of sun but which is NOT saying excess of sun but enough to make your own vitamin D and enough to make your own vitamin D and enough to make your own vitamin D and that's kind of a complicated subject in that's kind of a complicated subject in that's kind of a complicated subject in its own right but to boil it down for its own right but to boil it down for its own right but to boil it down for most people that's about 15 to 20 most people that's about 15 to 20 most people that's about 15 to 20 minutes a day it can vary based on a lot minutes a day it can vary based on a lot minutes a day it can vary based on a lot of factors but if you can get that much of factors but if you can get that much of factors but if you can get that much sun on most days you're going to be okay sun on most days you're going to be okay sun on most days you're going to be okay for most people again you can be tested for most people again you can be tested for most people again you can be tested for it but those are really the only two for it but those are really the only two for it but those are really the only two nutrients you have to worry about on a nutrients you have to worry about on a nutrients you have to worry about on a whole food plant-based diet in terms of whole food plant-based diet in terms of whole food plant-based diet in terms of breaking it out and consuming them breaking it out and consuming them breaking it out and consuming them separately you don't have to worry about separately you don't have to worry about separately you don't have to worry about the protein the vitamins and minerals or the protein the vitamins and minerals or the protein the vitamins and minerals or anything like that you're going to get anything like that you're going to get anything like that you're going to get the right the right the right amount so actually it's very simple I amount so actually it's very simple I amount so actually it's very simple I hope you're sitting there going gee this hope you're sitting there going gee this hope you're sitting there going gee this is a lot simpler than I thought it was is a lot simpler than I thought it was is a lot simpler than I thought it was going to be this is easy to do and I've going to be this is easy to do and I've going to be this is easy to do and I've learned some things I've Lear when I eat learned some things I've Lear when I eat learned some things I've Lear when I eat too much protein it's turned into too much protein it's turned into too much protein it's turned into glucose and fat and that's not what I glucose and fat and that's not what I glucose and fat and that's not what I want and I'm spending $30 a jar on this want and I'm spending $30 a jar on this want and I'm spending $30 a jar on this protein pattern it's doing nothing but protein pattern it's doing nothing but protein pattern it's doing nothing but destroying my liver and kidneys and destroying my liver and kidneys and destroying my liver and kidneys and causing inflammation and making any causing inflammation and making any causing inflammation and making any cancer cells grow so I don't really need cancer cells grow so I don't really need cancer cells grow so I don't really need this I'm just going to eat whole plant this I'm just going to eat whole plant this I'm just going to eat whole plant foods and get what I foods and get what I foods and get what I need so if you look at this slide this need so if you look at this slide this need so if you look at this slide this lady's going to show us how easy it is lady's going to show us how easy it is lady's going to show us how easy it is it's really that easy it's really the it's really that easy it's really the it's really that easy it's really the foods you put in your cart just buy foods you put in your cart just buy foods you put in your cart just buy bunch of Whole Foods enjoy them cook bunch of Whole Foods enjoy them cook bunch of Whole Foods enjoy them cook them up make them into soups and salads them up make them into soups and salads them up make them into soups and salads and rice and pasta dishes and sandwiches and rice and pasta dishes and sandwiches and rice and pasta dishes and sandwiches and burritos and healthy desserts and and burritos and healthy desserts and and burritos and healthy desserts and smoothies and all kinds of great things smoothies and all kinds of great things smoothies and all kinds of great things and and enjoy your and and enjoy your and and enjoy your food [Applause] [Applause] thanks okay the question was what about thanks okay the question was what about thanks okay the question was what about extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil extra virgin olive oil and coconut oil and other kinds of oil that have been and other kinds of oil that have been and other kinds of oil that have been tatted as like Health Miracles and we tatted as like Health Miracles and we tatted as like Health Miracles and we need to eat them they're actually highly need to eat them they're actually highly need to eat them they're actually highly processed foods you don't need them processed foods you don't need them processed foods you don't need them they're actually they're actually they're actually inflammatory and they're very very inflammatory and they're very very inflammatory and they're very very highly concentrated sources of highly concentrated sources of highly concentrated sources of calories so you really don't want to calories so you really don't want to calories so you really don't want to have those so I would stay away from any have those so I would stay away from any have those so I would stay away from any processed food but especially oil you processed food but especially oil you processed food but especially oil you know you've all heard sugar is bad so know you've all heard sugar is bad so know you've all heard sugar is bad so the thing to remember is sugar is bad the thing to remember is sugar is bad the thing to remember is sugar is bad but oil is worse but oil is worse but oil is worse because it's has over twice the calories because it's has over twice the calories because it's has over twice the calories per Spoonful not neither one of them has per Spoonful not neither one of them has per Spoonful not neither one of them has any nutrients that you need the sugar any nutrients that you need the sugar any nutrients that you need the sugar doesn't have nutrients and the oil doesn't have nutrients and the oil doesn't have nutrients and the oil doesn't have nutrients but the oil has doesn't have nutrients but the oil has doesn't have nutrients but the oil has over twice as many empty calories so no over twice as many empty calories so no over twice as many empty calories so no reason to eat reason to eat reason to eat it okay I I believe the question if I it okay I I believe the question if I it okay I I believe the question if I heard you right was what are the signs heard you right was what are the signs heard you right was what are the signs of ammonia of ammonia of ammonia poisoning you you would be dead so poisoning you you would be dead so poisoning you you would be dead so that's a sign if you were poisoned with that's a sign if you were poisoned with that's a sign if you were poisoned with pneumonia you're dead and that's what pneumonia you're dead and that's what pneumonia you're dead and that's what happens to those infants who are born happens to those infants who are born happens to those infants who are born unable to turn amonia into Uria unless unable to turn amonia into Uria unless unable to turn amonia into Uria unless you're put on an ultra low protein you're put on an ultra low protein you're put on an ultra low protein diet all right I think the question was diet all right I think the question was diet all right I think the question was about gluten intolerance correct okay about gluten intolerance correct okay about gluten intolerance correct okay gluten is a wheat protein it's also in gluten is a wheat protein it's also in gluten is a wheat protein it's also in some other kinds of whole grain but some other kinds of whole grain but some other kinds of whole grain but people think of it mostly in connection people think of it mostly in connection people think of it mostly in connection with wheat and it's just a kind of with wheat and it's just a kind of with wheat and it's just a kind of protein in the wheat there are people protein in the wheat there are people protein in the wheat there are people with the disease called celiac disease with the disease called celiac disease with the disease called celiac disease that cannot process this particular that cannot process this particular that cannot process this particular protein and it can be a huge issue for protein and it can be a huge issue for protein and it can be a huge issue for them and cause extremely serious health them and cause extremely serious health them and cause extremely serious health problems that's thought to be about one problems that's thought to be about one problems that's thought to be about one out of every 133 people no the the out of every 133 people no the the out of every 133 people no the the question was does gluten cause question was does gluten cause question was does gluten cause inflammation everyone no animal protein inflammation everyone no animal protein inflammation everyone no animal protein causes inflammation with far greater causes inflammation with far greater causes inflammation with far greater frequency than gluten which is just a frequency than gluten which is just a frequency than gluten which is just a plant protein the people that have been plant protein the people that have been plant protein the people that have been shown to be the longest lived people on shown to be the longest lived people on shown to be the longest lived people on the planet are actually people who are the planet are actually people who are the planet are actually people who are on a traditional diet in okanawa which on a traditional diet in okanawa which on a traditional diet in okanawa which is actually a tropical area where it's a is actually a tropical area where it's a is actually a tropical area where it's a beautiful tropical island where you know beautiful tropical island where you know beautiful tropical island where you know plants grow in abundance just like they plants grow in abundance just like they plants grow in abundance just like they grow in abundance on Hawaii and this has grow in abundance on Hawaii and this has grow in abundance on Hawaii and this has been scientifically proven and been scientifically proven and been scientifically proven and documented that elenowen in fact and documented that elenowen in fact and documented that elenowen in fact and again I'm not talking about them today again I'm not talking about them today again I'm not talking about them today because now they're eaing McDonald's and because now they're eaing McDonald's and because now they're eaing McDonald's and all kinds of stuff but the ones that ate all kinds of stuff but the ones that ate all kinds of stuff but the ones that ate the traditional diet had the highest the traditional diet had the highest the traditional diet had the highest concentration of people who live to be concentration of people who live to be concentration of people who live to be over hundred of any culture on the over hundred of any culture on the over hundred of any culture on the entire entire entire planet so what did those people eat planet so what did those people eat planet so what did those people eat these are the healthy Long Live these are the healthy Long Live these are the healthy Long Live people well there's been some research people well there's been some research people well there's been some research done about what they ate and in fact done about what they ate and in fact done about what they ate and in fact there's a lot of information in the there's a lot of information in the there's a lot of information in the archives about what they ate these archives about what they ate these archives about what they ate these people got approximately 9% of their people got approximately 9% of their people got approximately 9% of their calories from protein about 6% from fat calories from protein about 6% from fat calories from protein about 6% from fat about 85% from about 85% from about 85% from carbohydrates and a full 69% of their carbohydrates and a full 69% of their carbohydrates and a full 69% of their calories came from one food anybody want calories came from one food anybody want

our quick fire round of questions from our quick fire round of questions from our listeners and just to remind you listeners and just to remind you listeners and just to remind you Christopher you know the rules are are Christopher you know the rules are are Christopher you know the rules are are quite simple you can say yes you can say quite simple you can say yes you can say quite simple you can say yes you can say no or if you have to you're allowed a no or if you have to you're allowed a no or if you have to you're allowed a one sentence answer one sentence answer one sentence answer but no more than that and we know that but no more than that and we know that but no more than that and we know that this is the hardest thing for any this is the hardest thing for any this is the hardest thing for any Professor to do but are you willing to Professor to do but are you willing to Professor to do but are you willing to give it a go yes give it a go yes give it a go yes all right you've got the hang of it all right you've got the hang of it all right you've got the hang of it already yes already yes already yes okay Christopher will I die if I don't okay Christopher will I die if I don't okay Christopher will I die if I don't get any protein in my food yes get any protein in my food yes get any protein in my food yes do animals contain special proteins that do animals contain special proteins that do animals contain special proteins that you can't get from Plants now should we you can't get from Plants now should we you can't get from Plants now should we all be worrying about getting enough all be worrying about getting enough all be worrying about getting enough protein no protein no protein no are protein shakes and protein bars are protein shakes and protein bars are protein shakes and protein bars healthy for most people healthy for most people healthy for most people compared to a tablespoon of sugar compared to a tablespoon of sugar compared to a tablespoon of sugar healthier but I always think compared to healthier but I always think compared to healthier but I always think compared to what compared to food what compared to food what compared to food no no no I told you it was hard for a professor I told you it was hard for a professor I told you it was hard for a professor to answer these questions to answer these questions to answer these questions and the last question can eating more and the last question can eating more and the last question can eating more protein help with weight loss no okay I think a lot of people are no okay I think a lot of people are already going to be surprised and I hope already going to be surprised and I hope already going to be surprised and I hope we're now going to unpack this uh in the we're now going to unpack this uh in the we're now going to unpack this uh in the rest of the podcast maybe we can just rest of the podcast maybe we can just rest of the podcast maybe we can just start at the very beginning so I think start at the very beginning so I think start at the very beginning so I think most of our listeners will feel they most of our listeners will feel they most of our listeners will feel they know what a fat is right they're know what a fat is right they're know what a fat is right they're thinking of like an oil they cook with thinking of like an oil they cook with thinking of like an oil they cook with or butter or you know maybe the fat in a or butter or you know maybe the fat in a or butter or you know maybe the fat in a piece of meat and I think almost piece of meat and I think almost piece of meat and I think almost everybody feels sort of confident about everybody feels sort of confident about everybody feels sort of confident about a carb right it's like it's bread or a carb right it's like it's bread or a carb right it's like it's bread or potatoes or something like that I think potatoes or something like that I think potatoes or something like that I think however if a lot of people are like me however if a lot of people are like me however if a lot of people are like me they're actually quite unclear really they're actually quite unclear really they're actually quite unclear really what protein is except you know they're what protein is except you know they're what protein is except you know they're sure there's quite a lot of it and a sure there's quite a lot of it and a sure there's quite a lot of it and a piece of meat because you know their mum piece of meat because you know their mum piece of meat because you know their mum always said you know eat your meat and always said you know eat your meat and always said you know eat your meat and get your protein so could you just sort get your protein so could you just sort get your protein so could you just sort of start at the beginning what is of start at the beginning what is of start at the beginning what is protein and why do we need it protein and why do we need it protein and why do we need it sure so when it comes to fat and carb sure so when it comes to fat and carb sure so when it comes to fat and carb that's really most of our fuel that's really most of our fuel that's really most of our fuel when it comes to protein it's more of when it comes to protein it's more of when it comes to protein it's more of our structure our structure our structure so all of our cells and our organs and so all of our cells and our organs and so all of our cells and our organs and our hair and our fingernails all of that our hair and our fingernails all of that our hair and our fingernails all of that is structural protein is structural protein is structural protein all the enzymes that are in our body all the enzymes that are in our body all the enzymes that are in our body that catalyze reactions and make that catalyze reactions and make that catalyze reactions and make metabolism move forward those are all metabolism move forward those are all metabolism move forward those are all proteins many hormones proteins many hormones proteins many hormones our proteins there's actually a huge our proteins there's actually a huge our proteins there's actually a huge list of functional things list of functional things list of functional things that proteins do that proteins do that proteins do and to take it to one next level maybe and to take it to one next level maybe and to take it to one next level maybe this is helpful maybe this is not all this is helpful maybe this is not all this is helpful maybe this is not all proteins are made of 20 amino acids in proteins are made of 20 amino acids in proteins are made of 20 amino acids in the human body and I like to think of the human body and I like to think of the human body and I like to think of them like Scrabble letters in the them like Scrabble letters in the them like Scrabble letters in the Scrabble board game or the letter Scrabble board game or the letter Scrabble board game or the letter somebody would put on the Marquee of a somebody would put on the Marquee of a somebody would put on the Marquee of a movie theater and for perspective movie theater and for perspective movie theater and for perspective there's a couple of them that are only there's a couple of them that are only there's a couple of them that are only three amino acids tied together which three amino acids tied together which three amino acids tied together which would be called a tripeptide but that would be called a tripeptide but that would be called a tripeptide but that would be unusual would be unusual would be unusual the largest one I know of is something the largest one I know of is something the largest one I know of is something called maybe Tin Tin 35 called maybe Tin Tin 35 called maybe Tin Tin 35 000 amino acids strung together 000 amino acids strung together 000 amino acids strung together I was thinking about this like words and I was thinking about this like words and I was thinking about this like words and these amino acids like letters but these amino acids like letters but these amino acids like letters but you're saying these words can get really you're saying these words can get really you're saying these words can get really long and you need a lot of them but long and you need a lot of them but long and you need a lot of them but fundamentally you can make any word like fundamentally you can make any word like fundamentally you can make any word like any protein out of just this limited any protein out of just this limited any protein out of just this limited number of these uh these amino acids one number of these uh these amino acids one number of these uh these amino acids one could be a limerick you know and one could be a limerick you know and one could be a limerick you know and one could be a haiku it's just amazing how could be a haiku it's just amazing how could be a haiku it's just amazing how they differ in length and what's they differ in length and what's they differ in length and what's critical is not only that the specific critical is not only that the specific critical is not only that the specific amino acids one after another be perfect amino acids one after another be perfect amino acids one after another be perfect like if you were spell checking your like if you were spell checking your like if you were spell checking your your writing in a document and say nope your writing in a document and say nope your writing in a document and say nope that word doesn't work so it has to be that word doesn't work so it has to be that word doesn't work so it has to be perfect and then when the amino acids perfect and then when the amino acids perfect and then when the amino acids are arranged in a certain configuration are arranged in a certain configuration are arranged in a certain configuration these long strings of amino acids uh these long strings of amino acids uh these long strings of amino acids uh twirl and twist and conform they twirl and twist and conform they twirl and twist and conform they actually have to be side by side in just actually have to be side by side in just actually have to be side by side in just the right way and if you change that and the right way and if you change that and the right way and if you change that and unravel them which happens in your unravel them which happens in your unravel them which happens in your stomach with a low ph stomach with a low ph stomach with a low ph it happens with heat it happens with heat it happens with heat you inactivate the protein and if it was you inactivate the protein and if it was you inactivate the protein and if it was going to have some functional purpose going to have some functional purpose going to have some functional purpose like an enzyme or a hormone like an enzyme or a hormone like an enzyme or a hormone it no longer works and now it's kind of it no longer works and now it's kind of it no longer works and now it's kind of just like fuel now you can just break just like fuel now you can just break just like fuel now you can just break apart the single amino acids and use apart the single amino acids and use apart the single amino acids and use them but it can't function like it was them but it can't function like it was them but it can't function like it was going to and that's why protein's so going to and that's why protein's so going to and that's why protein's so tricky so many things that it does so tricky so many things that it does so tricky so many things that it does so many ways to activate and inactivate it many ways to activate and inactivate it many ways to activate and inactivate it and so Christopher to make sure that and so Christopher to make sure that and so Christopher to make sure that I've got this because that was a little I've got this because that was a little I've got this because that was a little scary what you just described you're scary what you just described you're scary what you just described you're basically saying you know we basically saying you know we basically saying you know we eat food with proteins in it we break it eat food with proteins in it we break it eat food with proteins in it we break it down there are like 20 of the potential down there are like 20 of the potential down there are like 20 of the potential like building blocks like letters which like building blocks like letters which like building blocks like letters which is what you're calling these amino acids is what you're calling these amino acids is what you're calling these amino acids and then our body makes almost and then our body makes almost and then our body makes almost everything we're made of out of those everything we're made of out of those everything we're made of out of those like 20 letters in unimaginably complex like 20 letters in unimaginably complex like 20 letters in unimaginably complex sort of combinations sort of combinations sort of combinations I like the way you said that and let me I like the way you said that and let me I like the way you said that and let me add one twist to this which is pretty add one twist to this which is pretty add one twist to this which is pretty interesting there's very few rare interesting there's very few rare interesting there's very few rare exceptions to this but when you say eat exceptions to this but when you say eat exceptions to this but when you say eat an animal protein or a plant protein and an animal protein or a plant protein and an animal protein or a plant protein and it goes into your digestive tract you it goes into your digestive tract you it goes into your digestive tract you can't absorb those amino acids into your can't absorb those amino acids into your can't absorb those amino acids into your body until you break them down to their body until you break them down to their body until you break them down to their single amino acid levels and then you single amino acid levels and then you single amino acid levels and then you absorb them travels through your body absorb them travels through your body absorb them travels through your body reassembles them can't remember where it reassembles them can't remember where it reassembles them can't remember where it came from oh did this come from a cow oh came from oh did this come

like ah come from broccoli no clue it's like ah come from broccoli no clue it's like ah it's just this amino acid I don't even it's just this amino acid I don't even it's just this amino acid I don't even care it came from a supplement care it came from a supplement care it came from a supplement can't even tell it's just the building can't even tell it's just the building can't even tell it's just the building block block block got it so this is like I uh I ate got it so this is like I uh I ate got it so this is like I uh I ate Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my body just breaks it down to letters that body just breaks it down to letters that body just breaks it down to letters that just makes the protein sound even more just makes the protein sound even more just makes the protein sound even more important important important um I guess um I guess um I guess follow-on natural question about this is follow-on natural question about this is follow-on natural question about this is I think one of the things that we've I think one of the things that we've I think one of the things that we've learned on this podcast is that our body learned on this podcast is that our body learned on this podcast is that our body has this amazing ability often to swap has this amazing ability often to swap has this amazing ability often to swap carbs into fat so it doesn't really carbs into fat so it doesn't really carbs into fat so it doesn't really matter what you eat always because your matter what you eat always because your matter what you eat always because your body will make what you need can't we body will make what you need can't we body will make what you need can't we just make these letters these amino just make these letters these amino just make these letters these amino acids when we need them yeah I bet you a acids when we need them yeah I bet you a acids when we need them yeah I bet you a lot of people listening have heard of lot of people listening have heard of lot of people listening have heard of essential and non-essential amino acids essential and non-essential amino acids essential and non-essential amino acids I think it's a pretty non-essential I think it's a pretty non-essential I think it's a pretty non-essential question for all of your listeners but question for all of your listeners but question for all of your listeners but I'm going to say it anyway the I the I'm going to say it anyway the I the I'm going to say it anyway the I the ideas ideas ideas um while carbohydrates and fats are um while carbohydrates and fats are um while carbohydrates and fats are circulating in your body those the basic circulating in your body those the basic circulating in your body those the basic structure of those is is built on structure of those is is built on structure of those is is built on carbons of different lengths and they carbons of different lengths and they carbons of different lengths and they have very complex metabolic pathways and have very complex metabolic pathways and have very complex metabolic pathways and at certain points in carbohydrate at certain points in carbohydrate at certain points in carbohydrate metabolism and fat metabolism you can metabolism and fat metabolism you can metabolism and fat metabolism you can borrow one of these molecules put a borrow one of these molecules put a borrow one of these molecules put a nitrogen on it in the form of an amino nitrogen on it in the form of an amino nitrogen on it in the form of an amino group which means a nitrogen with three group which means a nitrogen with three group which means a nitrogen with three hydrogens hydrogens hydrogens an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen portion you can actually make 11 of the portion you can actually make 11 of the portion you can actually make 11 of the amino acids amino acids amino acids by borrowing something from fat and carb by borrowing something from fat and carb by borrowing something from fat and carb and putting this ammonia amine group on and putting this ammonia amine group on and putting this ammonia amine group on it and likewise if you were breaking it and likewise if you were breaking it and likewise if you were breaking protein down because you had enough for protein down because you had enough for protein down because you had enough for the day which I hope we get to later the day which I hope we get to later the day which I hope we get to later because most people eat more than enough because most people eat more than enough because most people eat more than enough if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen group off you can put it right back into group off you can put it right back into group off you can put it right back into the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing chain and that works for 11 amino acids chain and that works for 11 amino acids chain and that works for 11 amino acids for nine of them there isn't a specific for nine of them there isn't a specific for nine of them there isn't a specific place you can borrow it from in your place you can borrow it from in your place you can borrow it from in your body and so you since you need all 20 body and so you since you need all 20 body and so you since you need all 20 for just about every single protein that for just about every single protein that for just about every single protein that you synthesize you also have to get the you synthesize you also have to get the you synthesize you also have to get the nine essential ones and essential simply nine essential ones and essential simply nine essential ones and essential simply means you can't assemble the whole thing means you can't assemble the whole thing means you can't assemble the whole thing yourself you got to make sure I got that yourself you got to make sure I got that yourself you got to make sure I got that Christopher because it got a bit scary Christopher because it got a bit scary Christopher because it got a bit scary in chemistry again in chemistry again in chemistry again um you're saying there are these 20 um you're saying there are these 20 um you're saying there are these 20 actually we can make some of them actually we can make some of them actually we can make some of them ourselves but actually like I think you ourselves but actually like I think you ourselves but actually like I think you would say nine of them we can't make would say nine of them we can't make would say nine of them we can't make them so you've got to eat them you have them so you've got to eat them you have them so you've got to eat them you have to get those nine in order to do you to get those nine in order to do you to get those nine in order to do you know essential things inside yourself is know essential things inside yourself is know essential things inside yourself is that that that all right so protein is really important all right so protein is really important all right so protein is really important we need to get some we need to get some we need to get some um um um let's talk about how much we therefore let's talk about how much we therefore let's talk about how much we therefore need which was the number one question need which was the number one question need which was the number one question that we had as we were preparing for that we had as we were preparing for that we had as we were preparing for this show this show this show okay uh you're gonna just have to stop okay uh you're gonna just have to stop okay uh you're gonna just have to stop me all over the place and get me to me all over the place and get me to me all over the place and get me to explain it in English because this will explain it in English because this will explain it in English because this will be harder but uh basically you I'm going be harder but uh basically you I'm going be harder but uh basically you I'm going to take one big step back and say if to take one big step back and say if to take one big step back and say if you've eaten enough calories for the day you've eaten enough calories for the day you've eaten enough calories for the day you've got enough protein you've got enough protein you've got enough protein just so stop just so stop just so stop obsessing about protein proteins and obsessing about protein proteins and obsessing about protein proteins and everything all 20 amino acids are in all everything all 20 amino acids are in all everything all 20 amino acids are in all plant Foods big myth to bust here plant Foods big myth to bust here plant Foods big myth to bust here and all animal Foods so if you're simply and all animal Foods so if you're simply and all animal Foods so if you're simply getting enough calories with a getting enough calories with a getting enough calories with a reasonable Variety in your diet like if reasonable Variety in your diet like if reasonable Variety in your diet like if you only ate rice all day you only ate rice all day you only ate rice all day you wouldn't get enough if you only ate you wouldn't get enough if you only ate you wouldn't get enough if you only ate cassava all day cassava all day cassava all day you wouldn't get enough protein but you you wouldn't get enough protein but you you wouldn't get enough protein but you also wouldn't get a lot also wouldn't get a lot also wouldn't get a lot you also wouldn't get enough of other you also wouldn't get enough of other you also wouldn't get enough of other nutrients so let me tell you how people nutrients so let me tell you how people nutrients so let me tell you how people figured out how to get enough protein figured out how to get enough protein figured out how to get enough protein this is disgusting are you ready this is disgusting are you ready this is disgusting are you ready so I got yeah we're ready so I got yeah we're ready so I got yeah we're ready I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in California California California and they were one of the sites that did and they were one of the sites that did and they were one of the sites that did some of the initial trials in the 50s some of the initial trials in the 50s some of the initial trials in the 50s 60s to establish this and the fifth 60s to establish this and the fifth 60s to establish this and the fifth floor of my building Morgan Hall in floor of my building Morgan Hall in floor of my building Morgan Hall in Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we got human subjects that were got human subjects that were got human subjects that were conscientious objectives to the Vietnam conscientious objectives to the Vietnam conscientious objectives to the Vietnam War War War and they volunteered to live up there in and they volunteered to live up there in and they volunteered to live up there in blue zoot suits and the scientists would blue zoot suits and the scientists would blue zoot suits and the scientists would sequentially lower their proteins sequentially lower their proteins sequentially lower their proteins successfully successively down to zero successfully successively down to zero successfully successively down to zero and give them just carbs and fats and and give them just carbs and fats and and give them just carbs and fats and then they would raise the protein back then they would raise the protein back then they would raise the protein back up slowly in their diet and every single up slowly in their diet and every single up slowly in their diet and every single day day day they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would vacuum it for all the hair they would vacuum it for all the hair they would vacuum it for all the hair and skin cells that sloughed off during and skin cells that sloughed off during and skin cells that sloughed off during the day they would collect all the poop the day they would collect all the poop the day they would collect all the poop all the pee all the nose blowings all the pee all the nose blowings all the pee all the nose blowings anything that left the human body anything that left the human body anything that left the human body was collected now we already talked was collected now we already talked was collected now we already talked about this nitrogen thing in protein and about this nitrogen thing in protein and about this nitrogen thing in protein and the initial studies were interestingly the initial studies were interestingly the initial studies were interestingly called called called nitrogen balance studies and instead of nitrogen balance studies and instead of nitrogen balance studies and instead of like analyzing amino acids in poop like analyzing amino acids in poop like analyzing amino acids in poop analyzing amino acids in P analyzing analyzing amino acids in P analyzing analyzing amino acids in P analyzing amino acids in hair you just burn it all amino acids in hair you just burn it all amino acids in hair you just burn it all up and analyze the nitrogen up and analyze the nitrogen up and analyze the nitrogen that's how much protein you can that's how much protein you can that's how much protein you can calculate how much protein left your calculate how much protein left your calculate how much protein left your body and then because they were body and then because they were body and then because they were nutrition scientists they were nutrition scientists they were nutrition scientists they were calculating the amount of protein or calculating the amount of protein or calculating the amount of protein or nitrogen going into the body from food nitrogen going into the body from food nitrogen going into the body from food so they knew how much is going in and so they knew how much is going in and so they knew how much is going in and how much is going out how much is going out how much is going out they raised and lowered it for each they raised and lowered it for each they raised and lowered it for each individual individual individual until they were in Balance but Jonathan until they were in Balance but Jonathan until they were in Balance but Jonathan when they did this for a bunch of people when they did this for a bunch of people when they did this for a bunch of people as you might imagine what they found out as you might imagine what they found out as you might imagine what they found out is oh my God this person in the room is oh my God this person in the room is oh my God this person in the room needed more than that person in the room needed more than that person in the room needed more than that person in the room and when they combined their data with a and when they combined their data with a and when they combined their data with a bunch of other folks who had done the bunch of other folks who had done the bunch of other folks who had done the same disgusting thing they came up with same disgusting thing they came up with same disgusting thing they came up with in math get ready for this a normal in math get ready for this a normal in math get ready for this a normal distribution curve which means ah a distribution curve which means ah a distribution curve which means ah a couple people needed very little a couple people needed very little a couple people needed very little a couple people needed a lot there's a couple people needed a lot there's a couple people needed a lot there's a bell curve so there was an average in bell curve so there was an average in bell curve so there was an average in the middle they did arrive at what would the middle they did arrive at what would the middle they did arrive at what would be the average be the average be the average okay and it's called the ear it's very okay and it's called the ear it's very okay and it's called the ear it's very specific in this huge nutrition book the specific in this huge nutrition book the specific in this huge nutrition book the estimated average requirement now here's estimated average requirement now here's estimated average requirement now here's an important question for you to think an important question for you to think an important question for you to think about when you want to come up with about when you want to come up with about when you want to come up with protein recommendations for the country protein recommendations for the country protein recommendations for the country what would you suggest recommending what would you suggest recommending what would you suggest recommending would you recommend would you recommend would you recommend the estimated average requirement the estimated average requirement the estimated average requirement because if everyone in the country got because if everyone in the country got because if everyone in the country got exactly the estimated average exactly the estimated average exactly the estimated average requirement requirement requirement by definition how many people would be by definition how many people would be by definition how many people would be deficient deficient deficient half half half because it's the average amount because it's the average amount because it's the average amount if you only get the average amount that if you only get the average amount that if you only get the average amount that half of you that are above average not half of you that are above average not half of you that are above average not just intelligently but from protein just intelligently but from protein just intelligently but from protein requirement requirement requirement would be deficient and so this happens would be deficient and so this happens would be deficient and so this happens in protein and all the vitamins and in protein and all the vitamins and in protein and all the vitamins and minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes up with recommended daily allowances for up with recommended daily allowances for up with recommended daily allowances for protein vitamins and minerals protein vitamins and minerals protein vitamins and minerals the standard approach is to take two the standard approach is to take two the standard approach is to take two standard deviations above the average standard deviations above the average standard deviations above the average and in mathematical terms that means and in mathematical terms that means and in mathematical terms that means you've picked a number you've picked a number you've picked a number that should be adequate for 97 and a that should be adequate for 97 and a that should be adequate for 97 and a half percent of the population and there half percent of the population and there half percent of the population and there might be a couple people in the tail might be a couple people in the tail might be a couple people in the tail that need even higher than that but it that need even higher than that but it that need even higher than that but it would be so few that you're pretty safe would be so few that you're pretty safe would be so few that you're pretty safe recommending that amount now not only is recommending that amount now not only is recommending that amount now not only is that mount that mount that mount adequate adequate adequate but another math thing to keep in mind but another math thing to keep in mind but another math thing to keep in mind here is if really everybody in the U.S here is if really everybody in the U.S here is if really everybody in the U.S or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 and a half percent and a half percent and a half percent two standard deviations higher how many two standard deviations higher how many two standard deviations higher how many would be exceeding their requirement would be exceeding their requirement would be exceeding their requirement oh actually like 97 percent oh actually like 97 percent oh actually like 97 percent so just just to make sure I'm with you so just just to make sure I'm with you so just just to make sure I'm with you here Christopher because you know this here Christopher because you know this here Christopher because you know this is uh you're moving at some some pace is uh you're moving at some some pace is uh you're moving at some some pace you're basically saying that when they you're basically saying that when they you're basically saying that when they came up with a recommended amount for came up with a recommended amount for came up with a recommended amount for protein they basically picked then the protein they basically picked then the protein they basically picked then the amount they make sure that almost nobody amount they make sure that almost nobody amount they make sure that almost nobody would have too little and as a result would have too little and as a result would have too little and as a result you know this recommended daily amount you know this recommended daily amount you know this recommended daily amount which I've definitely heard from which I've definitely heard from which I've definitely heard from vitamins right and supplements you hear vitamins right and supplements you hear vitamins right and supplements you hear that very often but I think anytime you that very often but I think anytime you that very often but I think anytime you look on the back of a food label again look on the back of a food label again look on the back of a food label again you know I've definitely seen that for you know I've definitely seen that for you know I've definitely seen that for almost everything almost everything almost everything it's actually the amount that means it's actually the amount that means it's actually the amount that means almost everybody needs less than that almost everybody needs less than that almost everybody needs less than that yes and so if you're getting the yes and so if you're getting the yes and so if you're getting the recommended daily amount you don't need recommended daily amount you don't need recommended daily amount you don't need to worry that you're not getting enough to worry that you're not getting enough to worry that you're not getting enough actually in a sense you might you're actually in a sense you might you're actually in a sense you might you're getting more than you need for almost getting more than you need for almost getting more than you need for almost everybody is so where does this take us everybody is so where does this take us everybody is so where does this take us okay and so what that takes us to is okay and so what that takes us to is okay and so what that takes us to is they came up with a number that said 0.8 they came up with a number that said 0.8 they came up with a number that said 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body grams of protein per kilogram of body grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should meet that and so I have a weight should meet that and so I have a weight should meet that and so I have a graph and a table that I can't show you graph and a table that I can't show you graph and a table that I can't show you because we have a podcast here but for a because we have a podcast here but for a because we have a podcast here but for a lot of people that RDA level would be lot of people that RDA level would be lot of people that RDA level would be maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of protein if if you're heavier uh so I protein if if you're heavier uh so I protein if if you're heavier uh so I have some U.S data that shows how much have some U.S data that shows how much have some U.S data that shows how much protein people eat in the U.S and it's protein people eat in the U.S and it's protein people eat in the U.S and it's pretty much double the ear or double the pretty much double the ear or double the pretty much double the ear or double the RDA RDA RDA just eating food not even trying and so just eating food not even trying and so just eating food not even trying and so to me it's sort of this American idea of to me it's sort of this American idea of to me it's sort of this American idea of god let's see that's what the RDA is but god let's see that's what the RDA is but god let's see that's what the RDA is but I know I'm above average so let me make I know I'm above average so let me make I know I'm above average so let me make sure I get some extra here it's like no sure I get some extra here it's like no sure I get some extra here it's like no you don't understand the concept it was you don't understand the concept it was you don't understand the concept it was built in to recognize that some people built in to recognize that some people built in to recognize that some people would need more would need more would need more and as a nutritionist when I teach and as a nutritionist when I teach and as a nutritionist when I teach students I have to say this is not an students I have to say this is not an students I have to say this is not an individual approach you should not look individual approach you should not look individual approach you should not look at the RDA to see if you are meeting at the RDA to see if you are meeting at the RDA to see if you are meeting your individual requirement this is a your individual requirement this is a your individual requirement this is a population health approach so that if population health approach so that if population health approach so that if everybody were to get that amount almost everybody were to get that amount almost everybody were to get that amount almost no one no one no one would be deficient and just as you were would be deficient and just as you were would be deficient and just as you were a bit surprised every time I tell that a bit surprised every time I tell that a bit surprised every time I tell that story the audience I explain it to story the audience I explain it to story the audience I explain it to is a little surprise is a little surprise is a little surprise and so Christopher you know I am and so Christopher you know I am and so Christopher you know I am surprised because I've had this surprised because I've had this surprised because I've had this experience and I suspect there's quite a experience and I suspect there's quite a experience and I suspect there's quite a lot of people who've had this experience lot of people who've had this experience lot of people who've had this experience so like the first time I ever went to uh so like the first time I ever went to uh so like the first time I ever went to uh a gym which is about 10 years ago and a gym which is about 10 years ago and a gym which is about 10 years ago and um I had a trainer say you know this is um I had a trainer say you know this is um I had a trainer say you know this is what you need to do in order to get what you need to do in order to get what you need to do in order to get healthier which is what I was interested healthier which is what I was interested healthier which is what I was interested in and fitter well the first thing you in and fitter well the first thing you in and fitter well the first thing you said is oh well you need to eat more said is oh well you need to eat more said is oh well you need to eat more protein and you need to eat at least a protein and you need to eat at least a protein and you need to eat at least a gram per kilogram of gram per kilogram of gram per kilogram of um of protein if you're going to get you um of protein if you're going to get you um of protein if you're going to get you know any benefits out of the work that know any benefits out of the work that know any benefits out of the work that you're going to do at the gym now that you're going to do at the gym now that you're going to do at the gym now that number because I think you just said it number because I think you just said it number because I think you just said it was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your recommended amount which is like the recommended amount which is like the recommended amount which is like the maximum that anyone in the world maximum that anyone in the world maximum that anyone in the world basically needs basically needs basically needs um um um how did this happen why is there there how did this happen why is there there how did this happen why is there there this controversy help me to understand this controversy help me to understand this controversy help me to understand why there's this pressure about why there's this pressure about why there's this pressure about feeling people need to eat more protein feeling people need to eat more protein feeling people need to eat more protein sure okay so let's think about that word sure okay so let's think about that word sure okay so let's think about that word so there is there are some flaws with so there is there are some flaws with so there is there are some flaws with this nitrogen balance study that I this nitrogen balance study that I this nitrogen balance study that I suggested and so what happens in at suggested and so what happens in at suggested and so what happens in at least the US from all the databases I least the US from all the databases I least the US from all the databases I have is have is have is this is this is very consistent in all this is this is very consistent in all this is this is very consistent in all research studies that I look at research studies that I look at research studies that I look at most people get about 16 17 18 of their most people get about 16 17 18 of their most people get about 16 17 18 of their calories from protein it's so consistent calories from protein it's so consistent calories from protein it's so consistent it's just amazing it's just amazing it's just amazing and then you look at how many calories and then you look at how many calories and then you look at how many calories you eat to maintain your weight and you eat to maintain your weight and you eat to maintain your weight and let's not go down this rabbit hole but let's not go down this rabbit hole but let's not go down this rabbit hole but most people underestimate how many most people underestimate how many most people underestimate how many calories they eat the data I have says calories they eat the data I have says calories they eat the data I have says women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men eat three thousand and I know a lot of eat three thousand and I know a lot of eat three thousand and I know a lot of your listeners are going to say not me I your listeners are going to say not me I your listeners are going to say not me I only eat 1500 calories a day we've done only eat 1500 calories a day we've done only eat 1500 calories a day we've done feeding studies where we gave people a feeding studies where we gave people a feeding studies where we gave people a certain amount of calories certain amount of calories certain amount of calories and it's really two thousand twenty five and it's really two thousand twenty five and it's really two thousand twenty five hundred or three thousand if you take 16 hundred or three thousand if you take 16 hundred or three thousand if you take 16 17 18 percent 17 18 percent 17 18 percent of those numbers of those numbers of those numbers people tend to get about 1.5 grams of people tend to get about 1.5 grams of people tend to get about 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram body weight without protein per kilogram body weight without protein per kilogram body weight without trying trying trying they're they're pretty much getting they're they're pretty much getting they're they're pretty much getting double the RDA so now here's what double the RDA so now here's what double the RDA so now here's what happens if you're in the gym getting happens if you're in the gym getting happens if you're in the gym getting that double the RDA right okay so it's that double the RDA right okay so it's that double the RDA right okay so it's probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met your need for enzymes hormones your need for enzymes hormones your need for enzymes hormones fingernails and hair fingernails and hair fingernails and hair you went to the gym to lift weights and you went to the gym to lift weights and you went to the gym to lift weights and gain muscle so you probably want more gain muscle so you probably want more gain muscle so you probably want more than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day so you can put muscle on so you can put muscle on so you can put muscle on okay so let me tell you let me tell you okay so let me tell you let me tell you okay so let me tell you let me tell you how many extra grams of protein you need how many extra grams of protein you need how many extra grams of protein you need so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure muscle in one year would that be pretty muscle in one year would that be pretty muscle in one year would that be pretty good that that I have to say it sounds good that that I have to say it sounds good that that I have to say it sounds quite ambitious I think if anybody saw quite ambitious I think if anybody saw quite ambitious I think if anybody saw me they would say totally ridiculous and me they would say totally ridiculous and me they would say totally ridiculous and impossible but let's go with ambitious impossible but let's go with ambitious impossible but let's go with ambitious shall we shall we shall we okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually 70 of your muscle is water 70 of your muscle is water 70 of your muscle is water so if you were going to do that in a so if you were going to do that in a so if you were going to do that in a year all you'd actually have to year all you'd actually have to year all you'd actually have to accumulate is three kilos of extra amino accumulate is three kilos of extra amino accumulate is three kilos of extra amino acids or 3 000 grams acids or 3 000 grams acids or 3 000 grams of extra amino acids divide that into of extra amino acids divide that into of extra amino acids divide that into 365 days of the year and just roughly 365 days of the year and just roughly 365 days of the year and just roughly that means you would need an extra 10 that means you would need an extra 10 that means you would need an extra 10 grams of protein a day to keep retain in grams of protein a day to keep retain in grams of protein a day to keep retain in addition to meeting your maintenance addition to meeting your maintenance addition to meeting your maintenance needs to put this on now it's not quite needs to put this on now it's not quite needs to put this on now it's not quite a fair number because when you're in the a fair number because when you're in the a fair number because when you're in the gym lifting and working out if you're gym lifting and working out if you're gym lifting and working out if you're working out really hard you're actually working out really hard you're actually working out really hard you're actually breaking down some muscle using those breaking down some muscle using those breaking down some muscle using those amino acids and you have to replace them amino acids and you have to replace them amino acids and you have to replace them so put another 10 grams on that say you so put another 10 grams on that say you so put another 10 grams on that say you needed an extra 20 grams a day every day needed an extra 20 grams a day every day needed an extra 20 grams a day every day for a year for a year for a year to put this on in the U.S people are to put this on in the U.S people are to put this on in the U.S people are eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every day just eating food and one more tidbit day just eating food and one more tidbit day just eating food and one more tidbit I have here is when you're working out I have here is when you're working out I have here is when you're working out hard every day don't you eat more hard every day don't you eat more hard every day don't you eat more you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories I have a Stanford football player who's I have a Stanford football player who's I have a Stanford football player who's in one of the Rose Bowl games in one of the Rose Bowl games in one of the Rose Bowl games he was eating 5 000 calories a day he was eating 5 000 calories a day he was eating 5 000 calories a day because they work him so hard because they work him so hard because they work him so hard he was getting 260 grams of protein he was getting 260 grams of protein he was getting 260 grams of protein every day without trying he wasn't every day without trying he wasn't every day without trying he wasn't having shakes he was just having food having shakes he was just having food having shakes he was just having food so we we should go to like which foods so we we should go to like which foods so we we should go to like which foods have that protein but if we could go have that protein but if we could go have that protein but if we could go here I have one more place to go is well here I have one more place to go is well here I have one more place to go is well wait is that bad what if you actually wait is that bad what if you actually wait is that bad what if you actually got more protein got more protein got more protein then you need it what what would happen then you need it what what would happen then you need it what what would happen to all that extra will it kill you to to all that extra will it kill you to to all that extra will it kill you to have more protein what happens have more protein what happens have more protein what happens okay so but I want to go down a rabbit okay so but I want to go down a rabbit okay so but I want to go down a rabbit hole just for a minute for a fun hole just for a minute for a fun hole just for a minute for a fun exercise so think on an average day you exercise so think on an average day you exercise so think on an average day you probably eat more carbohydrates than you probably eat more carbohydrates than you probably eat more carbohydrates than you need and so once you've eaten some need and so once you've eaten some need and so once you've eaten some carbohydrate the first thing it says oh carbohydrate the first thing it says oh carbohydrate the first thing it says oh my God does my brain need it right now my God does my brain need it right now my God does my brain need it right now nope my brain's okay nope my brain's okay nope my brain's okay um do I does my do I my muscles need it um do I does my do I my muscles need it um do I does my do I my muscles need it now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan I'm just sitting here I don't really I'm just sitting here I don't really I'm just sitting here I don't really need my muscles okay well I have a need my muscles okay well I have a need my muscles okay well I have a storage Depot for my carbohydrate and storage Depot for my carbohydrate and storage Depot for my carbohydrate and it's called glycogen and there's some in it's called glycogen and there's some in it's called glycogen and there's some in my muscles and there's some in my liver my muscles and there's some in my liver my muscles and there's some in my liver so I will try to fill up my storage so I will try to fill up my storage so I will try to fill up my storage capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate so that I can have some later in the day so that I can have some later in the day so that I can have some later in the day and do you know how long it would take and do you know how long it would take and do you know how long it would take you to deplete all the storage you to deplete all the storage you to deplete all the storage carbohydrate in your body any idea do carbohydrate in your body any idea do carbohydrate in your body any idea do you are you a runner Jonathan actually I you are you a runner Jonathan actually I you are you a runner Jonathan actually I don't know this if you're a runner no don't know this if you're a runner no don't know this if you're a runner no I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair doing podcasts but tell me how long does doing podcasts but tell me how long does doing podcasts but tell me how long does it last for it last for it last for so I bet you've heard that marathon so I bet you've heard that marathon so I bet you've heard that marathon runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't have enough carbohydrate that basically have enough carbohydrate that basically have enough carbohydrate that basically means you've used up all the glycogen means you've used up all the glycogen means you've used up all the glycogen that you stored in your body it's only that you stored in your body it's only that you stored in your body it's only about a kilo about a kilo about a kilo okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so let's say you ate more fat calories for let's say you ate more fat calories for let's say you ate more fat calories for the day and you used it for various the day and you used it for various the day and you used it for various things and mostly you burned it for things and mostly you burned it for things and mostly you burned it for energy energy energy where would you store that and how much where would you store that and how much where would you store that and how much could you store and I'll save you the could you store and I'll save you the could you store and I'll save you the trouble here you can store an infinite trouble here you can store an infinite trouble here you can store an infinite capacity of fat oh my gosh you can store capacity of fat oh my gosh you can store capacity of fat oh my gosh you can store hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat in your butt in your pounds of fat in your butt in your pounds of fat in your butt in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your fingers endless capacity to store fat fingers endless capacity to store fat fingers endless capacity to store fat would take you an incredibly long time would take you an incredibly long time would take you an incredibly long time to use up all the storage of fat that to use up all the storage of fat that to use up all the storage of fat that you have in your body so unlimited you have in your body so unlimited you have in your body so unlimited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store carbohydrate where capacity to store carbohydrate where capacity to store carbohydrate where could the extra protein go so your your could the extra protein go so your your could the extra protein go so your your trainer told you to do this trainer told you to do this trainer told you to do this you ate all that extra protein you ate all that extra protein you ate all that extra protein a few major enzymes you made your a few major enzymes you made your a few major enzymes you made your hormones you lifted your weights and it hormones you lifted your weights and it hormones you lifted your weights and it was a little more than you needed or was a little more than you needed or was a little more than you needed or maybe a lot more and you're going to bed maybe a lot more and you're going to bed maybe a lot more and you're going to bed tonight so where do you think you put it tonight so where do you think you put it tonight so where do you think you put it in your body is it in your spleen in in your body is it in your spleen in in your body is it in your spleen in your liver in your big toe in your elbow your liver in your big toe in your elbow your liver in your big toe in your elbow where's your protein storage where's your protein storage where's your protein storage where is my protein storage none every where is my protein storage none every where is my protein storage none every bit of it at the end of the day has the bit of it at the end of the day has the bit of it at the end of the day has the nitrogen taken off and it gets turned nitrogen taken off and it gets turned nitrogen taken off and it gets turned into carbs and fat you can't store into carbs and fat you can't store into carbs and fat you can't store protein in your body so the muscle heads protein in your body so the muscle heads protein in your body so the muscle heads who are having who are having who are having a lot of meat and regular meals and a a lot of meat and regular meals and a a lot of meat and regular meals and a protein shake and a protein bar protein shake and a protein bar protein shake and a protein bar are turning all that into carbs and fats are turning all that into carbs and fats are turning all that into carbs and fats at the end of the day and I'm just going at the end of the day and I'm just going at the end of the day and I'm just going to turn it into basically fat that I lay to turn it into basically fat that I lay to turn it into basically fat that I lay down on my body is that what you're down on my body is that what you're down on my body is that what you're telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be taken off your liver will turn it into taken off your liver will turn it into taken off your liver will turn it into ammonia and your kidney will excrete it ammonia and your kidney will excrete it ammonia and your kidney will excrete it and get it out of your body and so you and get it out of your body and so you and get it out of your body and so you actually could suck out some calcium as actually could suck out some calcium as actually could suck out some calcium as it goes and so some people say don't eat it goes and so some people say don't eat it goes and so some people say don't eat too much protein it'll suck the calcium too much protein it'll suck the calcium too much protein it'll suck the calcium out of your bones let's not go down that out of your bones let's not go down that out of your bones let's not go down that rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen most people with a healthy kidney can most people with a healthy kidney can most people with a healthy kidney can eliminate this just fine you you might eliminate this just fine you you might eliminate this just fine you you might know that if someone has an impaired know that if someone has an impaired know that if someone has an impaired kidney one of the first things they do kidney one of the first things they do kidney one of the first things they do from a dietary perspective is they ask from a dietary perspective is they ask from a dietary perspective is they ask them to limit their protein them to limit their protein them to limit their protein because they don't want their their because they don't want their their because they don't want their their impaired kidney to face the challenge of impaired kidney to face the challenge of impaired kidney to face the challenge of clearing more of this excess ammonia clearing more of this excess ammonia clearing more of this excess ammonia from the excess protein from the excess protein from the excess protein that most people get in a day but to be that most people get in a day but to be that most people get in a day but to be honest most people's bodies are set up honest most people's bodies are set up honest most people's bodies are set up to handle this to handle this to handle this turn it into carbon fat and get rid of turn it into carbon fat and get rid of turn it into carbon fat and get rid of the ammonia for so for most people the ammonia for so for most people the ammonia for so for most people eating that protein eating that protein eating that protein isn't necessarily bad for you unless you isn't necessarily bad for you unless you isn't necessarily bad for you unless you consider consider consider what came with it so if this is what I what came with it so if this is what I what came with it so if this is what I was supposed to say isn't this like a I was supposed to say isn't this like a I was supposed to say isn't this like a I feel like this is a huge scam so feel like this is a huge scam so feel like this is a huge scam so basically there are all these products basically there are all these products basically there are all these products that are on sale that say you know no that are on sale that say you know no that are on sale that say you know no carbs 10 grams of protein or you know carbs 10 grams of protein or you know carbs 10 grams of protein or you know like no sugar 10 grams of protein and like no sugar 10 grams of protein and like no sugar 10 grams of protein and then you're telling me I eat it I then you're telling me I eat it I then you're telling me I eat it I haven't I'm already eating more protein haven't I'm already eating more protein haven't I'm already eating more protein than I need so my body is just going to than I need so my body is just going to than I need so my body is just going to turn that turn that turn that into carbs and fat and since I we know I into carbs and fat and since I we know I into carbs and fat and since I we know I already am eating as much food as I need already am eating as much food as I need already am eating as much food as I need like if I'm having that on top I'm just like if I'm having that on top I'm just like if I'm having that on top I'm just basically going to turn it into body fat basically going to turn it into body fat basically going to turn it into body fat is that have I got that right and so in is that have I got that right and so in is that have I got that right and so in the end it all comes down to calories so the end it all comes down to calories so the end it all comes down to calories so Jonathan we just finished a fun little Jonathan we just finished a

sent me saying the month that someone sent me saying the month that someone sent me saying the same thing and Stu Phillips who's a same thing and Stu Phillips who's a same thing and Stu Phillips who's a fantastic exercise guy from McMaster fantastic exercise guy from McMaster fantastic exercise guy from McMaster University he and I did a podcast University he and I did a podcast University he and I did a podcast together together together and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per kilogram number isn't right it should be kilogram number isn't right it should be kilogram number isn't right it should be higher than that it it may need to be as higher than that it it may need to be as higher than that it it may need to be as high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that what people eat anyway he said well yeah what people eat anyway he said well yeah what people eat anyway he said well yeah that's actually what they get anyway so that's actually what they get anyway so that's actually what they get anyway so if you weren't getting that much it's if you weren't getting that much it's if you weren't getting that much it's possible you could be impaired and you possible you could be impaired and you possible you could be impaired and you would benefit from this but if you were would benefit from this but if you were would benefit from this but if you were tracking your calories right tracking your calories right tracking your

little bit of want however to spend a little bit of want however to spend a little bit of time talking through sort of the the time talking through sort of the the time talking through sort of the the different ages of people because we had different ages of people because we had different ages of people because we had so many questions on social from our so many questions on social from our so many questions on social from our listeners about concerns about protein listeners about concerns about protein listeners about concerns about protein requirements at different ages so I requirements at different ages so I requirements at different ages so I would love to start actually maybe with would love to start actually maybe with would love to start actually maybe with children children children um and I just have this sort of personal um and I just have this sort of personal um and I just have this sort of personal experience right now so I have a 15 year experience right now so I have a 15 year experience right now so I have a 15 year old and his friends have started old and his friends have started old and his friends have started drinking these new energy drinks that drinking these new energy drinks that drinking these new energy drinks that say they have added protein which is a say they have added protein which is a say they have added protein which is a new thing for me that wasn't what I you new thing for me that wasn't what I you new thing for me that wasn't what I you know I wasn't even aware that that was know I wasn't even aware that that was know I wasn't even aware that that was the that that was a a thing they've gone the that that was a a thing they've gone the that that was a a thing they've gone past caffeine is there any evidence that past caffeine is there any evidence that past caffeine is there any evidence that at this point when you're growing really at this point when you're growing really at this point when you're growing really fast that actually kids might not be fast that actually kids might not be fast that actually kids might not be getting enough protein and we need to getting enough protein and we need to getting enough protein and we need to really worry about that really worry about that really worry about that yep so for kids if you go back to all yep so for kids if you go back to all yep so for kids if you go back to all those old RDA calculations those old RDA calculations those old RDA calculations kids need not 0.8 grams but at different kids need not 0.8 grams but at different kids need not 0.8 grams but at different ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 because they're growing because they're growing because they're growing similarly for a pregnant woman that's similarly for a pregnant woman that's similarly for a pregnant woman that's growing a fetus inside of her she's not growing a fetus inside of her she's not growing a fetus inside of her she's not just maintaining she's growing just maintaining she's growing just maintaining she's growing and so those needs are higher than 0.8 and so those needs are higher than 0.8 and so those needs are higher than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day the question grams per kilogram per day the question grams per kilogram per day the question is can you get that just eating food or is can you get that just eating food or is can you get that just eating food or do you need to get these extra sources do you need to get these extra sources do you need to get these extra sources and as as I'm suggesting the food supply and as as I'm suggesting the food supply and as as I'm suggesting the food supply as long as you get a reasonable variety as long as you get a reasonable variety as long as you get a reasonable variety and we should get into plant food versus and we should get into plant food versus and we should get into plant food versus animal food but you would have to work animal food but you would have to work animal food but you would have to work really hard not to get that much protein really hard not to get that much protein really hard not to get that much protein Jonathan I attended the job talk of a Jonathan I attended the job talk of a Jonathan I attended the job talk of a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nutrition person said God you know I'm nutrition person said God you know I'm nutrition person said God you know I'm trying to work with these people with trying to work with these people with trying to work with these people with impaired kidneys and I've been trying to impaired kidneys and I've been trying to impaired kidneys and I've been trying to get them on this really severely get them on this really severely get them on this really severely restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per kilogram body weight and I I can't get kilogram body weight and I I can't get kilogram body weight and I I can't get them there them there them there and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per kilogram it's severely restricted kilogram it's severely restricted kilogram it's severely restricted protein protein protein that's practically the RDA he said yeah that's practically the RDA he said yeah that's practically the RDA he said yeah I can't get them that low I get them to I can't get them that low I get them to I can't get them that low I get them to try to eat this and that and then I try to eat this and that and then I try to eat this and that and then I can't get them that low can't get them that low can't get them that low it's hard not to get it and so does that it's hard not to get it and so does that it's hard not to get it and so does that mean you know as a parent you know you mean you know as a parent you know you mean you know as a parent you know you don't really need to worry about it don't really need to worry about it don't really need to worry about it um but isn't your

you have to make it could be that you have to make it could be that you have to make special effort to make sure in the small special effort to make sure in the small special effort to make sure in the small number of calories that they're getting number of calories that they're getting number of calories that they're getting that they are protein rich that they are protein rich that they are protein rich because they're just not eating very because they're just not eating very because they're just not eating very much much much so Christopher you'd be very patient so Christopher you'd be very patient so Christopher you'd be very patient about not talking about where the about not talking about where the about not talking about where the protein comes from so thank you let's protein comes from so thank you let's protein comes from so thank you let's um do that and we had lots of people um do that and we had lots of people um do that and we had lots of people asking us basically you know sort of asking us basically you know sort of asking us basically you know sort of versions of the same question is animal versions of the same question is animal versions of the same question is animal protein better than plant protein and protein better than plant protein and protein better than plant protein and um you know how are they different you um you know how are they different you um you know how are they different you know and why is it that one might be know and why is it that one might be know and why is it that one might be better than the other better than the other better than the other yeah so you're killing me this is a yeah so you're killing me this is a yeah so you're killing me this is a podcast because I can't tell you how podcast because I can't tell you how podcast because I can't tell you how many hours I spent making slides showing many hours I spent making slides showing many hours I spent making slides showing different amino acids at this point different amino acids at this point different amino acids at this point really have to get down to that amino really have to get down to that amino really have to get down to that amino acid level and so I'm gonna do my best acid level and so I'm gonna do my best acid level and so I'm gonna do my best to describe some of these slides I made to describe some of these slides I made to describe some of these slides I made Jonathan so if you look at the estimated Jonathan so if you look at the estimated Jonathan so if you look at the estimated average requirement of protein for a lot average requirement of protein for a lot average requirement of protein for a lot of people it could be close to 40 grams of people it could be close to 40 grams of people it could be close to 40 grams of protein which is pretty low and I I of protein which is pretty low and I I of protein which is pretty low and I I like to use that number just for fun to like to use that number just for fun to like to use that number just for fun to make this one point there are 20 amino make this one point there are 20 amino make this one point there are 20 amino acids acids acids if you need 40 grams of protein if you need 40 grams of protein if you need 40 grams of protein simplistically that sounds like it would simplistically that sounds like it would simplistically that sounds like it would be good to have two grams of each one 2 be good to have two grams of each one 2 be good to have two grams of each one 2 times 20 is 40. times 20 is 40. times 20 is 40. not even close not even close not even close so you need tons of glutamate glutamine so you need tons of glutamate glutamine so you need tons of glutamate glutamine aspartate asparaging you need hardly any aspartate asparaging you need hardly any aspartate asparaging you need hardly any tryptophan methionine cysteine tryptophan methionine cysteine tryptophan methionine cysteine and the best way I've found to describe and the best way I've found to describe and the best way I've found to describe this is the game of Scrabble this is the game of Scrabble this is the game of Scrabble so Scrabble which my wife beats me at so Scrabble which my wife beats me at so Scrabble which my wife beats me at regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag and I don't know if you know this from and I don't know if you know this from and I don't know if you know this from one country to the other the one country to the other the one country to the other the distribution of letters is a little bit distribution of letters is a little bit distribution of letters is a little bit different depending on how often those different depending on how often those different depending on how often those letters are used in the language of that letters are used in the language of that letters are used in the language of that I'm learning about Scrabble and protein I'm learning about Scrabble and protein I'm learning about Scrabble and protein now Christopher said it's great so think now Christopher said it's great so think now Christopher said it's great so think 26 letters in the alphabet there's a 26 letters in the alphabet there's a 26 letters in the alphabet there's a hundred tiles aren't there four of each hundred tiles aren't there four of each hundred tiles aren't there four of each letter in the Scrabble bag to make your letter in the Scrabble bag to make your letter in the Scrabble bag to make your words no there's only one Z there's one words no there's only one Z there's one words no there's only one Z there's one X One J and there are a whole lot of E's X One J and there are a whole lot of E's X One J and there are a whole lot of E's and A's and n's and ours amino acids are and A's and n's and ours amino acids are and A's and n's and ours amino acids are just like that just like that just like that so what I did is I sort of made a graph so what I did is I sort of made a graph so what I did is I sort of made a graph and I showed ah here's the distribution and I showed ah here's the distribution and I showed ah here's the distribution of 40 grams of protein in eggs in of 40 grams of protein in eggs in of 40 grams of protein in eggs in chicken in pork in fish in beef and chicken in pork in fish in beef and chicken in pork in fish in beef and they're stun the distribution is they're stun the distribution is they're stun the distribution is stunningly stunningly stunningly similar they say wow that's that's similar they say wow that's that's similar they say wow that's that's pretty interesting all the animals have pretty interesting all the animals have pretty interesting all the animals have a lot of the same ones and a few of the a lot of the same ones and a few of the a lot of the same ones and a few of the same ones and then I say okay so you've same ones and then I say okay so you've same ones and then I say okay so you've all heard plants are missing amino acids all heard plants are missing amino acids all heard plants are missing amino acids which ones do you think they're missing which ones do you think they're missing which ones do you think they're missing are different plants missing different are different plants missing different are different plants missing different amino acids and I put up some fake data amino acids and I put up some fake data amino acids and I put up some fake data and I say which one do you think is rice and I say which one do you think is rice and I say which one do you think is rice and beans and broccoli and I I don't let and beans and broccoli and I I don't let and beans and broccoli and I I don't let them think for long and then I put up them think for long and then I put up them think for long and then I put up the actual amino acid distribution and the actual amino acid distribution and the actual amino acid distribution and their jaws drop their jaws drop their jaws drop all of the plants have all 20 amino all of the plants have all 20 amino all of the plants have all 20 amino acids the distribution of the amino acids the distribution of the amino acids the distribution of the amino acids is almost identical in the plants acids is almost identical in the plants acids is almost identical in the plants as the animal and they say what have as the animal and they say what have as the animal and they say what have been people telling me Professor Gardner been people telling me Professor Gardner been people telling me Professor Gardner are you lying did you like make this up are you lying did you like make this up are you lying did you like make this up because this this is not the reality because this this is not the reality because this this is not the reality that I've been told and it's a very that I've been told and it's a very that I've been told and it's a very simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so rice and other grains in general tend to rice and other grains in general tend to rice and other grains in general tend to be low in the proportion of Lysine that be low in the proportion of Lysine that be low in the proportion of Lysine that they have relative to the optimal they have relative to the optimal they have relative to the optimal proportion proportion proportion and likewise beans tend to be low in and likewise beans tend to be low in and likewise beans tend to be low in methionine and cysteine methionine and cysteine methionine and cysteine in proportion in proportion in proportion to what they need and so I like this to what they need and so I like this to what they need and so I like this Scrabble analogy so picture that you've Scrabble analogy so picture that you've Scrabble analogy so picture that you've had the Scrabble game for a really long had the Scrabble game for a really long had the Scrabble game for a really long time and you lost the L for lysine and time and you lost the L for lysine and time and you lost the L for lysine and the M for methionine the M for methionine the M for methionine are you missing all valves and all the are you missing all valves and all the are you missing all valves and all the M's no no actually you only lost a M's no no actually you only lost a M's no no actually you only lost a couple of the letters so if you were couple of the letters so if you were couple of the letters so if you were using your board and trying to make using your board and trying to make using your board and trying to make words you would run out of words you words you would run out of words you words you would run out of words you could make with l and m sooner could make with l and m sooner could make with l and m sooner what if you had a neighbor who also what if you had a neighbor who also what if you had a neighbor who also hadn't played Scrabble in a long time hadn't played Scrabble in a long time hadn't played Scrabble in a long time and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're missing those letters you can have my missing those letters you can have my missing those letters you can have my Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also missing an l and an M I'm sorry you missing an l and an M I'm sorry you missing an l and an M I'm sorry you could still fill up the L and the M that could still fill up the L and the M that could still fill up the L and the M that you were missing because your neighbor you were missing because your neighbor you were missing because your neighbor has extra L's and M's and I think has extra L's and M's and I think has extra L's and M's and I think Americans eat at least 80 grams of Americans eat at least 80 grams of Americans eat at least 80 grams of protein a day not 40 that they need protein a day not 40 that they need protein a day not 40 that they need and so I'm thinking what if you had two and so I'm thinking what if you had two and so I'm thinking what if you had two bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like what Americans eat in protein every day what Americans eat in protein every day what Americans eat in protein every day two bags of Scrabble letters and if two bags of Scrabble letters and if two bags of Scrabble letters and if they're eating plant proteins they are they're eating plant proteins they are they're eating plant proteins they are lower in lysine and methionine lower in lysine and methionine lower in lysine and methionine then would be optimal but that's only a then would be optimal but that's only a then would be optimal but that's only a concern if they only get 40 grams of concern if they only get 40 grams of concern if they only get 40 grams of protein and they need every amino acid protein and they need every amino acid protein and they need every amino acid to count but they get 80 grams of to count but they get 80 grams of to count but they get 80 grams of protein even the vegetarians and the protein even the vegetarians and the protein even the vegetarians and the vegans and Christopher just one vegans and Christopher just one vegans and Christopher just one clarifications I think that it sounds clarifications I think that it sounds clarifications I think that it sounds like a general saying don't worry about like a general saying don't worry about like a general saying don't worry about this are you saying because you're this are you saying because you're this are you saying because you're mentioning two particular amino acids mentioning two particular amino acids mentioning two particular amino acids that I can't pronounce that I can't pronounce that I can't pronounce um um um are you saying that in all plants the are you saying that in all plants the are you saying that in all plants the relative amount of that is lower than it relative amount of that is lower than it relative amount of that is lower than it is in animals is in animals is in animals um so even if you're having a variety of um so even if you're having a variety of um so even if you're having a variety of plants so it's not just that like one plants so it's not just that like one plants so it's not just that like one plant is low in the L and the other one plant is low in the L and the other one plant is low in the L and the other one is low and yeah I'm actually on average is low and yeah I'm actually on average is low and yeah I'm actually on average like all plants are lower in that like all plants are lower in that like all plants are lower in that relative to animals and therefore if you relative to animals and therefore if you relative to animals and therefore if you were eating a plant-only diet then if were eating a plant-only diet then if were eating a plant-only diet then if you were going to eat the 40 grams of you were going to eat the 40 grams of you were going to eat the 40 grams of protein you're going to have potentially protein you're going to have potentially protein you're going to have potentially a low level of those two particular a low level of those two particular a low level of those two particular amino acids I just want to make sure amino acids I just want to make sure amino acids I just want to make sure that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not really it's you need 40. you need 40 in really it's you need 40. you need 40 in really it's you need 40. you need 40 in the right distribution the right distribution the right distribution if you only ate rice all day that's how if you only ate rice all day that's how if you only ate rice all day that's how you got your 40 grams of protein you you got your 40 grams of protein you you got your 40 grams of protein you wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 total grams of protein you run out of total grams of protein you run out of total grams of protein you run out of Lysine too soon if you only ate beans Lysine too soon if you only ate beans Lysine too soon if you only ate beans you'd run out of methionine you'd run out of methionine you'd run out of methionine before you got enough so you could before you got enough so you could before you got enough so you could supplement with just those individual supplement with just those individual supplement with just those individual amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of protein a day protein a day protein a day and you would end up getting the things and you would end up getting the things and you would end up getting the things that you're missing now here's what that you're missing now here's what that you're missing now here's what happens is you really only needed 40 and happens is you really only needed 40 and happens is you really only needed 40 and you 880 you 880 you 880 what do you do with the extra 40 you what do you do with the extra 40 you what do you do with the extra 40 you break 40 down and turn it into break 40 down and turn it into break 40 down and turn it into carbohydrate and fat but that's carbohydrate and fat but that's carbohydrate and fat but that's typically what's happening typically what's happening typically what's happening is that people eat more than the total is that people eat more than the total is that people eat more than the total amount they need amount they need amount they need and so given that plants don't have the and so given that plants don't have the and so given that plants don't have the ideal distribution of the amino acids ideal distribution of the amino acids ideal distribution of the amino acids they're almost always covered they're almost always covered they're almost always covered and you just break down the other ones and you just break down the other ones and you just break down the other ones so there is Jonathan an old concept that so there is Jonathan an old concept that so there is Jonathan an old concept that was written up in Francis Moore Lopez was written up in Francis Moore Lopez was written up in Francis Moore Lopez died for a small planet about died for a small planet about died for a small planet about complementing your proteins because complementing your proteins because complementing your proteins because the grains that are a little low in the grains that are a little low in the grains that are a little low in lysine are a little high in methionine lysine are a little high in methionine lysine are a little high in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine but they're a little high in lysine I'm but they're a little high in lysine I'm but they're a little high in lysine I'm gonna say ah this is sort of a gonna say ah this is sort of a gonna say ah this is sort of a no-brainer that's why some populations no-brainer that's why some populations no-brainer that's why some populations ate grains and beans together ate grains and beans together ate grains and beans together because they complemented the because they complemented the because they complemented the deficiencies with the excesses and it's deficiencies with the excesses and it's deficiencies with the excesses and it's still never quite as good as meat it's still never quite as good as meat it's still never quite as good as meat it's still not the optimal distribution still not the optimal distribution still not the optimal distribution but it's closer to Optimal so you can but it's closer to Optimal so you can but it's closer to Optimal so you can either try to complement them or you either try to complement them or you either try to complement them or you cannot worry about it because you're cannot worry about it because you're cannot worry about it because you're probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't really have to think about it so you can really have to think about it so you can really have to think about it so you can absolutely meet all your needs on a absolutely meet all your needs on a absolutely meet all your needs on a completely plant-based diet stop completely plant-based diet stop completely plant-based diet stop obsessing about protein obsessing about protein obsessing about protein thank you brilliant answer so let's say thank you brilliant answer so let's say thank you brilliant answer so let's say that that that um someone's listening to all of this um someone's listening to all of this um someone's listening to all of this you haven't managed to completely you haven't managed to completely you haven't managed to completely convince them that they shouldn't have convince them that they shouldn't have convince them that they shouldn't have protein because you know it's hard to protein because you know it's hard to protein because you know it's hard to shake that so they're saying okay but shake that so they're saying okay but shake that so they're saying okay but like I'm worried or maybe I do fit into like I'm worried or maybe I do fit into like

yeah yeah yeah wonderful Christopher this has been an wonderful Christopher this has been an wonderful Christopher this has been an amazing tour uh I would love to try and amazing tour uh I would love to try and amazing tour uh I would love to try and do a little summary and then please keep do a little summary and then please keep do a little summary and then please keep me honest if I uh if I got anything me honest if I uh if I got anything me honest if I uh if I got anything wrong is that all right ready wrong is that all right ready wrong is that all right ready absolutely well absolutely well absolutely well um I think first you explained what is um I think first you explained what is um I think first you explained what is protein and what I took away from this protein and what I took away from this protein and what I took away from this is like fat and carbs are like the fuel is like fat and carbs are like the fuel is like fat and carbs are like the fuel that power us through the day but that power us through the day but that power us through the day but protein actually creates the structure protein actually creates the structure protein actually creates the structure so like everything we're made of so like everything we're made of so like everything we're made of basically comes from these these basically comes from these these basically comes from these these proteins and that they come from these proteins and that they come from these proteins and that they come from these 20 amino acids which I'd never 20 amino acids which I'd never 20 amino acids which I'd never understood what that was before but now understood what that was before but now understood what that was before but now I've got in mind they're sort of like I've got in mind they're sort of like I've got in mind they're sort of like the letters in the alphabet and then I'm the letters in the alphabet and then I'm the letters in the alphabet and then I'm like all these words that get created like all these words that get created like all these words that get created out of these these letters out of these these letters out of these these letters um um um in terms of how much protein we need the in terms of how much protein we need the in terms of how much protein we need the answer is far less than any of us answer is far less than any of us answer is far less than any of us realized or have been led to believe uh realized or have been led to believe uh realized or have been led to believe uh your colleagues at Stanford you know a your colleagues at Stanford you know a your colleagues at Stanford you know a long time ago did these crazy studies of long time ago did these crazy studies of long time ago did these crazy studies of of people sort of wrapped up in suits to of people sort of wrapped up in suits to of people sort of wrapped up in suits to understand exactly how much uh they understand exactly how much uh they understand exactly how much uh they needed and it turns out there's a lot of needed and it turns out there's a lot of needed and it turns out there's a lot of variation between people variation between people variation between people um and I'd love to figure out how we um and I'd love to figure out how we um and I'd love to figure out how we might be able to measure that at home might be able to measure that at home might be able to measure that at home somehow in the future but at the moment somehow in the future but at the moment somehow in the future but at the moment we can't Christopher's shaking his head we can't Christopher's shaking his head we can't Christopher's shaking his head there's always some new technology I there's always some new technology I there's always some new technology I feel but maybe that will make it happen feel but maybe that will make it happen feel but maybe that will make it happen but at the moment you can't measure that but at the moment you can't measure that but at the moment you can't measure that for yourself but what they did is they for yourself but what they did is they for yourself but what they did is they figured out sort of what's the maximum figured out sort of what's the maximum figured out sort of what's the maximum that almost anybody needs and that was that almost anybody needs and that was that almost anybody needs and that was actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and on average in the US people are eating on average in the US people are eating on average in the US people are eating double that double that double that um uh already which means that they're um uh already which means that they're um uh already which means that they're eating you know far far more in fact eating you know far far more in fact eating you know far far more in fact than they need so they don't need to than they need so they don't need to than they need so they don't need to worry about it and then we talked about worry about it and then we talked about worry about it and then we talked about well what about if you're not eating well what about if you're not eating well what about if you're not eating lots and lots of animal protein you know lots and lots of animal protein you know lots and lots of animal protein you know is that a problem and the answer was is that a problem and the answer was is that a problem and the answer was really not that actually there are all really not that actually there are all really not that actually there are all the amino acids in Plants there are a the amino acids in Plants there are a the amino acids in Plants there are a couple of these amino acids which have couple of these amino acids which have couple of these amino acids which have lower amounts relatively but since we're lower amounts relatively but since we're lower amounts relatively but since we're all eating so much of it it's not really all eating so much of it it's not really all eating so much of it it's not really a problem and I think the final point a problem and I think the final point a problem and I think the final point was almost anything that says like extra was almost anything that says like extra was almost anything that says like extra high protein on it or you know a bar or high protein on it or you know a bar or high protein on it or you know a bar or a shake or any of these things are just a shake or any of these things are just a shake or any of these things are just really bad for you don't eat them and I really bad for you don't eat them and I really bad for you don't eat them and I think Christopher your messages eat think Christopher your messages eat think Christopher your messages eat beans instead beans instead beans instead yep perfect I don't know why it took me yep perfect I don't know why it took me yep perfect I don't know why it took me an hour to say all that when you just an hour to say all that when you just an hour to say all that when you just said it in three minutes which is pretty said it in three minutes which is pretty said it in three minutes which is pretty good well there one critical mistake so good well there one critical mistake so good well there one critical mistake so those those old studies in the blue those those old studies in the blue those those old studies in the blue suits were Berkeley my alma mater not suits were Berkeley my alma mater not suits were Berkeley my alma mater not Stanford my current place and you know Stanford my current place and you know Stanford my current

much I think Christopher thank you so much I think that was fascinating that was fascinating that was fascinating um and I think there's you know a few of um and I think there's you know a few of um and I think there's you know a few of these points that I'm sure we could go these points that I'm sure we could go these points that I'm sure we could go into in more detail in a in a future into in more detail in a in a future into in more detail in a in a future podcast but I certainly think you will podcast but I certainly think you will podcast but I certainly think you will have hopefully met a lot of people feel have hopefully met a lot of people feel have hopefully met a lot of people feel more relaxed which is great more relaxed which is great more relaxed which is great um and also probably look very um and also probably look very um and also probably look very differently at these foods that say no differently at these foods that say no differently at these foods that say no sugar and 10 grams of protein because sugar and 10 grams of protein because sugar and 10 grams of protein because they now realize if they eat that just they now realize if they eat that just they now realize if they eat that just before they go to bed they might as well before they go to bed they might as well before they go to bed they might as well just have had a chocolate bar it would just

body and what kind of response we have from consuming that response we have from consuming that response we have from consuming that food it's an extraordinary complex field food it's an extraordinary complex field food it's an extraordinary complex field I I cannot emphasize that enough I I cannot emphasize that enough I I cannot emphasize that enough there's so much information and people there's so much information and people there's so much information and people are confused I want to reduce these are confused I want to reduce these are confused I want to reduce these ideas down to the simplest form ideas down to the simplest form ideas down to the simplest form something that people can actually use something that people can actually use something that people can actually use nameless this number one consume plants nameless this number one consume plants nameless this number one consume plants not animals plants of course have talked not animals plants of course have

is the forth that's one thought and that is the forth that's one thought and that is the topic of what commas today also my first topic of what commas today also my first topic of what commas today also my first and second lecture and second lecture and second lecture um there's a second one that's also very um there's a second one that's also very um there's a second one that's also very important and that's consumed food as important and that's consumed food as important and that's consumed food as much as possible in the whole food form much as possible in the whole food form much

just here in these I'm going to focus just here in these I'm going to focus just here in these two two commentaries on the consumption two two commentaries on the consumption two two commentaries on the consumption of plants not animals of plants not animals of plants not animals now as you keep in mind evidently when now as you keep in mind evidently when now as you keep in mind evidently when we see data especially observational we see data especially observational we see data especially observational data in human populations comparing the data in human populations comparing the data in human populations comparing the consumption of animal food with some consumption of animal food with some consumption of animal food with some kind of disease outcome we should keep kind of disease outcome we should keep kind of disease outcome we should keep in mind that as animal food consumption in mind that as animal food consumption in mind that as animal food consumption increases are the percentage of the diet increases are the percentage of the diet increases are the percentage of the diet plant food goes down so when we see a plant food goes down so when we see a plant food goes down so when we see a relationship with animal protein also relationship with animal protein also relationship with animal protein also showing it in a little bit showing it in a little bit showing it in a little bit that tends to reflect also a decrease in that tends to reflect also a decrease in that tends to reflect also a decrease in consumption of plant foods which have a consumption of plant foods which have a consumption of plant foods which have a lot of wonderful antioxidants and other lot of wonderful antioxidants and other lot of wonderful antioxidants and other substances to prevent disease substances to prevent disease substances to prevent disease you know this is uh when I was going up you know this is uh when I was going up you know this is uh when I was going up on the farm this is what I sort of on the farm this is what I sort of on the farm this is what I sort of learned and most people sort of accepted learned and most people sort of accepted learned and most people sort of accepted this is almost the ideal of North and this is almost the ideal of North and this is almost the ideal of North and diet diet diet quite frankly though we consume this quite frankly though we consume this quite frankly though we consume this food was without knowing it it's almost food was without knowing it it's almost food was without knowing it it's almost unconscious if you will we consume it unconscious if you will we consume it unconscious if you will we consume it because we want to make sure we get because we want to make sure we get because we want to make sure we get enough protein enough protein enough protein I'm going to argue that the protein in I'm going to argue that the protein in I'm going to argue that the protein in animal food animal food animal food uh basically is is so prominent we don't uh basically is is so prominent we don't uh basically is is so prominent we don't even hardly thinking we just take it for even hardly thinking we just take it for even hardly thinking we just take it for granted it's so important I'm going to granted it's so important I'm going to granted it's so important I'm going to call it the driver nutrient

going on that as conversation that's now going on that as conversation that's now going on that as I see it uh primarily is how are we I see it uh primarily is how are we I see it uh primarily is how are we going to meet the demand for production going to meet the demand for production going to meet the demand for production of more animal food presumably because of more animal food presumably because of more animal food presumably because it's so important that's our state it's so important that's our state it's so important that's our state repairs today repairs today repairs today now ethical bash is a step or two now ethical bash is a step or two now ethical bash is a step or two uh to my own sort of intro into this uh to my own sort of intro into this uh to my own sort of intro into this field many years ago field many years ago field many years ago um in graduate school I did a degree I um in graduate school I did a degree I um in graduate school I did a degree I did my doctoral dissertation in fact on did my doctoral dissertation in fact on did my doctoral dissertation in fact on promoting the consumption of more animal promoting the consumption of more animal promoting the consumption of more animal protein more efficiently protein more efficiently protein more efficiently and then and then and then after that in my first after that in my first after that in my first academic academic position academic academic position academic academic position we had a grant from the U.S state we had a grant from the U.S state we had a grant from the U.S state Department there this Virginia Tech Department there this Virginia Tech Department there this Virginia Tech University we are Grant from the state University we are Grant from the state University we are Grant from the state department that was intended to develop department that was intended to develop department that was intended to develop a model for working with malnourished a model for working with malnourished a model for working with malnourished children feeding around their children children feeding around their children children feeding around their children there again the thought was these there again the thought was these there again the thought was these children were malnourished primarily children were malnourished primarily children were malnourished primarily because they weren't getting enough because they weren't getting enough because they weren't getting enough protein so I'm schooled in this idea protein so I'm schooled in this idea protein so I'm schooled in this idea that the more protein the better that the more protein the better that the more protein the better however I saw something in the children however I saw something in the children however I saw something in the children that didn't exactly square with that that didn't exactly square with that that didn't exactly square with that presumption that bias I should say presumption that bias I should say presumption that bias I should say namely I was told by my medical namely I was told by my medical namely I was told by my medical colleagues one day in the Philippines colleagues one day in the Philippines colleagues one day in the Philippines when we were there when we were there when we were there that they were operating some children that they were operating some children that they were operating some children four years of age and younger for liver four years of age and younger for liver four years of age and younger for liver cancer that is really odd I went back to cancer that is really odd I went back to cancer that is really odd I went back to look at some of the nutritional data we look at some of the nutritional data we look at some of the nutritional data we had got the impression that the children had got the impression that the children had got the impression that the children were likely to get the liver cancer were were likely to get the liver cancer were were likely to get the liver cancer were the ones consuming the what were the the ones consuming the what were the the ones consuming the what were the ones from the families consuming the ones from the families consuming the ones from the families consuming the most protein pretty odd more protein most protein pretty odd more protein most protein pretty odd more protein more calcium same makes sense to me but more calcium same makes sense to me but more calcium same makes sense to me but in any case this study then came out in any case this study then came out in any case this study then came out from India now 54 years ago from India now 54 years ago from India now 54 years ago where they were also suggesting that if where they were also suggesting that if where they were also suggesting that if these children were to consume more these children were to consume more these children were to consume more protein they would have less liver protein they would have less liver protein they would have less liver cancer liver cancer is a big problem in cancer liver cancer is a big problem in cancer liver cancer is a big problem in Asia by the way Asia by the way Asia by the way so they did a little study with animals so they did a little study with animals so they did a little study with animals and they got these results animals given and they got these results animals given and they got these results animals given the higher levels of protein 20 percent the higher levels of protein 20 percent the higher levels of protein 20 percent are tall calories are tall calories are tall calories um compared to animals given the lower um compared to animals given the lower um compared to animals given the lower levels of five percent levels of five percent levels of five percent uh both of them both groups were uh both of them both groups were uh both of them both groups were initiated with a carcinogen so as we say initiated with a carcinogen so as we say initiated with a carcinogen so as we say in any case the animals given higher in any case the animals given higher in any case the animals given higher levels of protein they were the ones who levels of protein they were the ones who levels of protein they were the ones who got the cancer got the cancer got the cancer [Music] [Music] [Music] once given lower those did not exactly once given lower those did not exactly once given lower those did not exactly at this what they thought at this what they thought at this what they thought this coincided with some of the this coincided with some of the this coincided with some of the Impressions that I was getting with the Impressions that I was getting with the Impressions that I was getting with the children children children so led to this a really striking so led to this a really striking so led to this a really striking notion increasing protein increasing notion increasing protein increasing notion increasing protein increasing cancer sound crazy cancer sound crazy cancer sound crazy so I came back home to my laboratory at so I came back home to my laboratory at so I came back home to my laboratory at the Virginia Tech and got some money the Virginia Tech and got some money the Virginia Tech and got some money from the NIH a grant that continued to from the NIH a grant that continued to from the NIH a grant that continued to the next 27 years ago well we had a the next 27 years ago well we had a the next 27 years ago well we had a chance to really ask that question chance to really ask that question chance to really ask that question is it possible that animal protein could is it possible that animal protein could is it possible that animal protein could increase cancer and I could just show increase cancer and I could just show increase cancer and I could just show you a ton of studies but I'm going to you a ton of studies but I'm going to you a ton of studies but I'm going to just focus on one for to to because it just focus on one for to to because it just focus on one for to to because it really really really convinced me that there's something here convinced me that there's something here convinced me that there's something here I mean I was inclined to really doubt I mean I was inclined to really doubt I mean I was inclined to really doubt this but we did this I want to show you this but we did this I want to show you this but we did this I want to show you what we did what we did what we did this is the growth of in animals this is the growth of in animals this is the growth of in animals experimental rats this is the growth of experimental rats this is the growth of experimental rats this is the growth of cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 weeks weeks weeks animals fed 20 protein with the Indian animals fed 20 protein with the Indian animals fed 20 protein with the Indian workers did and you can see it's one workers did and you can see it's one workers did and you can see it's one brother well animals give it five brother well animals give it five brother well animals give it five percent did not let me write there is it percent did not let me write there is it percent did not let me write there is it was affirmation and as I said what the was affirmation and as I said what the was affirmation and as I said what the Indian workers have done if you will but Indian workers have done if you will but Indian workers have done if you will but then we did something more that was then we did something more that was then we did something more that was really striking really striking really striking I wanted to see what would happen if we I wanted to see what would happen if we I wanted to see what would happen if we switched the dice during that 12-week switched the dice during that 12-week switched the dice during that 12-week period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and vice versa this is just one vice versa this is just one vice versa this is just one representation of that representation of that representation of that and what results breaking we could and what results breaking we could and what results breaking we could control cancer development simply by control cancer development simply by control cancer development simply by adjusting this nutrient intake adjusting this nutrient intake adjusting this nutrient intake suggesting that nutrition might be suggesting that nutrition might be suggesting that nutrition might be important in controlling whether or not important in controlling whether or not important in controlling whether or not cancer works or not was really quite cancer works or not was really quite cancer works or not was really quite dramatic we did this kind of study in dramatic we did this kind of study in dramatic we did this kind of study in many different ways and I can tell you many different ways and I can tell you many different ways and I can tell you it's there it's true it's there it's true it's there it's true so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh at that time Now supported I think by at that time Now supported I think by at that time Now supported I think by more information namely a nutrition more information namely a nutrition more information namely a nutrition rather than genes controls cancer rather than genes controls cancer rather than genes controls cancer development uh what a revelation that development uh what a revelation that development uh what a revelation that was was was turned out is that not only that the turned out is that not only that the turned out is that not only that the protein we were using was animal-based protein we were using was animal-based protein we were using was animal-based it was small things it was protein of it was small things it was protein of it was small things it was protein of cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cows and and here casein was the one cows and and here casein was the one cows and and here casein was the one that was turning the cancer on that was turning the cancer on that was turning the cancer on a little bit later we tried to see what a little bit later we tried to see what a little bit later we tried to see what not so plant proteins like soy and we not so plant proteins like soy and we not so plant proteins like soy and we could do that didn't Infuse experiments could do that didn't Infuse experiments could do that didn't Infuse experiments on that different students were involved on that different students were involved on that different students were involved in it and sodium protein does not in it and sodium protein does not in it and sodium protein does not increase cancer development even when increase cancer development even when increase cancer development even when fed at the 20 level fed at the 20 level fed at the 20 level so it really puts a finger pointer at so it really puts a finger pointer at so it really puts a finger pointer at the finger right at animal protein as the finger right at animal protein as the finger right at animal protein as being the problem turning into cancer being the problem turning into cancer being the problem turning into cancer that being said it also seemed to apply that being said it also seemed to apply that being said it also seemed to apply to other animal proteins in general you to other animal proteins in general you to other animal proteins in general you know getting more into that in my second know getting more into that in my second know getting more into that in my second commentary but in any case if animal commentary but in any case if animal commentary but in any case if animal proteins cause cancer proteins cause cancer proteins cause cancer the notion occurred to me this is back the notion occurred to me this is back the notion occurred to me this is back in the 1980s in the 1980s in the 1980s the notion occurred to me that maybe the notion occurred to me that maybe the notion occurred to me that maybe this might apply to other diseases as this might apply to other diseases as this might apply to other diseases as well and similarly Betty plant Foods well and similarly Betty plant Foods well and similarly Betty plant Foods particular fruits is in this case that particular fruits is in this case that particular fruits is in this case that might tend to prevent that might tend to prevent that might tend to prevent that so with that in mind uh still not so with that in mind uh still not so with that in mind uh still not totally convinced that this animal totally convinced that this animal totally convinced that this animal protein affects what's Real uh I wanted protein affects what's Real uh I wanted protein affects what's Real uh I wanted to know what the mechanism was I spent to know what the mechanism was I spent to know what the mechanism was I spent the first 10 12 years of my career the first 10 12 years of my career the first 10 12 years of my career actually formally in as a professional actually formally in as a professional actually formally in as a professional in the pharmacology community in the pharmacology community in the pharmacology community uh you know all about drugs and how to uh you know all about drugs and how to uh you know all about drugs and how to use drugs and stuff like that so I'm use drugs and stuff like that so I'm use drugs and stuff like that so I'm very conscious was at that time of what very conscious was at that time of what very conscious was at that time of what drugs can do and here's here's the drugs can do and here's here's the drugs can do and here's here's the thought we tend to have in research of thought we tend to have in research of thought we tend to have in research of this kind this kind this kind if we see something we don't like animal if we see something we don't like animal if we see something we don't like animal protein causes cancer maybe we could protein causes cancer maybe we could protein causes cancer maybe we could find a mechanism for that effect that find a mechanism for that effect that find a mechanism for that effect that would lend itself to the development of would lend itself to the development of would lend itself to the development of a drug to block it there's something a drug to block it there's something a drug to block it there's something like statins being used about you know like statins being used about you know like statins being used about you know the the enzyme mechanism that is the the enzyme mechanism that is the the enzyme mechanism that is associated with heart disease so that associated with heart disease so that associated with heart disease so that was the thought maybe we could find the was the thought maybe we could find the was the thought maybe we could find the mechanism so we set about looking for mechanism so we set about looking for mechanism so we set about looking for mechanisms these studies went over a mechanisms these studies went over a mechanisms these studies went over a period went on over a period at least period went on over a period at least period went on over a period at least got 10 12 years or so got 10 12 years or so got 10 12 years or so and I kept looking for the mechanism and I kept looking for the mechanism and I kept looking for the mechanism they Mack Henderson that might account they Mack Henderson that might account they Mack Henderson that might account for this and and making those kind of for this and and making those kind of for this and and making those kind of studies we tended to in experimental studies we tended to in experimental studies we tended to in experimental cancer research we tended to think of cancer research we tended to think of cancer research we tended to think of cancerous then composed of three stages cancerous then composed of three stages cancerous then composed of three stages the first date is initiation that's when the first date is initiation that's when the first date is initiation that's when the cancer is forming from a mutation of the cancer is forming from a mutation of the cancer is forming from a mutation of mutated genes secondly we talk about a mutated genes secondly we talk about a mutated genes secondly we talk about a stage that takes a much longer period of stage that takes a much longer period of stage that takes a much longer period of time for promotion that's when the new time for promotion that's when the new time for promotion that's when the new cancer cells was formed then are divided cancer cells was formed then are divided cancer cells was formed then are divided and divided dividing and growing into and divided dividing and growing into and divided dividing and growing into tumors well and then the third stage is tumors well and then the third stage is tumors well and then the third stage is when the cancer is breaking away from when the cancer is breaking away from when the cancer is breaking away from this tissue of origin and going this tissue of origin and going this tissue of origin and going someplace else we call it metastasis and someplace else we call it metastasis and someplace else we call it metastasis and that is called progression so with that that is called progression so with that that is called progression so with that in mind in mind in mind I wanted to say you know what is the I wanted to say you know what is the I wanted to say you know what is the mechanism so we started out early in the mechanism so we started out early in the mechanism so we started out early in the simplest level looking for a mechanism simplest level looking for a mechanism simplest level looking for a mechanism in the first stage in the first stage in the first stage um and that and then we started finding um and that and then we started finding um and that and then we started finding Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism multiplied the entire doctoral multiplied the entire doctoral multiplied the entire doctoral dissertation of the student because dissertation of the student because dissertation of the student because there's a lot of work doing these kind there's a lot of work doing these kind there's a lot of work doing these kind of things of things of things in any case without a number of in any case without a number of in any case without a number of mechanisms that seem to be involved in mechanisms that seem to be involved in mechanisms that seem to be involved in initiation initiating the cancer initiation initiating the cancer initiation initiating the cancer the high protein diet could increase the the high protein diet could increase the the high protein diet could increase the rate of entry into of the car citizens rate of entry into of the car citizens rate of entry into of the car citizens into the cell oh that's pretty important into the cell oh that's pretty important into the cell oh that's pretty important when a course sentences get inside when a course sentences get inside when a course sentences get inside themselves they are metabolized by a themselves they are metabolized by a themselves they are metabolized by a mixed function oxidase enzyme system and mixed function oxidase enzyme system and mixed function oxidase enzyme system and methyl methyl methyl and what we found there was that and by and what we found there was that and by and what we found there was that and by the way it's metabolized to produce a the way it's metabolized to produce a the way it's metabolized to produce a product that's very reactive that then product that's very reactive that then product that's very reactive that then binds to the DNA of genes that's what binds to the DNA of genes that's what binds to the DNA of genes that's what indications occur what we found was that indications occur what we found was that indications occur what we found was that the high animal protein consumption the high animal protein consumption the high animal protein consumption increased the amount of enzyme being increased the amount of enzyme being increased the amount of enzyme being synthesized it increases rearrassed the synthesized it increases rearrassed the synthesized it increases rearrassed the structure so it became more accurate and structure so it became more accurate and structure so it became more accurate and then in turn it increased The Binding of then in turn it increased The Binding of then in turn it increased The Binding of the product that really reactive product the product that really reactive product the product that really reactive product of the imitation it increased the of the imitation it increased the of the imitation it increased the product to the DNA which was the product to the DNA which was the product to the DNA which was the beginning of limitation beginning of limitation beginning of limitation but then we have a incidentally a repair but then we have a incidentally a repair but then we have a incidentally a repair mechanism that keeps that under control mechanism that keeps that under control mechanism that keeps that under control if you will it's working all the time in if you will it's working all the time in if you will it's working all the time in our bodies it's called DNA repair what our bodies it's called DNA repair what our bodies it's called DNA repair what we found there was that high protein we found there was that high protein we found there was that high protein diet actually turned it off I mean the diet actually turned it off I mean the diet actually turned it off I mean the thing that's been protecting us the high thing that's been protecting us the high thing that's been protecting us the high protein does turn it off so there's a protein does turn it off so there's a protein does turn it off so there's a bunch of mechanisms in that first stage bunch of mechanisms in that first stage bunch of mechanisms in that first stage I'm getting a little bit frustrated I'm getting a little bit frustrated I'm getting a little bit frustrated maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're looking at here by this time looking at here by this time looking at here by this time so we turned her attention to the second so we turned her attention to the second so we turned her attention to the second stage now the second stage you'll notice stage now the second stage you'll notice stage now the second stage you'll notice I put arrows reversible arrows as a I put arrows reversible arrows as a I put arrows reversible arrows as a result of the research that we were result of the research that we were result of the research that we were doing turning cancer involved doing turning cancer involved doing turning cancer involved um and so in the second stage we started um and so in the second stage we started um and so in the second stage we started looking for mechanisms again we found a looking for mechanisms again we found a looking for mechanisms again we found a bunch of mechanisms uh one here in bunch of mechanisms uh one here in bunch of mechanisms uh one here in yellow that was a good one that's called yellow that was a good one that's called yellow that was a good one that's called natural killer cell activity no these natural killer cell activity no these natural killer cell activity no these are done by the way it's about 25 30 are done by the way it's about 25 30 are done by the way it's about 25 30 years ago natural killer cells now are years ago natural killer cells now are years ago natural killer cells now are the topic of discussion these days for the topic of discussion these days for the topic of discussion these days for trying to figure out a drug that enhance trying to figure out a drug that enhance trying to figure out a drug that enhance their activity but in any case their activity but in any case their activity but in any case we found that the high protein diet we found that the high protein diet we found that the high protein diet decreased decreased decreased natural killer cells the good stuff and natural killer cells the good stuff and natural killer cells the good stuff and increase the rate at which cells divide increase the rate at which cells divide increase the rate at which cells divide it increased the ability of the of the it increased the ability of the of the it increased the ability of the of the uh the protein increased the ability to uh the protein increased the ability to uh the protein increased the ability to approaching the form very reactive approaching the form very reactive approaching the form very reactive compounds called ocean radicals compounds called ocean radicals compounds called ocean radicals caution caution caution pre-reactive oxygen species something I pre-reactive oxygen species something I pre-reactive oxygen species something I can say it also did some of the can say it also did some of the can say it also did some of the increased the production of hormone and increased the production of hormone and increased the production of hormone and altered calories so we here we had all altered calories so we here we had all altered calories so we here we had all these mechanisms just kept popping up these mechanisms just kept popping up these mechanisms just kept popping up every time that and I said this was every time that and I said this was every time that and I said this was going over a period at least 10 12 even going over a period at least 10 12 even going over a period at least 10 12 even even longer I guess for doing this kind even longer I guess for doing this kind even longer I guess for doing this kind of research so in a summary we found of research so in a summary we found of research so in a summary we found that eight of these mechanisms uh that eight of these mechanisms uh that eight of these mechanisms uh increased cancer uh and two of them that increased cancer uh and two of them that increased cancer uh and two of them that were good and they were turned off so we were good and they were turned off so we were good and they were turned off so we got 10 mechanisms wow got 10 mechanisms wow got 10 mechanisms wow all 10 worked in the unison all 10 worked in the unison all 10 worked in the unison to increase cancer that was the thought to increase cancer that was the thought to increase cancer that was the thought that I found really quite remarkable that I found really quite remarkable that I found really quite remarkable it's not about one mechanism all of a it's not about one mechanism all of a it's not about one mechanism all of a sudden I started losing my interest in sudden I started losing my interest in sudden I started losing my interest in the idea that there was one mechanism the idea that there was one mechanism the idea that there was one mechanism that might lend itself to let's say that might lend itself to let's say that might lend itself to let's say pharmacologic treatment pharmacologic treatment pharmacologic treatment instead there's nutrition was just instead there's nutrition was just instead there's nutrition was just everything was just going wrong at the everything was just going wrong at the everything was just going wrong at the same time we we've worked on 10 I could same time we we've worked on 10 I could same time we we've worked on 10 I could probably put up another couple here that probably put up another couple here that probably put up another couple here that we had information on I'm sure now is we had information on I'm sure now is we had information on I'm sure now is far more than that far more than that far more than that but the point is the high protein diet but the point is the high protein diet but the point is the high protein diet just changed all these mechanisms almost just changed all these mechanisms almost just changed all these mechanisms almost simultaneously to do the same thing simultaneously to do the same thing simultaneously to do the same thing in unison in unison in unison so as far as drug intervention is so as far as drug intervention is so as far as drug intervention is concerned forget it that's not the way concerned forget it that's not the way concerned forget it that's not the way to solve the problem to solve the problem to solve the problem it'll bring to your attention the use of it'll bring to your attention the use of it'll bring to your attention the use of statins for example that's been invented statins for example that's been invented statins for example that's been invented created billions of dollars of profit created billions of dollars of

heart disease doesn't work that way not like that does doesn't work that way not like that does doesn't work that way not like that does so which mechanism which drug that was a so which mechanism which drug that was a so which mechanism which drug that was a dead end Street yeah I know I want to dead end Street yeah I know I want to dead end Street yeah I know I want to just tell you one more story in this just tell you one more story in this just tell you one more story in this first presentation that kind of fit in first presentation that kind of fit in first presentation that kind of fit in pretty well with what I was learning pretty well with what I was learning pretty well with what I was learning about all these mechanisms of working about all these mechanisms of working about all these mechanisms of working together as animal protein that was together as animal protein that was together as animal protein that was doing it not plant protein doing it not plant protein doing it not plant protein recently I had a chance to go back into recently I had a chance to go back into recently I had a chance to go back into the literature and look at let's say the literature and look at let's say the literature and look at let's say some researchers that may have compared some researchers that may have compared some researchers that may have compared animal protein intake against some animal protein intake against some animal protein intake against some disease disease disease and found quite a few cure or something and found quite a few cure or something and found quite a few cure or something here's a plot of a researcher some years here's a plot of a researcher some years here's a plot of a researcher some years ago ago ago who found that increasing among you know who found that increasing among you know who found that increasing among you know these are different countries okay these are different countries okay these are different countries okay United States is right there you can see United States is right there you can see United States is right there you can see among different countries you can see as among different countries you can see as among different countries you can see as daily animal protein consumption goes up daily animal protein consumption goes up daily animal protein consumption goes up renal cancer goes up real cancer renal cancer goes up real cancer renal cancer goes up real cancer incidence that's kidney cancer incidence that's kidney cancer incidence that's kidney cancer uh I drew that line there myself uh I drew that line there myself uh I drew that line there myself um and it turns out that it was a um and it turns out that it was a um and it turns out that it was a according to an algorithm according to an algorithm according to an algorithm characteristics or conditions if you characteristics or conditions if you characteristics or conditions if you will will will um in any case what we see here is is um in any case what we see here is is um in any case what we see here is is almost a straight-line relationship almost a straight-line relationship almost a straight-line relationship really impressive really impressive really impressive in other words decrease in animal in other words decrease in animal in other words decrease in animal protection consumption brings to kidney protection consumption brings to kidney protection consumption brings to kidney cancer risk down to just above zero cancer risk down to just above zero cancer risk down to just above zero here's another one here's a paper here's another one here's a paper here's another one here's a paper published in 1959 by a member of a published in 1959 by a member of a published in 1959 by a member of a jolliff an older man at the time when I jolliff an older man at the time when I jolliff an older man at the time when I was a registered I I actually met him was a registered I I actually met him was a registered I I actually met him and he what he showed was that and he what he showed was that and he what he showed was that increasing protein consumption for increasing protein consumption for increasing protein consumption for different countries so just by numbers different countries so just by numbers different countries so just by numbers here increasing protein increased here increasing protein increased here increasing protein increased heart disease deaths again I draw the heart disease deaths again I draw the heart disease deaths again I draw the line through there and what I get is line through there and what I get is line through there and what I get is this just like that this just like that this just like that here's another one it's more recent here's another one it's more recent here's another one it's more recent times here's a relationship between times here's a relationship between times here's a relationship between non-fat milk consumption and prostate non-fat milk consumption and prostate non-fat milk consumption and prostate cancer wow that line just come right cancer wow that line just come right cancer wow that line just come right down closer to the zero there you have down closer to the zero there you have down closer to the zero there you have it right there and so it looks like not it right there and so it looks like not it right there and so it looks like not that milk skim milk if you will is that milk skim milk if you will is that milk skim milk if you will is better than whole milk that's what that better than whole milk that's what that better than whole milk that's what that suggests suggests suggests we did that on the farm by the way uh we did that on the farm by the way uh we did that on the farm by the way uh when it first came out about fat we were when it first came out about fat we were when it first came out about fat we were basically Central Fusion or melting basically Central Fusion or melting basically Central Fusion or melting making skim milk but that's set that making skim milk but that's set that making skim milk but that's set that aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat skim milk the good stuff a lot of people skim milk the good stuff a lot of people skim milk the good stuff a lot of people thought It's associated with prostate thought It's associated with prostate thought It's associated with prostate cancer wow cancer wow cancer wow here's one my good friend from the here's one my good friend from the here's one my good friend from the University of Western Ontario in Canada University of Western Ontario in Canada University of Western Ontario in Canada Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of countries and he was looking at the risk countries and he was looking at the risk countries and he was looking at the risk to the dietary infection on the breast to the dietary infection on the breast to the dietary infection on the breast cancer or mortality for a different cancer or mortality for a different cancer or mortality for a different watches of countries watches of countries watches of countries and he concluded that as total fat and he concluded that as total fat and he concluded that as total fat increases I've come to that ammonia the increases I've come to that ammonia the increases I've come to that ammonia the the risk of drug breast cancer went up the risk of drug breast cancer went up the risk of drug breast cancer went up but more particularly it was a saturated but more particularly it was a saturated but more particularly it was a saturated fat common in animal Foods that's where fat common in animal Foods that's where fat common in animal Foods that's where the line really occurred very impressive the line really occurred very impressive the line really occurred very impressive once again the lines from weight down once again the lines from weight down once again the lines from weight down through almost there if you will through almost there if you will through almost there if you will there's another one there's another one there's another one this is reversing the axis the the this is reversing the axis the the this is reversing the axis the the cholesterol the dietary things on the cholesterol the dietary things on the cholesterol the dietary things on the y-axis in this case but what it shows is y-axis in this case but what it shows is y-axis in this case but what it shows is that again heart disease risk is that again heart disease risk is that again heart disease risk is increased for these different countries increased for these different countries increased for these different countries there's the U.S way up here any priest there's the U.S way up here any priest there's the U.S way up here any priest with all these countries has cholesterol with all these countries has cholesterol with all these countries has cholesterol intake goes up now cholesterol comes intake goes up now cholesterol comes intake goes up now cholesterol comes from animal food only right from animal food only right from animal food only right so we've got now cholesterol calcium so we've got now cholesterol calcium so we've got now cholesterol calcium heart disease it looks like heart disease it looks like heart disease it looks like um here's one for meat consumption and um here's one for meat consumption and um here's one for meat consumption and colon cancer still another research colon cancer still another research colon cancer still another research group group group here's one for uterine cancer and total here's one for uterine cancer and total here's one for uterine cancer and total fat it's like total fat then it tend to fat it's like total fat then it tend to fat it's like total fat then it tend to reflects uh animal food consumption by reflects uh animal food consumption by reflects uh animal food consumption by the way for different countries the way for different countries the way for different countries and finally and finally and finally this impression appearance namely all this impression appearance namely all this impression appearance namely all these different things whether it's meat these different things whether it's meat these different things whether it's meat intake or whether it's total fat intake intake or whether it's total fat intake intake or whether it's total fat intake or stem milk or cholesterol whatever or stem milk or cholesterol whatever or stem milk or cholesterol whatever these are animal protein circuits now these are animal protein circuits now these are animal protein circuits now that's a really important part to make that's a really important part to make that's a really important part to make because the researchers who focus on because the researchers who focus on because the researchers who focus on each one of these individual things that each one of these individual things that each one of these individual things that in turn tended to generate a lot of in turn tended to generate a lot of in turn tended to generate a lot of interest in that one thing interest in that one thing interest in that one thing and a lot of researchers done you know and a lot of researchers done you know and a lot of researchers done you know something's wrong with let's say something's wrong with let's say something's wrong with let's say saturated fat something's wrong with saturated fat something's wrong with saturated fat something's wrong with some names what's kind of meat you know some names what's kind of meat you know some names what's kind of meat you know or I mean that focus on one thing at a or I mean that focus on one thing at a or I mean that focus on one thing at a time just just export it into time just just export it into time just just export it into further questions as to what's special further questions as to what's special further questions as to what's special about that particular kind of flu or about that particular kind of flu or about that particular kind of flu or Newton Newton Newton so I call them animal protein surgery so I call them animal protein surgery so I call them animal protein surgery it's all shown the same thing it's all shown the same thing it's all shown the same thing so what's common to them what's Karma so what's common to them what's Karma so what's common to them what's Karma job is the protein job is the protein job is the protein is animal protein so on that question by is animal protein so on that question by is animal protein so on that question by the way uh my friend tantaro was he was the way uh my friend tantaro was he was the way uh my friend tantaro was he was looking at the saturated fat versus looking at the saturated fat versus looking at the saturated fat versus breast cancer thing he also had breast cancer thing he also had breast cancer thing he also had information on the conceptual plant information on the conceptual plant information on the conceptual plant protein he didn't call it plant protein protein he didn't call it plant protein protein he didn't call it plant protein to call it unsaturated fat to call it unsaturated fat to call it unsaturated fat but there's no relationship no but there's no relationship no but there's no relationship no relationship so this team this these relationship so this team this these relationship so this team this these linear regressions seem to be uh linear regressions seem to be uh linear regressions seem to be uh basically four animal food not plant for basically four animal food not plant for basically four animal food not plant for animal protein in particular animal protein in particular animal protein in particular so let me leave that with you for the so let me leave that with you for the so let me leave that with you for the moment moment moment um and uh just remind us that what what um and uh just remind us that what what um and uh just remind us that what what an attempted

the and the food we eat it causes the and the food we eat it causes the problems is characterized by the problems is characterized by the problems is characterized by the fascination that we have for animal fascination that we have for animal fascination that we have for animal protein thank you okay back again uh for the second half okay back again uh for the second half of this commentary uh and before getting of this commentary uh and before getting of this commentary uh and before getting into the comments here uh let me just into the comments here uh let me just into the comments here uh let me just briefly just highlight a couple of briefly just highlight a couple of briefly just highlight a couple of points I was tempted to make in the points I was tempted to make in the points I was tempted to make in the first part a few a few points that we first part a few a few points that we first part a few a few points that we might consider so far might consider so far might consider so far um first um first um first um as I mentioned I'm really addressing um as I mentioned I'm really addressing um as I mentioned I'm really addressing a an issue having to do with multiple a an

and planetary health and or human and planetary health and or human and planetary health and suggesting in fact to working toward the suggesting in fact to working toward the suggesting in fact to working toward the idea that there's one main cause the idea that there's one main cause the idea that there's one main cause the possible one main solution to solving is possible one main solution to solving is possible one main solution to solving is very complicated set of problems very complicated set of problems very complicated set of problems and I'm suggesting too as she already and I'm suggesting too as she already and I'm suggesting too as she already heard from the first commentary I'm heard from the first commentary I'm heard from the first commentary I'm suggesting that it's our fascination suggesting that it's our fascination suggesting that it's our fascination or long-time fascination with high or long-time fascination with high or long-time fascination with high quality animal protein quality animal protein quality animal protein you know a lot of people think protein you know a lot of people think protein you know a lot of people think protein is just in animals it's not quite but at is just in animals it's not quite but at is just in animals it's not quite but at least it's high quality fascination with least it's high quality fascination with least it's high quality fascination with high quality animal protein and I'm high quality animal protein and I'm high quality animal protein and I'm going to say that this is the main going to say that this is the main going to say that this is the main driver driver driver of food production of food production of food production and food shorts and food shorts and food shorts for well over a century for well over a century for well over a century and I want to talk about that the and I want to talk about that the and I want to talk about that the consequences of that Fascination example consequences of that Fascination example consequences of that Fascination example of protein if the world of protein if the world of protein if the world I want to talk a little bit about the I want to talk a little bit about the I want to talk a little bit about the origin the consequences of this origin the consequences of this origin the consequences of this fascination fascination fascination On the Origin I want to go back to On the Origin I want to go back to On the Origin I want to go back to Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who discovered protein well he was he had uh discovered protein well he was he had uh discovered protein well he was he had uh he was doing a dog experiment actually he was doing a dog experiment actually he was doing a dog experiment actually and the dog was eating meat and he and the dog was eating meat and he and the dog was eating meat and he realized that the dog had to have some realized that the dog had to have some realized that the dog had to have some meat or would die or suffer problems and meat or would die or suffer problems and meat or would die or suffer problems and so he said he's a chemist he set out to so he said he's a chemist he set out to so he said he's a chemist he set out to try to find in there or something in try to find in there or something in try to find in there or something in there they might be able to isolate he there they might be able to isolate he there they might be able to isolate he found a compound a material had to give found a compound a material had to give found a compound a material had to give it a name it a name it a name he gave it a name after the Greek word he gave it a name after the Greek word he

what is perfect quality I concerning what is perfect quality I said you know people we tend to think said you know people we tend to think said you know people we tend to think the protein the protein the protein that's quality and the quality protein that's quality and the quality protein that's quality and the quality protein high quality protein is in animal Foods high quality protein is in animal Foods high quality protein is in animal Foods I mean for many years for a lot of I mean for many years for a lot of I mean for many years for a lot of people thought protein only came from people thought protein only came from people thought protein only came from animal Foods animal Foods animal Foods benship was learned in the late 1800s benship was learned in the late 1800s benship was learned in the late 1800s early 1900s finds that protein too yeah early 1900s finds that protein too yeah early 1900s finds that protein too yeah over over that's not high quality let me over over that's not high quality let me over over that's not high quality let me go explore that story through that story go explore that story through that story go explore that story through that story with it with it with it high quality a really important concept high quality a really important concept high quality a really important concept people don't necessarily they haven't people don't necessarily they haven't people don't necessarily they haven't put it in their minds they don't put it in their minds they don't put it in their minds they don't necessarily you know think about it on a necessarily you know think about it on a necessarily you know think about it on a daily basis that's great to say it's daily basis that's great to say it's daily basis that's great to say it's really almost an unconscious really almost an unconscious really almost an unconscious subconscious kind of motion but high subconscious kind of motion but high subconscious kind of motion but high quality means in a laboratory means more quality means in a laboratory means more quality means in a laboratory means more dietary protein in a test period more dietary protein in a test period more dietary protein in a test period more dietary protein being retained by the dietary protein being retained by the dietary protein being retained by the body in a set period of time except it's body in a set period of time except it's body in a set period of time except it's kind of certain conditions kind of certain conditions kind of certain conditions and that in turn relates to a concept we and that in turn relates to a concept we and that in turn relates to a concept we call biological value that actually is call biological value that actually is call biological value that actually is what I really redid on myself in my what I really redid on myself in my what I really redid on myself in my inductive dissertation in years ago this inductive dissertation in years ago this inductive dissertation in years ago this whole concept of you know trying to find whole concept of you know trying to find whole concept of you know trying to find a protein that has the highest a protein that has the highest a protein that has the highest biological value or equality biological value or equality biological value or equality animal proteins by the way and I can't animal proteins by the way and I can't animal proteins by the way and I can't get into all the details here but it's get into all the details here but it's get into all the details here but it's convincingly I'll show you this animal convincingly I'll show you this animal convincingly I'll show you this animal proteins retain more of the protein they proteins retain more of the protein they proteins retain more of the protein they consume okay that's referred to as high consume okay that's referred to as high consume okay that's referred to as high quality plant proteins no reason as much quality plant proteins no reason as much quality plant proteins no reason as much they're low quality so animal proteins they're low quality so animal proteins they're low quality so animal proteins are high quality plant proteins are for are high quality plant proteins are for are high quality plant proteins are for low carbons everybody was quality right low carbons everybody was quality right low carbons everybody was quality right well that kind of equipment or well that kind of equipment or well that kind of equipment or Consciousness and uh so if you really Consciousness and uh so if you really Consciousness and uh so if you really want to get real protein eat animal want to get real protein eat animal want to get real protein eat animal protein uh if you don't want to do that protein uh if you don't want to do that protein uh if you don't want to do that then create the plant proteins in such a then create the plant proteins in such a then create the plant proteins in such a way that you get high quality okay way that you get high quality okay way that you get high quality okay that's been with us forever that's been with us forever that's been with us forever so this origin of the concept of high so this origin of the concept of high so this origin of the concept of high quality uh actually arose formally from quality uh actually arose formally from quality uh actually arose formally from a professor at the University of a professor at the University of a professor at the University of Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 and uh he is titled a message for and uh he is titled a message for and uh he is titled a message for determine the biological value of determine the biological value of determine the biological value of protein high quality well protein high quality well protein high quality well so it means more protein being retained so it means more protein being retained so it means more protein being retained well for what purpose well well for what purpose well well for what purpose well it actually related more protein is it actually related more protein is it actually related more protein is being retained by a given amount of being retained by a given amount of being retained by a given amount of protein The Bachelor rate of body weight protein The Bachelor rate of body weight protein The Bachelor rate of body weight gain right so it looked good growth go gain right so it looked good growth go gain right so it looked good growth go animals faster Bradley Sperma showed animals faster Bradley Sperma showed animals faster Bradley Sperma showed that Pegasus and so forth that in turn that Pegasus and so forth that in turn that Pegasus and so forth that in turn you know speeding up growths obviously you know speeding up growths obviously you know speeding up growths obviously means more profit for the means more profit for the means more profit for the livestock-based agriculture good deal so livestock-based agriculture good deal so livestock-based agriculture good deal so you want to stick to protein as high you want to stick to protein as high you want to stick to protein as high quality whoops but there's a problem with that whoops but there's a problem with that thought it's been around for ever it's thought it's been around for ever it's thought it's been around for ever it's in our Consciousness we don't think in our Consciousness we don't think in our Consciousness we don't think about it the public never thinks about about it the public never thinks about about it the public never thinks about it quite frankly that way but they just it quite frankly that way but they just it quite frankly that way but they just know whose protein know whose protein know whose protein it turns out in a more recent times and it turns out in a more recent times and it turns out in a more recent times and not so just reasons there's a couple of not so just reasons there's a couple of not so just reasons there's a couple of cases here quite a long time ago it cases here quite a long time ago it cases here quite a long time ago it turns out that the more protein being turns out that the more protein being turns out that the more protein being retained also does some other things retained also does some other things retained also does some other things look look look the higher the retention it increases the higher the retention it increases the higher the retention it increases growth hormone growth hormone growth hormone we showed that no rats it increases we showed that no rats it increases we showed that no rats it increases blood cholesterol blood estrogen levels blood cholesterol blood estrogen levels blood cholesterol blood estrogen levels that's a female hormone circulating that's a female hormone circulating that's a female hormone circulating hormone that relation turned to breast hormone that relation turned to breast hormone that relation turned to breast cancer earlier Asian men are more more cancer earlier Asian men are more more cancer earlier Asian men are more more urine tests and so forth so higher urine tests and so forth so higher urine tests and so forth so higher protein than retained means more growth protein than retained means more growth protein than retained means more growth hormone hormone hormone more estrogen it also turns on the more estrogen it also turns on the more estrogen it also turns on the production of so-called free radicals production of so-called free radicals production of so-called free radicals those are dangerous little things they those are dangerous little things they those are dangerous little things they can be useful they said your body the can be useful they said your body the can be useful they said your body the body has a way of using those things but body has a way of using those things but body has a way of using those things but when we increase the production free when we increase the production free when we increase the production free radicals filter Skelter they actually radicals filter Skelter they actually radicals filter Skelter they actually speed up aging they speed up Chancellor speed up aging they speed up Chancellor speed up aging they speed up Chancellor hyper uh this hot more protein retention hyper uh this hot more protein retention hyper uh this hot more protein retention also increases the production of also increases the production of also increases the production of potassium mutations I showed that in the potassium mutations I showed that in the potassium mutations I showed that in the last last last civil wrong research civil wrong research civil wrong research and a decrease in so-called natural and a decrease in so-called natural and a decrease in so-called natural killer cells T cells killer cells T cells killer cells T cells and a decrease in DNA repair the two and a

does that all of these the high protein does that all of these the high protein does that all of these things here things here things here you know high protein protein I'm you know high protein protein I'm you know high protein protein I'm talking about high protein more talking about high protein more talking about high protein more retention it increases cancer but all retention it increases cancer but all retention it increases cancer but all these different mechanisms is that high these different mechanisms is that high these different mechanisms is that high quality quality quality we're also increasing this an old story we're also increasing this an old story we're also increasing this an old story here the the high quality proteins here the the high quality proteins here the the high quality proteins associate increases your own cholesterol associate increases your own cholesterol associate increases your own cholesterol that was first seen in 1906 and it was that was first seen in 1906 and it was that was first seen in 1906 and it was summarized in in the first in 1923 by a summarized in in the first in 1923 by a summarized in in the first in 1923 by a group at University of Michigan and then group at University of Michigan and then group at University of Michigan and then again in 1926 and it turns out that the again in 1926 and it turns out that the again in 1926 and it turns out that the real cause of increasing cholesterol and real cause of increasing cholesterol and real cause of increasing cholesterol and the heart disease that comes along with the heart disease that comes along with the heart disease that comes along with it is protein it's animal protein so it is protein it's animal protein so it is protein it's animal protein so that increases our disease okay that increases our disease okay that increases our disease okay incidentally that was summarized in 1926 incidentally that was summarized in 1926 incidentally that was summarized in 1926 as I just said 23 26 that's the time as I just said 23 26 that's the time as I just said 23 26 that's the time when Mitchell came along in Illinois when Mitchell came along in

increases blood sugar um it increases blood sugar uh all we need to say about that is that uh all we need to say about that is that uh all we need to say about that is that you know diabetics are on high sugar you know diabetics are on high sugar you know diabetics are on high sugar problems uh if they were to go on a low problems uh if they were to go on a low problems uh if they were to go on a low protein diet however protein the sugar protein diet however protein the sugar protein diet however protein the sugar drops okay A1C another indicator of drops okay A1C another indicator of drops okay A1C another indicator of course of not very diabetic risk so here course of not very diabetic risk so here course of not very diabetic risk so here we have all these things going on we have all

is that what we mean by high quality is that what we mean by high quality it's still with us in our consciousness it's still with us in our consciousness it's still with us in our consciousness that we have to eat the animal protein that we have to eat the animal protein that we have to eat the animal protein to get the high quality and even to get the high quality and even to get the high quality and even companies like impossible burger and companies like impossible burger and companies like impossible burger and others are trying to create you know a others are trying to create you know a others are trying to create you know a so-called plant protein but in the with so-called plant protein but in the with so-called plant protein but in the with the mindset that they wanted like a high the mindset that they wanted like a high the mindset that they wanted like a high quality high quality for it so I'm quality high quality for it so I'm quality high quality for it so I'm Arrangement is this really serious Arrangement is this really serious Arrangement is this really serious question here about what high quality question here about what high quality question here about what high quality remains okay enough said this remains okay enough said this remains okay enough said this I want to turn your attention now to I want to turn your attention now to I want to turn your attention now to what does this mean in terms of policy what does this mean in terms of policy what does this mean in terms of policy development development development calls it well calls it well calls it well I'm going to show you just a line here I'm going to show you just a line here I'm going to show you just a line here showing you the different amounts of showing you the different amounts of showing you the different amounts of protein being consumed if you will at protein being consumed if you will at protein being consumed if you will at different levels this is these are different levels this is these are different levels this is these are percent of total calories there's like percent of total calories there's like percent of total calories there's like five to six percent of protein uh five five to six percent of protein uh five five to six percent of protein uh five to six percent of total calories nine to to six percent of total calories nine to to six percent of total calories nine to ten eleven as you can see what am I ten eleven as you can see what am I ten eleven as you can see what am I going to be showing here first off going to be showing here first off going to be showing here first off the minimum amount of protein that we the minimum amount of protein that we the minimum amount of protein that we need and this was first learned more or need and this was first learned more or need and this was first learned more or less developed officially in the early less developed officially in the early less developed officially in the early 1940s the minimum amount of protein we 1940s the minimum amount of protein we 1940s the minimum amount of protein we need is about five to six percent of need is about five to six percent of need is about five to six percent of tenants that's all tenants that's all tenants that's all but that uh experimental result uh was but that uh experimental result uh was but that uh experimental result uh was then increased by a couple of standard then increased by a couple of standard then increased by a couple of standard deviations to make sure everybody in the deviations to make sure everybody in the deviations to make sure everybody in the protein and so that's what gave rise to protein and so that's what gave rise to protein and so that's what gave rise to the recommended dietary allowance okay the recommended dietary allowance okay the recommended dietary allowance okay serd that's the one everybody looks at serd that's the one everybody looks at serd that's the one everybody looks at thinks about it they think about any of thinks about it they think about any of thinks about it they think about any of this that's not the minimum amount we this that's not the minimum amount we this that's not the minimum amount we need by the way the minimum that is here need by the way the minimum that is here need by the way the minimum that is here this is the recommended level this is this is the recommended level this is this is the recommended level this is not for everybody basically not for everybody basically not for everybody basically um however um however um however in spite of those numbers uh over the in spite of those numbers uh over the in spite of those numbers uh over the years we've been consuming as a society years we've been consuming as a society years we've been consuming as a society at least in the United States in other at least in the United States in other at least in the United States in other Western countries too but you just the Western countries too but you just the Western countries too but you just the United States we consume protein United States we consume protein United States we consume protein right during this span here the black right during this span here the black right during this span here the black wire just the intake rings wire just the intake rings wire just the intake rings Integrations and what is that the extra Integrations and what is that the extra Integrations and what is that the extra protein that we're getting over above protein that we're getting over above protein that we're getting over above what we really need the extra protein we what we really need the extra protein we what we really need the extra protein we get it 75 to 80 percent of that comes get it 75 to 80 percent of that comes get it 75 to 80 percent of that comes from from from Hamilton Hamilton Hamilton so we have diets on average in this so we have diets on average in this so we have diets on average in this country this rich in animal food high country this rich in animal food high country this rich in animal food high quality quality quality and we actually consume as much as we and we actually consume as much as we and we actually consume as much as we can get way over what we need okay can get way over what we need okay can get way over what we need okay now I want to show you the real problem now I want to show you the real problem now I want to show you the real problem here we don't think of it here we don't think of it here we don't think of it that range of protein consumption that that range of protein consumption that that range of protein consumption that we're consuming from Mostly animal we're consuming from Mostly animal we're consuming from Mostly animal protein uh I'm going to superimpose protein uh I'm going to superimpose protein uh I'm going to superimpose those lines I showed you in the earlier those lines I showed you in the earlier those lines I showed you in the earlier presentation of the risk of disease that presentation of the risk of disease that presentation of the risk of disease that occurs you know by increasing protein occurs you know by increasing protein occurs you know by increasing protein consumption during this range here consumption during this range here consumption during this range here mostly from animal Foods we can expect mostly from animal Foods we can expect mostly from animal Foods we can expect to see an increase just like that in to see an increase just like that in to see an increase just like that in chronic disease risks there it is pretty chronic disease risks there it is pretty chronic disease risks there it is pretty plain straightforward quite simple plain straightforward quite simple plain straightforward quite simple and I might point out by the way that we and I might point out by the way that we and I might point out by the way that we only need 9 10 protein or so like that only need 9 10 protein or so like that only need 9 10 protein or so like that that's enough that's enough that's enough you know Whole Food plant-based diets you know Whole Food plant-based diets you know Whole Food plant-based diets provide all the protein we need at the provide all the protein we need at the provide all the protein we need at the right time it's the right time we do not right time it's the right time we do not right time it's the right time we do not there's no basis no basis for consuming there's no basis no basis for consuming there's no basis no basis for consuming animal food in order to get that animal food in order to get that animal food in order to get that so-called high quality protein that's so-called high quality protein that's so-called high quality protein that's nonsense nonsense nonsense uh and by the way hopefully plant-baside uh and by the way hopefully plant-baside uh and by the way hopefully plant-baside stage yes stage yes stage yes they they're as low as eight by ten they they're as low as eight by ten they they're as low as eight by ten percent protein maybe in some cases if percent protein maybe in some cases if percent protein maybe in some cases if you just eat potatoes so for example you just eat potatoes so for example you just eat potatoes so for example but in reality these are plant-based but in reality these are plant-based but in reality these are plant-based diets can go up to 15 even close 20 diets can go up to 15 even close 20 diets can go up to 15 even close 20 percent get a lot of views and things percent get a lot of views and things percent get a lot of views and things like that no problem like that no problem like that no problem because now you consuming Whole Food the because now you consuming Whole Food the because now you consuming Whole Food the protein is going to perform it don't do protein is going to perform it don't do protein is going to perform it don't do the same thing you're going to do all the same thing you're going to do all the same thing you're going to do all these things working too and that's just these things working too and that's just these things working too and that's just subject for another time but in any case subject for another time but in any case subject for another time but in any case Whole Food plant-based protein is enough Whole Food plant-based protein is enough Whole Food plant-based protein is enough and so what happened and so what happened and so what happened in 2002. by the way dietary guidelines in 2002. by the way dietary guidelines in 2002. by the way dietary guidelines uh in the United States are updated uh in the United States are updated uh in the United States are updated every five years with the committee every five years with the committee every five years with the committee uh usually it's the amount of protein uh usually it's the amount of protein uh usually it's the amount of protein needed in other nutrients needed are needed in other nutrients needed are needed in other nutrients needed are framed by the national academic science framed by the national academic science framed by the national academic science and then that's passed off to the doctor and then that's passed off to the doctor and then that's passed off to the doctor to the usaid doctor guidelines and so to the usaid doctor guidelines and so to the usaid doctor guidelines and so this what I'm showing you here right now this what I'm showing you here right now this what I'm showing you here right now in in 2002 a decision was made by the in in 2002 a decision was made by the in in 2002 a decision was made by the committee that determines how much committee that determines how much committee that determines how much nutrients you should have they want to nutrients you should have they want to nutrients you should have they want to sit an upper limit for nutrient intake sit an upper limit for nutrient intake sit an upper limit for nutrient intake upper safe limit for protein they said upper safe limit for protein they said upper safe limit for protein they said that's 35 percent that's 35 percent that's 35 percent we can't even get up to that here's we can't even get up to that here's we can't even get up to that here's where I see that line right there we where I see that line right there we where I see that line right there we can't even get it to 35 quite frankly can't even get it to 35 quite frankly can't even get it to 35 quite frankly it's very very difficult it's very very difficult it's very very difficult what this this was an invitation to what this this was an invitation to what this this was an invitation to consume as much high quality protein consume as much high quality protein consume as much high quality

cures all really stops are growth or cures all really quite amazing and this is all based on quite amazing and this is all based on quite amazing and this is all based on peer reviewed research on this so it's a peer reviewed research on this so it's a peer reviewed research on this so it's a bunch of different diseases now the bunch of different diseases now the bunch of different diseases now the individual researchers at that time individual researchers at that time individual researchers at that time didn't I use the term Whole Foods diet didn't I use the term Whole Foods diet didn't I use the term Whole Foods diet obviously obviously obviously but they were actually getting some but they were actually getting some but they were actually getting some results that could be interpreted in the results that could be interpreted in the results that could be interpreted in the context of modern information in the context of modern information in the context of modern

back and form the antibodies pretty back and form the antibodies pretty simple simple simple uh this as I say this is a data uh this as I say this is a data uh this as I say this is a data reflected in 1989 in China um it turns out that we had in that um it turns out that we had in that study as we had in the earlier we had a study as we had in the earlier we had a study as we had in the earlier we had a lot of lots of nutritional information lot of lots of nutritional information lot of lots of nutritional information to characterize these different steps in to characterize these different steps in to characterize these different steps in the pathway we had nutrition information the pathway we had nutrition information the pathway we had nutrition information to uh to show us you know what was to uh to show us you know what was to uh to show us you know what was associated with the formation antibodies associated with the formation antibodies associated with the formation

want to say let me serious cancer if I want to say let me serious cancer if I want to say let me tell you it comes from our China Study tell you it comes from our China Study tell you it comes from our China Study okay okay okay there's a reference is the publication there's a reference is the publication there's a reference is the publication so now I want to show you something so now I want to show you something so now I want to show you something about this B virus that I find really about this B virus that I find really about this B virus that I find really passionate 1989 8 000 peoples in the Sun passionate 1989 8 000 peoples in the Sun passionate 1989 8 000 peoples in the Sun once again I'm showing your scam ears once again I'm showing your scam ears once again I'm showing your scam ears like I did before more or less the body like I did before more or less the body like I did before more or less the body the information is out there the information is out there the information is out there and uh I mean if the virus is out there and uh I mean if the virus is out there and uh I mean if the virus is out there comes in and remains as an active virus comes in and remains as an active virus comes in and remains as an active virus I'm sorry commotion here I'm sorry commotion here I'm sorry commotion here so sorry about that uh so the the so sorry about that uh so the the so sorry about that uh so the the viruses out there it comes in it's an viruses out there it comes in it's an viruses out there it comes in it's an active virus now it's called an antigen active virus now it's called an antigen active virus now it's called an antigen that's what folks around the body when that's what folks around the body when that's what folks around the body when we test positive as I said before we test positive as I said before we test positive as I said before in the case of of uh Hepatitis B virus in the case of of uh Hepatitis B virus in the case of of uh Hepatitis B virus if it's going to do its damage it's if it's going to do its damage it's if it's going to do its damage it's going to cause liver cancer deaths going to cause liver cancer deaths going to cause liver cancer deaths that's unfortunately cause a decimal that's unfortunately cause a decimal that's unfortunately cause a decimal world I should tell you that's what world I should tell you that's what world I should tell you that's what it's pretty common in Africa and Asia it's pretty common in Africa and Asia it's pretty common in Africa and Asia that that this kind of virus but in any that that this kind of virus but in any that that this kind of virus but in any case case case so we got the virus to come over here we so we got the virus to come over here we so we got the virus to come over here we had data and all this sort of thing it had data and all this sort of thing it had data and all this sort of thing it turns out that we learned from our turns out that we learned from our turns out that we learned from our information that animal food people information that animal food people information that animal food people consuming animal food and World tried consuming animal food and World tried consuming animal food and World tried and was a small amount and was a small amount and was a small amount on average only 10 percent more or less on average only 10 percent more or less on average only 10 percent more or less what we do in the west anyhow people what we do in the west anyhow people what we do in the west anyhow people consuming animal food they were the ones consuming animal food they were the ones consuming animal food they were the ones with the active virus they got infected with the active virus they got infected with the active virus they got infected the virus the virus called the cancer the virus the virus called the cancer the virus the virus called the cancer highly correlated with those two highly correlated with those two highly correlated with those two also at the same time we learned from also at the same time we learned from also at the same time we learned from laboratory studies that the people laboratory studies that the people laboratory studies that the people consuming a little more animal food consuming a little more animal food consuming a little more animal food uh they likely saw a decrease in their uh they likely saw a decrease in their uh they likely saw a decrease in their natural killer cells and I say likely natural killer cells and I say likely natural killer cells and I say likely because we we did a study in some because we we did a study in some because we we did a study in some companion experimental animal studies in companion experimental animal studies in companion experimental animal studies in the lab painting animals that actually the lab painting animals that actually the lab painting animals that actually right in this case mice did give rise to right in this case mice did give rise to right in this case mice did give rise to liver cancer they're called transgenic liver cancer they're called transgenic liver cancer they're called transgenic mice they got the gene woman liver mice they got the gene woman liver mice they got the gene woman liver cancer cancer cancer feed them higher levels of animal feed them higher levels of animal feed them higher levels of animal protein they get to cancer the lower protein they get to cancer the lower protein they get to cancer the lower levels they don't dream very remarkable levels they don't dream very remarkable levels they don't dream very remarkable and it came in the more animal protein and it came in the more animal protein and it came in the more animal protein decreased natural killer cells wow decreased natural killer cells wow decreased natural killer cells wow compromised just like I was explained compromised just like I was explained compromised just like I was explained before plant

tell you really quite Stark and I must tell you really quite Stark and I must tell you that the data we had at this point they that the data we had at this point they that the data we had at this point they were correlations and people like to say were correlations and people like to say were correlations and people like to say oh correlation don't mean Equalization oh correlation don't mean Equalization oh correlation don't mean Equalization this is nonsense in this particular case this is nonsense in this particular case this is nonsense in this particular case that kind of criticism is

but single outcome that's fair enough but I'm not talking about in this case so I'm not talking about in this case so I'm not talking about in this case so for those who think otherwise stop and for those who think otherwise stop and for those who think otherwise stop and think about this we had 11 risk factor think about this we had 11 risk factor think about this we had 11 risk factor correlations associated with the correlations associated with the correlations associated with the presence or the absence of food plant presence or the absence of food plant presence or the absence of food plant food or animal food it turned out and food or animal food it turned out and food or animal food it turned out and I'm only using the the correlations that I'm only using the the correlations that I'm only using the the correlations that Ohio had a significant and 11 of them it Ohio had a significant and 11 of them it Ohio had a significant and 11 of them it turns out those correlations all turns out those correlations all turns out those correlations all converged into the same outcome that I'm converged into the same outcome that I'm converged into the same outcome that I'm describing here describing here describing here animal food causes liver cancer and animal food causes liver cancer and animal food causes liver cancer and death death death plant food and activates the virus to plant food and activates the virus to plant food and activates the virus to form antibodies that was published in a paper that I that was published in a paper that I published

And sure enough, some of get exposed to. And sure enough, some of get exposed to. And sure enough, some of them can in fact sort of initiate them can in fact sort of initiate them can in fact sort of initiate cancer. That's not the issue. But in any cancer. That's not the issue. But in any cancer. That's not the issue. But in any case, that's one way that we tend to case, that's one way that we tend to case, that's one way that we tend to think about the causes of cancer. The think about the causes of cancer. The think about the causes of cancer. The other way to some extent we know of other way to some extent we know of other way to some extent we know of certain viruses that might lead to certain viruses that might lead to certain viruses that might lead to cancer. Things like hepatitis B virus or cancer. Things like hepatitis B virus or cancer. Things like hepatitis B virus or papilloma virus. Maybe you've heard papilloma virus. Maybe you've heard papilloma virus. Maybe you've heard about these causing particular kinds of about these causing particular kinds of about these causing particular kinds of cancers. So those are a couple of kinds cancers. So those are a couple of kinds cancers. So those are a couple of kinds of causes of of causes of of causes of cancer. Thirdly, we tend to think that cancer. Thirdly, we tend to think that cancer. Thirdly, we tend to think that genes cause genes cause genes cause cancer. What that really means in a cancer. What that really means in a cancer. What that really means in a practical sense is that cancer runs in practical sense is that cancer runs in practical sense is that cancer runs in certain families and we have a genetic certain families and we have a genetic certain families and we have a genetic predisposition some of us if you will predisposition some of us if you will predisposition some of us if you will for getting cancer. Those are the three for getting cancer. Those are the three for getting cancer. Those are the three big ticket kind of ideas that most big ticket kind of ideas that most big ticket kind of ideas that most people talked about in science and to people talked about in science and to people talked about in science and to some extent in the public about what some extent in the public about what some extent in the public about what causes cancer. What we were seeing here causes cancer. What we were seeing here causes cancer. What we were seeing here and this I want to go through this and this I want to go through this and this I want to go through this because what we were seeing here was because what we were seeing here was because what we were seeing here was really substantially really substantially really substantially different. What I was seeing I thought different. What I was seeing I thought different. What I was seeing I thought was the idea that simply nutrition the was the idea that simply nutrition the was the idea that simply nutrition the stuff that we regard as important to our stuff that we regard as important to our stuff that we regard as important to our health when done in the wrong way that health when done in the wrong way that health when done in the wrong way that could cause cancer. So that was an could cause cancer. So that was an could cause cancer. So that was an exciting proposition. So you have a exciting proposition. So you have a exciting proposition. So you have a first principle nutrition could turn on first principle nutrition could turn on first principle nutrition could turn on and turn off cancer. You might wonder and turn off cancer. You might wonder and turn off cancer. You might wonder where I'm going with this. where I'm going with this. where I'm going with this. But at the end of the presentation, I But at the end of the presentation, I But at the end of the presentation, I want to I'm going to end up with about want to I'm going to end up with about want to I'm going to end up with about eight principles and it's going to sort eight principles and it's going to sort eight principles and it's going to sort of like be the pillar post of how we of like be the pillar post of how we of like be the pillar post of how we tend to think about science and how that tend to think about science and how that tend to think about science and how that in turn tends to think and shape our way in turn tends to think and shape our way in turn tends to think and shape our way of thinking about nutrition and health. of thinking about nutrition and health. of thinking about nutrition and health. In any case, here's the second one. Uh In any case, here's the second one. Uh In any case, here's the second one. Uh this is a little schematic. This is this is a little schematic. This is this is a little schematic. This is schematic uh simply to illustrate let's schematic uh simply to illustrate let's schematic uh simply to illustrate let's say in this particular case how genes say in this particular case how genes say in this particular case how genes become involved in causing cancer become involved in causing cancer become involved in causing cancer information. what I'm showing here and information. what I'm showing here and information. what I'm showing here and this is just a schematic in this this is just a schematic in this this is just a schematic in this particular case here we've got some particular case here we've got some particular case here we've got some normal cells let's normal cells let's normal cells let's say on one hand if we let's say mutate say on one hand if we let's say mutate say on one hand if we let's say mutate some of these cells to create more some of these cells to create more some of these cells to create more cancer cancer cancer genes as you can see here with a red genes as you can see here with a red genes as you can see here with a red sort of little cells over here we'll sort of little cells over here we'll sort of little cells over here we'll take we'll do for comparison another take we'll do for comparison another take we'll do for comparison another sort of experiment where we create less sort of experiment where we create less sort of experiment where we create less cancer genes so we get two sort of cancer genes so we get two sort of cancer genes so we get two sort of situations here one situation with a lot situations here one situation with a lot situations here one situation with a lot of cancer genes the other with much of cancer genes the other with much of cancer genes the other with much less. Now from that point onwards in less. Now from that point onwards in less. Now from that point onwards in theory and to some extent in practice if theory and to some extent in practice if theory and to some extent in practice if the nutrition stays the the nutrition stays the the nutrition stays the same obviously the animals starting out same obviously the animals starting out same obviously the animals starting out or the or the or the people if if those of us who have more people if if those of us who have more people if if those of us who have more cancer genes and we do the same kind cancer genes and we do the same kind cancer genes and we do the same kind let's say in theory do the same kind of let's say in theory do the same kind of let's say in theory do the same kind of nutrition we get more tumors that is nutrition we get more tumors that is nutrition we get more tumors that is fair enough to say that genes cause fair enough to say that genes cause fair enough to say that genes cause cancer more cancer over here less over cancer more cancer over here less over cancer more cancer over here less over here so genes cause cancer here so genes cause cancer here so genes cause cancer That's a popular idea. We think genes That's a popular idea. We think genes That's a popular idea. We think genes cause cancer. I must tell you everything cause cancer. I must tell you everything cause cancer. I must tell you everything actually whether it's cancer or other actually whether it's cancer or other actually whether it's cancer or other diseases or good things, good health. diseases or good things, good health. diseases or good things, good health. Everything starts from a genetic basis. Everything starts from a genetic basis. Everything starts from a genetic basis. That's the first step. So we get all That's the first step. So we get all That's the first step. So we get all kinds of genes to do all kinds of kinds of genes to do all kinds of kinds of genes to do all kinds of things, good things, bad things if you things, good things, bad things if you things, good things, bad things if you will. So genes are the starting place will. So genes are the starting place will. So genes are the starting place and it's reasonable to assume therefore and it's reasonable to assume therefore and it's reasonable to assume therefore they are a cause. However, look at this. they are a cause. However, look at this. they are a cause. However, look at this. when in this particular kind of scheme when in this particular kind of scheme when in this particular kind of scheme and this is what we basically did. Uh in and this is what we basically did. Uh in and this is what we basically did. Uh in any case here in this particular case any case here in this particular case any case here in this particular case here these animals are destined to get here these animals are destined to get here these animals are destined to get more tumors these over here less but in more tumors these over here less but in more tumors these over here less but in fact if these in this particular case fact if these in this particular case fact if these in this particular case here are given low protein they get the here are given low protein they get the here are given low protein they get the less. So in other words whereas we may less. So in other words whereas we may less. So in other words whereas we may have assumed that genes are so important have assumed that genes are so important have assumed that genes are so important and how much you know altered genes we and how much you know altered genes we and how much you know altered genes we may have in the beginning what really may have in the beginning what really may have in the beginning what really matters is what we subsequently do with matters is what we subsequently do with matters is what we subsequently do with those genes. And so nutrition controls those genes. And so nutrition controls those genes. And so nutrition controls how genes behave. Very important how genes behave. Very important how genes behave. Very important principle. A very important principle principle. A very important principle principle. A very important principle has major implications for thinking has major implications for thinking has major implications for thinking about all kinds of things. So principle about all kinds of things. So principle about all kinds of things. So principle number two, nutrition cults genes which number two, nutrition cults genes which number two, nutrition cults genes which in turn control cancer. In cancer. In addition, then we I began to ask the addition, then we I began to ask the addition, then we I began to ask the question, I didn't pay a lot of question, I didn't pay a lot of question, I didn't pay a lot of attention to this in the beginning to attention to this in the beginning to attention to this in the beginning to start to ask the question, what about start to ask the question, what about start to ask the question, what about this protein that actually is this protein that actually is this protein that actually is controlling cancer growth? What is this controlling cancer growth? What is this controlling cancer growth? What is this protein we're using? Well, it turns out protein we're using? Well, it turns out protein we're using? Well, it turns out we were just simply using the protein we were just simply using the protein we were just simply using the protein that was available in the marketplace at that was available in the marketplace at that was available in the marketplace at the time that researchers tend to use, the time that researchers tend to use, the time that researchers tend to use, one readily available. It actually turns one readily available. It actually turns one readily available. It actually turns out to be cow's milk protein. out to be cow's milk protein. out to be cow's milk protein. So um that's basically casein So um that's basically casein So um that's basically casein representing 87% approximately of total representing 87% approximately of total representing 87% approximately of total protein in cow's milk. That's what was protein in cow's milk. That's what was protein in cow's milk. That's what was turning on in fact the cancer. So we turning on in fact the cancer. So we turning on in fact the cancer. So we said okay what happens if we try a said okay what happens if we try a said okay what happens if we try a couple of plant proteins in this model. couple of plant proteins in this model. couple of plant proteins in this model. It turned out when we tried soy protein It turned out when we tried soy protein It turned out when we tried soy protein and wheat protein even when fed at the and wheat protein even when fed at the and wheat protein even when fed at the high levels the 20% of total high levels the 20% of total high levels the 20% of total incidentally that 20% of protein in the incidentally that 20% of protein in the incidentally that 20% of protein in the diet was the amount more or less diet was the amount more or less diet was the amount more or less recommended. This is going to come back recommended. This is going to come back recommended. This is going to come back to be equivalent to what we do as humans to be equivalent to what we do as humans to be equivalent to what we do as humans too but for for just for the moment. But too but for for just for the moment. But too but for for just for the moment. But in any case soy protein we protein even in any case soy protein we protein even in any case soy protein we protein even when fed at the higher levels did not in when fed at the higher levels did not in when fed at the higher levels did not in fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was all of a sudden an idea that was all of a sudden an idea that was all of a sudden an idea that was beginning to arise. Not enough beginning to arise. Not enough beginning to arise. Not enough information I can assure you, but it's information I can assure you, but it's information I can assure you, but it's certainly quite provocative in the in certainly quite provocative in the in certainly quite provocative in the in the different ways that these kinds of the different ways that these kinds of the different ways that these kinds of proteins proteins proteins behaved. So we had a principle here in behaved. So we had a principle here in behaved. So we had a principle here in my view, namely that nutrients of my view, namely that nutrients of my view, namely that nutrients of animal-based foods function differently animal-based foods function differently animal-based foods function differently from nutrients in plant-based foods. Now from nutrients in plant-based foods. Now from nutrients in plant-based foods. Now that's a big statement there to make that's a big statement there to make that's a big statement there to make with so little information. that with so little information. that with so little information. that information were provocative, yes, but information were provocative, yes, but information were provocative, yes, but in order to get really to that in order to get really to that in order to get really to that principle, we'd have to do a lot more. principle, we'd have to do a lot more. principle, we'd have to do a lot more. And we did do a lot more. We looked at And we did do a lot more. We looked at And we did do a lot more. We looked at things like pancreatic cancer, memory things like pancreatic cancer, memory things like pancreatic cancer, memory cancer, and different kinds of ways. We cancer, and different kinds of ways. We cancer, and different kinds of ways. We looked at other kinds of nutrients, not looked at other kinds of nutrients, not looked at other kinds of nutrients, not just protein. So, that statement there just protein. So, that statement there just protein. So, that statement there is based not on what I just showed you. is based not on what I just showed you. is based not on what I just showed you. It's actually based on comparing It's actually based on comparing It's actually based on comparing nutrients from plants and nutrients from nutrients from plants and nutrients from nutrients from plants and nutrients from animal foods and having a look to see animal foods and having a look to see animal foods and having a look to see what they did with respect to cancer what they did with respect to cancer what they did with respect to cancer which in turn leads us to that which in turn leads us to that which in turn leads us to that principle. principle. principle. Incidentally, one of the I one of the Incidentally, one of the I one of the Incidentally, one of the I one of the reasons I like to talk about reasons I like to talk about reasons I like to talk about principles that gets around that really principles that gets around that really principles that gets around that really gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning whether or not you're doing experiments whether or not you're doing experiments whether or not you're doing experiments in the in the in the laboratory with experimental animals, laboratory with experimental animals, laboratory with experimental animals, which I don't really support anymore, which I don't really support anymore, which I don't really support anymore, but that's the way we all did it. It but that's the way we all did it. It but that's the way we all did it. It gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning whether or not that information whether or not that information whether or not that information experimental animal situation is experimental animal situation is experimental animal situation is applicable to humans. Because when we applicable to humans. Because when we applicable to humans. Because when we discover principle, I'm talking about a discover principle, I'm talking about a discover principle, I'm talking about a principle of biology, a principle of principle of biology, a principle of principle of biology, a principle of mamalian biology in particular that mamalian biology in particular that mamalian biology in particular that applies to regardless of let's say age applies to regardless of let's say age applies to regardless of let's say age or gender or species if you will that's or gender or species if you will that's or gender or species if you will that's what I mean by principle something what I mean by principle something what I mean by principle something really really fundamental you know for really really fundamental you know for really really fundamental you know for our thinking okay so anyhow this is our thinking okay so anyhow this is our thinking okay so anyhow this is principle number three nutrients of principle number three nutrients of principle number three nutrients of animal-based foods you know many done animal-based foods you know many done animal-based foods you know many done different ways actually behave different ways actually behave different ways actually behave differently from plant-based foods That differently from plant-based foods That differently from plant-based foods That was one of the first inklings I really was one of the first inklings I really was one of the first inklings I really started to get. There's something here started to get. There's something here started to get. There's something here with respect to our revered animal foods with respect to our revered animal foods with respect to our revered animal foods on the one hand and possibly plant foods on the one hand and possibly plant foods on the one hand and possibly plant foods on the other. So as a sidebar I don't count this as an So as a sidebar I don't count this as an altogether new principle but it's altogether new principle but it's altogether new principle but it's another way of interpreting this and another way of interpreting this and another way of interpreting this and this was really provocative and that was this was really provocative and that was this was really provocative and that was the idea that casing itself is the most the idea that casing itself is the most the idea that casing itself is the most relevant chemical carcinogen ever tested relevant chemical carcinogen ever tested relevant chemical carcinogen ever tested if you don't recognize that I mean that if you don't recognize that I mean that if you don't recognize that I mean that was about as provocative as I I can was about as provocative as I I can was about as provocative as I I can assure you that one could ever imagine assure you that one could ever imagine assure you that one could ever imagine the most revered of all the most revered of all the most revered of all nutrients animal-based protein if you nutrients animal-based protein if you nutrients animal-based protein if you will if I can say that causing the most will if I can say that causing the most will if I can say that causing the most uh most serious of all diseases cancer I uh most serious of all diseases cancer I uh most serious of all diseases cancer I mean we're just having really a clashing mean we're just having really a clashing mean we're just having really a clashing of of ideas here I took that idea of of ideas here I took that idea of of ideas here I took that idea actually we did that research in actually we did that research in actually we did that research in different ways I took it to the three different ways I took it to the three different ways I took it to the three major laboratories in the world two in major laboratories in the world two in major laboratories in the world two in the United States one in the United the United States one in the United the United States one in the United Nations and made the presentation to Nations and made the presentation to Nations and made the presentation to those who are doing this kind of those who are doing this kind of those who are doing this kind of research on chemical carcinia made by research on chemical carcinia made by research on chemical carcinia made by presentations to them because I wanted presentations to them because I wanted presentations to them because I wanted to get the critique for those who would to get the critique for those who would to get the critique for those who would most likely most likely most likely disagree. I really didn't get disagree. I really didn't get disagree. I really didn't get disagreement. It was so provocative. I disagreement. It was so provocative. I disagreement. It was so provocative. I was told, \"You'll never tell that.\" In was told, \"You'll never tell that.\" In was told, \"You'll never tell that.\" In one case, when I was in North Carolina one case, when I was in North Carolina one case, when I was in North Carolina talking to a National Institutes of talking to a National Institutes of talking to a National Institutes of Health research group, uh they Health research group, uh they Health research group, uh they concluded, \"Yes, you're doing the right concluded, \"Yes, you're doing the right concluded, \"Yes, you're doing the right thing.

research research research uh directed to improving the production uh directed to improving the production uh directed to improving the production of protein of protein of protein down in the philippines so it's all down in the philippines so it's all down in the philippines so it's all about protein the more the better about protein the more the better about protein the more the better and i think many of you can identify and i think many of you can identify and i think many of you can identify with that how many of you have sort of with that how many of you have sort of with that how many of you have sort of gotten into this business gotten into this business gotten into this business and your friends ask you where you get and your friends ask you where you get and your friends ask you where you get your protein from your protein from your protein from you know this idea still hangs around so you know this idea still hangs around so you know this idea still hangs around so i want to develop i want to develop i want to develop work on that theme a bit so now work on that theme a bit so now work on that theme a bit so now i'm in the philippines um i i'm in the philippines um i i'm in the philippines um i was aware we're supposed to get more was aware we're supposed to get more was aware we're supposed to get more protein i can't get all the details on protein i can't get all the details on protein i can't get all the details on that particular point of view that particular point of view that particular point of view but about that time of this study came but about that time of this study came but about that time of this study came out in india out in india out in india showing that in experimental animals in showing that in experimental animals in showing that in experimental animals in this case rats this case rats this case rats that when these rats are exposed to a that when these rats are exposed to a that when these rats are exposed to a carcinogen that gives rise to liver carcinogen that gives rise to liver carcinogen that gives rise to liver cancer cancer cancer okay it starts out you know they're okay it starts out you know they're okay it starts out you know they're exposed to a carcinogen it gives rise to exposed to a carcinogen it gives rise to exposed to a carcinogen it gives rise to liver cancer liver cancer liver cancer if they are fed a couple levels of if they are fed a couple levels of if they are fed a couple levels of protein high and low protein high and low protein high and low that their thesis was or hypothesis was that their thesis was or hypothesis was that their thesis was or hypothesis was that the animals given the higher levels that the animals given the higher levels that the animals given the higher levels of protein would get less cancer of protein would get less cancer of protein would get less cancer such was the importance of protein it such was the importance of protein it such was the importance of protein it does you know does everything if we does you know does everything if we does you know does everything if we could just get more could just get more could just get more protein consumed we could have less protein consumed we could have less protein consumed we could have less cancer that was our idea cancer that was our idea cancer that was our idea as you can see here the opposite as you can see here the opposite as you can see here the opposite appeared appeared appeared the opposite appeared they they couldn't the opposite appeared they they couldn't the opposite appeared they they couldn't even go along with their own results even go along with their own results even go along with their own results quite frankly they went back and redid quite frankly

reverse and attempting to show it was a reverse and attempting to show it was a reverse i had a chance to go to india about 25 i had a chance to go to india about 25 i had a chance to go to india about 25 years after that years after that years after that to talk about the fact that i didn't see to talk about the fact that i didn't see to talk about the fact that i didn't see it that way it that way it that way that the animals given the highest that the animals given the highest that the animals given the highest protein levels protein levels protein levels got a hundred percent small study got a hundred percent small study got a hundred percent small study hundred percent got the liver tumors hundred percent got the liver tumors hundred percent got the liver tumors and the ones that fed five percent none and the ones that fed five percent none and the ones that fed five percent none did that was striking did that was striking did that was striking increasing protein increasing cancer how increasing protein increasing cancer how increasing protein increasing cancer how do you like that do you like that do you like that so i mean there's someone wearing just so i mean there's someone wearing just so i mean there's someone wearing just two hats and essentially i'm interested two hats and essentially i'm interested two hats and essentially i'm interested in the science i want to in the science i want to in the science i want to i want to deal with the facts but on the i want to deal with the facts but on the i want to deal with the facts but on the other hand we're all worshiping protein other hand we're all worshiping protein other hand we're all worshiping protein if you will if you will if you will and somebody somehow like this this and somebody somehow like this this and somebody somehow like this this comes along as soon as shakes the comes along as soon as shakes the comes along as soon as shakes the shakes the bushes a bit so came home shakes the bushes a bit so came home shakes the bushes a bit so came home got a grant it lasted for the next 27 got a grant it lasted for the next 27 got a grant it lasted for the next 27 years and i really wanted to know years and i really wanted to know years and i really wanted to know you know is that really true and if this you know is that really true and if this you know is that really true and if this is true how does it work what's the what is true how does it work what's the what is true how does it work what's the what we call we call we call mechanisms so here's a little chart mechanisms so here's a little chart mechanisms so here's a little chart showing showing showing the first 12 weeks as the cancers are the first 12 weeks as the cancers are the first 12 weeks as the cancers are growing growing growing i mean all cancers start with a mutation i mean all cancers start with a mutation i mean all cancers start with a mutation with a mutated gene with a mutated gene with a mutated gene so they're supposed to incarcerate that so they're supposed to incarcerate that so they're supposed to incarcerate that mutant cause a mutation mutant cause a mutation mutant cause a mutation okay then if that twenty percent of five okay then if that twenty percent of five okay then if that twenty percent of five percent just like the indian workers did percent just like the indian workers did percent just like the indian workers did you can see the difference is huge it's you can see the difference is huge it's you can see the difference is huge it's huge huge huge once but twenty percent they're all once but twenty percent they're all once but twenty percent they're all getting cancer it's going fast getting cancer it's going fast getting cancer it's going fast this is just for during the first three this is just for during the first three this is just for during the first three months which is you know quite a long months which is you know quite a long months which is you know quite a long time time time for a rat but here here's here's i want for a rat but here here's here's i want for a rat but here here's here's i want to show you this because something came to show you this because something came to show you this because something came up up up this wasn't exactly done in this order this wasn't exactly done in this order this wasn't exactly done in this order but here's what happened but here's what happened but here's what happened i was curious about this idea that i was curious about this idea that i was curious about this idea that cancer is caused by genes cancer is caused by genes cancer is caused by genes namely mutations and mutations for those namely mutations and mutations for those namely mutations and mutations for those of you not familiar with this of you not familiar with this of you not familiar with this our genes are mutated by chemical our genes are mutated by chemical our genes are mutated by chemical carcinogens they're changed carcinogens they're changed carcinogens they're changed so that now the new gene if it's not so that now the new gene if it's not so that now the new gene if it's not repaired then becomes the basis for repaired then becomes the basis for repaired then becomes the basis for cancers to grow i wanted to know in this cancers to grow i wanted to know in this cancers to grow i wanted to know in this particular case particular case particular case whether let's say after two and a half whether let's say after two and a half whether let's say after two and a half months months months they got the exposure of the carcinogen they got the exposure of the carcinogen they got the exposure of the carcinogen at that time you think you would think at that time you think you would think at that time you think you would think that that that all the mutations are well reversed all the mutations are well reversed all the mutations are well reversed right or they're gone or the right or they're gone or the right or they're gone or the cortisone is not there we fed them 20 cortisone is not there we fed them 20 cortisone is not there we fed them 20 protein protein protein and lo and behold what it showed was and lo and behold what it showed was and lo and behold what it showed was we saw a tumor response after we saw a tumor response after we saw a tumor response after one would have thought those genes are one would have thought those genes are one would have thought those genes are gone gone gone no they were still there kind of hanging no they were still there kind of hanging no they were still there kind of hanging around that led to a major consideration around that led to a major consideration around that led to a major consideration that over the years it turns out that that over the years it turns out that that over the years it turns out that cancer in this case here suggest that cancer in this case here suggest that cancer in this case here suggest that cancer doesn't form as a cancer doesn't form as a cancer doesn't form as a result of the gene or the mutation it result of the gene or the mutation it result of the gene or the mutation it focuses primarily as in this case at focuses primarily as in this case at focuses primarily as in this case at least least least as a function of nutrition very as a function of nutrition very as a function of nutrition very different so here's another way to look different so here's another way to look different so here's another way to look at the same thing at the same thing at the same thing i ended up with with a number of ideas i ended up with with a number of ideas i ended up with with a number of ideas that now since have become very that now since have become very that now since have become very provocative even more provocative provocative even more provocative provocative even more provocative in the sense that it tends to challenge in the sense that it tends to challenge in the sense that it tends to challenge the way we think or the way the way we think or the way the way we think or the way we do things so here's my first we do things so here's my first we do things so here's my first challenge challenge challenge cancer begins with a mutated gene that cancer begins with a mutated gene that cancer begins with a mutated gene that may lie dormant may lie dormant may lie dormant until developed by major by nutrition until developed by major by nutrition until developed by major by nutrition not by genes not by genes not by genes just think about that we all have some just think about that we all have some just think about that we all have some genes that could give rise to cancer we genes that could give rise to cancer we genes that could give rise to cancer we have the seeds if you will and when the have the seeds if you will and when the have the seeds if you will and when the reason reason reason for the most part not to oversimplify for the most part not to oversimplify for the most part not to oversimplify the reason we tend to get cancer the reason we tend to get cancer the reason we tend to get cancer is because we're feeding the wrong is because we're feeding the wrong is because we're feeding the wrong nutrition to those genes so nutrition to those genes so nutrition to those genes so they come up and they form cancer here's they come up and they form cancer here's they come up and they form cancer here's another way to look at this another way to look at this another way to look at this same basis i showed before i wanted to same basis i showed before i wanted to same basis i showed before i wanted to know in this particular case know in this particular case know in this particular case what happens if we change the diet from what happens if we change the diet from what happens if we change the diet from twenty to five percent or five percent twenty to five percent or five percent twenty to five percent or five percent to twenty percent if you will to twenty percent if you will to twenty percent if you will here's the results we got first three here's the results we got first three here's the results we got first three weeks these early cancer growing in weeks these early cancer growing in weeks these early cancer growing in response to 20 response to 20 response to 20 turned off for the next three weeks turned off for the next three weeks turned off for the next three weeks turned back on turned off to me that was turned back on turned off to me that was turned back on turned off to me that was really a really a really a spectacular sort of thing the idea that spectacular sort of thing the idea that spectacular sort of thing the idea that we could take nutrition we could take nutrition we could take nutrition right within normal levels of right within normal levels of right within normal levels of consumption more or less consumption more or less consumption more or less and adjust it adjust the amount being and adjust it adjust the amount being and adjust it adjust the amount being consumed and actually change the course consumed and actually change the course consumed and actually change the course of the development of the disease that of the development of the disease that of the development of the disease that was was was very exciting so in a sense we're very exciting so in a sense we're very exciting so in a sense we're turning on to turn off cancer turning on to turn off cancer turning on to turn off cancer [Music]",

our quick fire round of questions from our quick fire round of questions from our listeners and just to remind you listeners and just to remind you listeners and just to remind you Christopher you know the rules are are Christopher you know the rules are are Christopher you know the rules are are quite simple you can say yes you can say quite simple you can say yes you can say quite simple you can say yes you can say no or if you have to you're allowed a no or if you have to you're allowed a no or if you have to you're allowed a one sentence answer one sentence answer one sentence answer but no more than that and we know that but no more than that and we know that but no more than that and we know that this is the hardest thing for any this is the hardest thing for any this is the hardest thing for any Professor to do but are you willing to Professor to do but are you willing to Professor to do but are you willing to give it a go yes give it a go yes give it a go yes all right you've got the hang of it all right you've got the hang of it all right you've got the hang of it already yes already yes already yes okay Christopher will I die if I don't okay Christopher will I die if I don't okay Christopher will I die if I don't get any protein in my food yes get any protein in my food yes get any protein in my food yes do animals contain special proteins that do animals contain special proteins that do animals contain special proteins that you can't get from Plants now should we you can't get from Plants now should we you can't get from Plants now should we all be worrying about getting enough all be worrying about getting enough all be worrying about getting enough protein no protein no protein no are protein shakes and protein bars are protein shakes and protein bars are protein shakes and protein bars healthy for most people healthy for most people healthy for most people compared to a tablespoon of sugar compared to a tablespoon of sugar compared to a tablespoon of sugar healthier but I always think compared to healthier but I always think compared to healthier but I always think compared to what compared to food what compared to food what compared to food no no no I told you it was hard for a professor I told you it was hard for a professor I told you it was hard for a professor to answer these questions to answer these questions to answer these questions and the last question can eating more and the last question can eating more and the last question can eating more protein help with weight loss no okay I think a lot of people are no okay I think a lot of people are already going to be surprised and I hope already going to be surprised and I hope already going to be surprised and I hope we're now going to unpack this uh in the we're now going to unpack this uh in the we're now going to unpack this uh in the rest of the podcast maybe we can just rest of the podcast maybe we can just rest of the podcast maybe we can just start at the very beginning so I think start at the very beginning so I think start at the very beginning so I think most of our listeners will feel they most of our listeners will feel they most of our listeners will feel they know what a fat is right they're know what a fat is right they're know what a fat is right they're thinking of like an oil they cook with thinking of like an oil they cook with thinking of like an oil they cook with or butter or you know maybe the fat in a or butter or you know maybe the fat in a or butter or you know maybe the fat in a piece of meat and I think almost piece of meat and I think almost piece of meat and I think almost everybody feels sort of confident about everybody feels sort of confident about everybody feels sort of confident about a carb right it's like it's bread or a carb right it's like it's bread or a carb right it's like it's bread or potatoes or something like that I think potatoes or something like that I think potatoes or something like that I think however if a lot of people are like me however if a lot of people are like me however if a lot of people are like me they're actually quite unclear really they're actually quite unclear really they're actually quite unclear really what protein is except you know they're what protein is except you know they're what protein is except you know they're sure there's quite a lot of it and a sure there's quite a lot of it and a sure there's quite a lot of it and a piece of meat because you know their mum piece of meat because you know their mum piece of meat because you know their mum always said you know eat your meat and always said you know eat your meat and always said you know eat your meat and get your protein so could you just sort get your protein so could you just sort get your protein so could you just sort of start at the beginning what is of start at the beginning what is of start at the beginning what is protein and why do we need it protein and why do we need it protein and why do we need it sure so when it comes to fat and carb sure so when it comes to fat and carb sure so when it comes to fat and carb that's really most of our fuel that's really most of our fuel that's really most of our fuel when it comes to protein it's more of when it comes to protein it's more of when it comes to protein it's more of our structure our structure our structure so all of our cells and our organs and so all of our cells and our organs and so all of our cells and our organs and our hair and our fingernails all of that our hair and our fingernails all of that our hair and our fingernails all of that is structural protein is structural protein is structural protein all the enzymes that are in our body all the enzymes that are in our body all the enzymes that are in our body that catalyze reactions and make that catalyze reactions and make that catalyze reactions and make metabolism move forward those are all metabolism move forward those are all metabolism move forward those are all proteins many hormones proteins many hormones proteins many hormones our proteins there's actually a huge our proteins there's actually a huge our proteins there's actually a huge list of functional things list of functional things list of functional things that proteins do that proteins do that proteins do and to take it to one next level maybe and to take it to one next level maybe and to take it to one next level maybe this is helpful maybe this is not all this is helpful maybe this is not all this is helpful maybe this is not all proteins are made of 20 amino acids in proteins are made of 20 amino acids in proteins are made of 20 amino acids in the human body and I like to think of the human body and I like to think of the human body and I like to think of them like Scrabble letters in the them like Scrabble letters in the them like Scrabble letters in the Scrabble board game or the letter Scrabble board game or the letter Scrabble board game or the letter somebody would put on the Marquee of a somebody would put on the Marquee of a somebody would put on the Marquee of a movie theater and for perspective movie theater and for perspective movie theater and for perspective there's a couple of them that are only there's a couple of them that are only there's a couple of them that are only three amino acids tied together which three amino acids tied together which three amino acids tied together which would be called a tripeptide but that would be called a tripeptide but that would be called a tripeptide but that would be unusual would be unusual would be unusual the largest one I know of is something the largest one I know of is something the largest one I know of is something called maybe Tin Tin 35 called maybe Tin Tin 35 called maybe Tin Tin 35 000 amino acids strung together 000 amino acids strung together 000 amino acids strung together I was thinking about this like words and I was thinking about this like words and I was thinking about this like words and these amino acids like letters but these amino acids like letters but these amino acids like letters but you're saying these words can get really you're saying these words can get really you're saying these words can get really long and you need a lot of them but long and you need a lot of them but long and you need a lot of them but fundamentally you can make any word like fundamentally you can make any word like fundamentally you can make any word like any protein out of just this limited any protein out of just this limited any protein out of just this limited number of these uh these amino acids one number of these uh these amino acids one number of these uh these amino acids one could be a limerick you know and one could be a limerick you know and one could be a limerick you know and one could be a haiku it's just amazing how could be a haiku it's just amazing how could be a haiku it's just amazing how they differ in length and what's they differ in length and what's they differ in length and what's critical is not only that the specific critical is not only that the specific critical is not only that the specific amino acids one after another be perfect amino acids one after another be perfect amino acids one after another be perfect like if you were spell checking your like if you were spell checking your like if you were spell checking your your writing in a document and say nope your writing in a document and say nope your writing in a document and say nope that word doesn't work so it has to be that word doesn't work so it has to be that word doesn't work so it has to be perfect and then when the amino acids perfect and then when the amino acids perfect and then when the amino acids are arranged in a certain configuration are arranged in a certain configuration are arranged in a certain configuration these long strings of amino acids uh these long strings of amino acids uh these long strings of amino acids uh twirl and twist and conform they twirl and twist and conform they twirl and twist and conform they actually have to be side by side in just actually have to be side by side in just actually have to be side by side in just the right way and if you change that and the right way and if you change that and the right way and if you change that and unravel them which happens in your unravel them which happens in your unravel them which happens in your stomach with a low ph stomach with a low ph stomach with a low ph it happens with heat it happens with heat it happens with heat you inactivate the protein and if it was you inactivate the protein and if it was you inactivate the protein and if it was going to have some functional purpose going to have some functional purpose going to have some functional purpose like an enzyme or a hormone like an enzyme or a hormone like an enzyme or a hormone it no longer works and now it's kind of it no longer works and now it's kind of it no longer works and now it's kind of just like fuel now you can just break just like fuel now you can just break just like fuel now you can just break apart the single amino acids and use apart the single amino acids and use apart the single amino acids and use them but it can't function like it was them but it can't function like it was them but it can't function like it was going to and that's why protein's so going to and that's why protein's so going to and that's why protein's so tricky so many things that it does so tricky so many things that it does so tricky so many things that it does so many ways to activate and inactivate it many ways to activate and inactivate it many ways to activate and inactivate it and so Christopher to make sure that and so Christopher to make sure that and so Christopher to make sure that I've got this because that was a little I've got this because that was a little I've got this because that was a little scary what you just described you're scary what you just described you're scary what you just described you're basically saying you know we basically saying you know we basically saying you know we eat food with proteins in it we break it eat food with proteins in it we break it eat food with proteins in it we break it down there are like 20 of the potential down there are like 20 of the potential down there are like 20 of the potential like building blocks like letters which like building blocks like letters which like building blocks like letters which is what you're calling these amino acids is what you're calling these amino acids is what you're calling these amino acids and then our body makes almost and then our body makes almost and then our body makes almost everything we're made of out of those everything we're made of out of those everything we're made of out of those like 20 letters in unimaginably complex like 20 letters in unimaginably complex like 20 letters in unimaginably complex sort of combinations sort of combinations sort of combinations I like the way you said that and let me I like the way you said that and let me I like the way you said that and let me add one twist to this which is pretty add one twist to this which is pretty add one twist to this which is pretty interesting there's very few rare interesting there's very few rare interesting there's very few rare exceptions to this but when you say eat exceptions to this but when you say eat exceptions to this but when you say eat an animal protein or a plant protein and an animal protein or a plant protein and an animal protein or a plant protein and it goes into your digestive tract you it goes into your digestive tract you it goes into your digestive tract you can't absorb those amino acids into your can't absorb those amino acids into your can't absorb those amino acids into your body until you break them down to their body until you break them down to their body until you break them down to their single amino acid levels and then you single amino acid levels and then you single amino acid levels and then you absorb them travels through your body absorb them travels through your body absorb them travels through your body reassembles them can't remember where it reassembles them can't remember where it reassembles them can't remember where it came from oh did this come from a cow oh came from oh did this come

like ah come from broccoli no clue it's like ah come from broccoli no clue it's like ah it's just this amino acid I don't even it's just this amino acid I don't even it's just this amino acid I don't even care it came from a supplement care it came from a supplement care it came from a supplement can't even tell it's just the building can't even tell it's just the building can't even tell it's just the building block block block got it so this is like I uh I ate got it so this is like I uh I ate got it so this is like I uh I ate Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my Shakespeare or I ate a comic book my body just breaks it down to letters that body just breaks it down to letters that body just breaks it down to letters that just makes the protein sound even more just makes the protein sound even more just makes the protein sound even more important important important um I guess um I guess um I guess follow-on natural question about this is follow-on natural question about this is follow-on natural question about this is I think one of the things that we've I think one of the things that we've I think one of the things that we've learned on this podcast is that our body learned on this podcast is that our body learned on this podcast is that our body has this amazing ability often to swap has this amazing ability often to swap has this amazing ability often to swap carbs into fat so it doesn't really carbs into fat so it doesn't really carbs into fat so it doesn't really matter what you eat always because your matter what you eat always because your matter what you eat always because your body will make what you need can't we body will make what you need can't we body will make what you need can't we just make these letters these amino just make these letters these amino just make these letters these amino acids when we need them yeah I bet you a acids when we need them yeah I bet you a acids when we need them yeah I bet you a lot of people listening have heard of lot of people listening have heard of lot of people listening have heard of essential and non-essential amino acids essential and non-essential amino acids essential and non-essential amino acids I think it's a pretty non-essential I think it's a pretty non-essential I think it's a pretty non-essential question for all of your listeners but question for all of your listeners but question for all of your listeners but I'm going to say it anyway the I the I'm going to say it anyway the I the I'm going to say it anyway the I the ideas ideas ideas um while carbohydrates and fats are um while carbohydrates and fats are um while carbohydrates and fats are circulating in your body those the basic circulating in your body those the basic circulating in your body those the basic structure of those is is built on structure of those is is built on structure of those is is built on carbons of different lengths and they carbons of different lengths and they carbons of different lengths and they have very complex metabolic pathways and have very complex metabolic pathways and have very complex metabolic pathways and at certain points in carbohydrate at certain points in carbohydrate at certain points in carbohydrate metabolism and fat metabolism you can metabolism and fat metabolism you can metabolism and fat metabolism you can borrow one of these molecules put a borrow one of these molecules put a borrow one of these molecules put a nitrogen on it in the form of an amino nitrogen on it in the form of an amino nitrogen on it in the form of an amino group which means a nitrogen with three group which means a nitrogen with three group which means a nitrogen with three hydrogens hydrogens hydrogens an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen an amino Amino reflects this nitrogen portion you can actually make 11 of the portion you can actually make 11 of the portion you can actually make 11 of the amino acids amino acids amino acids by borrowing something from fat and carb by borrowing something from fat and carb by borrowing something from fat and carb and putting this ammonia amine group on and putting this ammonia amine group on and putting this ammonia amine group on it and likewise if you were breaking it and likewise if you were breaking it and likewise if you were breaking protein down because you had enough for protein down because you had enough for protein down because you had enough for the day which I hope we get to later the day which I hope we get to later the day which I hope we get to later because most people eat more than enough because most people eat more than enough because most people eat more than enough if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen if you take the amine ammonia nitrogen group off you can put it right back into group off you can put it right back into group off you can put it right back into the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing the carbohydrate or the fat metabolizing chain and that works for 11 amino acids chain and that works for 11 amino acids chain and that works for 11 amino acids for nine of them there isn't a specific for nine of them there isn't a specific for nine of them there isn't a specific place you can borrow it from in your place you can borrow it from in your place you can borrow it from in your body and so you since you need all 20 body and so you since you need all 20 body and so you since you need all 20 for just about every single protein that for just about every single protein that for just about every single protein that you synthesize you also have to get the you synthesize you also have to get the you synthesize you also have to get the nine essential ones and essential simply nine essential ones and essential simply nine essential ones and essential simply means you can't assemble the whole thing means you can't assemble the whole thing means you can't assemble the whole thing yourself you got to make sure I got that yourself you got to make sure I got that yourself you got to make sure I got that Christopher because it got a bit scary Christopher because it got a bit scary Christopher because it got a bit scary in chemistry again in chemistry again in chemistry again um you're saying there are these 20 um you're saying there are these 20 um you're saying there are these 20 actually we can make some of them actually we can make some of them actually we can make some of them ourselves but actually like I think you ourselves but actually like I think you ourselves but actually like I think you would say nine of them we can't make would say nine of them we can't make would say nine of them we can't make them so you've got to eat them you have them so you've got to eat them you have them so you've got to eat them you have to get those nine in order to do you to get those nine in order to do you to get those nine in order to do you know essential things inside yourself is know essential things inside yourself is know essential things inside yourself is that that that all right so protein is really important all right so protein is really important all right so protein is really important we need to get some we need to get some we need to get some um um um let's talk about how much we therefore let's talk about how much we therefore let's talk about how much we therefore need which was the number one question need which was the number one question need which was the number one question that we had as we were preparing for that we had as we were preparing for that we had as we were preparing for this show this show this show okay uh you're gonna just have to stop okay uh you're gonna just have to stop okay uh you're gonna just have to stop me all over the place and get me to me all over the place and get me to me all over the place and get me to explain it in English because this will explain it in English because this will explain it in English because this will be harder but uh basically you I'm going be harder but uh basically you I'm going be harder but uh basically you I'm going to take one big step back and say if to take one big step back and say if to take one big step back and say if you've eaten enough calories for the day you've eaten enough calories for the day you've eaten enough calories for the day you've got enough protein you've got enough protein you've got enough protein just so stop just so stop just so stop obsessing about protein proteins and obsessing about protein proteins and obsessing about protein proteins and everything all 20 amino acids are in all everything all 20 amino acids are in all everything all 20 amino acids are in all plant Foods big myth to bust here plant Foods big myth to bust here plant Foods big myth to bust here and all animal Foods so if you're simply and all animal Foods so if you're simply and all animal Foods so if you're simply getting enough calories with a getting enough calories with a getting enough calories with a reasonable Variety in your diet like if reasonable Variety in your diet like if reasonable Variety in your diet like if you only ate rice all day you only ate rice all day you only ate rice all day you wouldn't get enough if you only ate you wouldn't get enough if you only ate you wouldn't get enough if you only ate cassava all day cassava all day cassava all day you wouldn't get enough protein but you you wouldn't get enough protein but you you wouldn't get enough protein but you also wouldn't get a lot also wouldn't get a lot also wouldn't get a lot you also wouldn't get enough of other you also wouldn't get enough of other you also wouldn't get enough of other nutrients so let me tell you how people nutrients so let me tell you how people nutrients so let me tell you how people figured out how to get enough protein figured out how to get enough protein figured out how to get enough protein this is disgusting are you ready this is disgusting are you ready this is disgusting are you ready so I got yeah we're ready so I got yeah we're ready so I got yeah we're ready I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in I got my PhD doctorate at UC Berkeley in California California California and they were one of the sites that did and they were one of the sites that did and they were one of the sites that did some of the initial trials in the 50s some of the initial trials in the 50s some of the initial trials in the 50s 60s to establish this and the fifth 60s to establish this and the fifth 60s to establish this and the fifth floor of my building Morgan Hall in floor of my building Morgan Hall in floor of my building Morgan Hall in Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we Berkeley was called The Penthouse and we got human subjects that were got human subjects that were got human subjects that were conscientious objectives to the Vietnam conscientious objectives to the Vietnam conscientious objectives to the Vietnam War War War and they volunteered to live up there in and they volunteered to live up there in and they volunteered to live up there in blue zoot suits and the scientists would blue zoot suits and the scientists would blue zoot suits and the scientists would sequentially lower their proteins sequentially lower their proteins sequentially lower their proteins successfully successively down to zero successfully successively down to zero successfully successively down to zero and give them just carbs and fats and and give them just carbs and fats and and give them just carbs and fats and then they would raise the protein back then they would raise the protein back then they would raise the protein back up slowly in their diet and every single up slowly in their diet and every single up slowly in their diet and every single day day day they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would remove the blue Zoo suit and they would vacuum it for all the hair they would vacuum it for all the hair they would vacuum it for all the hair and skin cells that sloughed off during and skin cells that sloughed off during and skin cells that sloughed off during the day they would collect all the poop the day they would collect all the poop the day they would collect all the poop all the pee all the nose blowings all the pee all the nose blowings all the pee all the nose blowings anything that left the human body anything that left the human body anything that left the human body was collected now we already talked was collected now we already talked was collected now we already talked about this nitrogen thing in protein and about this nitrogen thing in protein and about this nitrogen thing in protein and the initial studies were interestingly the initial studies were interestingly the initial studies were interestingly called called called nitrogen balance studies and instead of nitrogen balance studies and instead of nitrogen balance studies and instead of like analyzing amino acids in poop like analyzing amino acids in poop like analyzing amino acids in poop analyzing amino acids in P analyzing analyzing amino acids in P analyzing analyzing amino acids in P analyzing amino acids in hair you just burn it all amino acids in hair you just burn it all amino acids in hair you just burn it all up and analyze the nitrogen up and analyze the nitrogen up and analyze the nitrogen that's how much protein you can that's how much protein you can that's how much protein you can calculate how much protein left your calculate how much protein left your calculate how much protein left your body and then because they were body and then because they were body and then because they were nutrition scientists they were nutrition scientists they were nutrition scientists they were calculating the amount of protein or calculating the amount of protein or calculating the amount of protein or nitrogen going into the body from food nitrogen going into the body from food nitrogen going into the body from food so they knew how much is going in and so they knew how much is going in and so they knew how much is going in and how much is going out how much is going out how much is going out they raised and lowered it for each they raised and lowered it for each they raised and lowered it for each individual individual individual until they were in Balance but Jonathan until they were in Balance but Jonathan until they were in Balance but Jonathan when they did this for a bunch of people when they did this for a bunch of people when they did this for a bunch of people as you might imagine what they found out as you might imagine what they found out as you might imagine what they found out is oh my God this person in the room is oh my God this person in the room is oh my God this person in the room needed more than that person in the room needed more than that person in the room needed more than that person in the room and when they combined their data with a and when they combined their data with a and when they combined their data with a bunch of other folks who had done the bunch of other folks who had done the bunch of other folks who had done the same disgusting thing they came up with same disgusting thing they came up with same disgusting thing they came up with in math get ready for this a normal in math get ready for this a normal in math get ready for this a normal distribution curve which means ah a distribution curve which means ah a distribution curve which means ah a couple people needed very little a couple people needed very little a couple people needed very little a couple people needed a lot there's a couple people needed a lot there's a couple people needed a lot there's a bell curve so there was an average in bell curve so there was an average in bell curve so there was an average in the middle they did arrive at what would the middle they did arrive at what would the middle they did arrive at what would be the average be the average be the average okay and it's called the ear it's very okay and it's called the ear it's very okay and it's called the ear it's very specific in this huge nutrition book the specific in this huge nutrition book the specific in this huge nutrition book the estimated average requirement now here's estimated average requirement now here's estimated average requirement now here's an important question for you to think an important question for you to think an important question for you to think about when you want to come up with about when you want to come up with about when you want to come up with protein recommendations for the country protein recommendations for the country protein recommendations for the country what would you suggest recommending what would you suggest recommending what would you suggest recommending would you recommend would you recommend would you recommend the estimated average requirement the estimated average requirement the estimated average requirement because if everyone in the country got because if everyone in the country got because if everyone in the country got exactly the estimated average exactly the estimated average exactly the estimated average requirement requirement requirement by definition how many people would be by definition how many people would be by definition how many people would be deficient deficient deficient half half half because it's the average amount because it's the average amount because it's the average amount if you only get the average amount that if you only get the average amount that if you only get the average amount that half of you that are above average not half of you that are above average not half of you that are above average not just intelligently but from protein just intelligently but from protein just intelligently but from protein requirement requirement requirement would be deficient and so this happens would be deficient and so this happens would be deficient and so this happens in protein and all the vitamins and in protein and all the vitamins and in protein and all the vitamins and minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes minerals Jonathan so when the U.S comes up with recommended daily allowances for up with recommended daily allowances for up with recommended daily allowances for protein vitamins and minerals protein vitamins and minerals protein vitamins and minerals the standard approach is to take two the standard approach is to take two the standard approach is to take two standard deviations above the average standard deviations above the average standard deviations above the average and in mathematical terms that means and in mathematical terms that means and in mathematical terms that means you've picked a number you've picked a number you've picked a number that should be adequate for 97 and a that should be adequate for 97 and a that should be adequate for 97 and a half percent of the population and there half percent of the population and there half percent of the population and there might be a couple people in the tail might be a couple people in the tail might be a couple people in the tail that need even higher than that but it that need even higher than that but it that need even higher than that but it would be so few that you're pretty safe would be so few that you're pretty safe would be so few that you're pretty safe recommending that amount now not only is recommending that amount now not only is recommending that amount now not only is that mount that mount that mount adequate adequate adequate but another math thing to keep in mind but another math thing to keep in mind but another math thing to keep in mind here is if really everybody in the U.S here is if really everybody in the U.S here is if really everybody in the U.S or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 or the UK wherever got exactly that 97 and a half percent and a half percent and a half percent two standard deviations higher how many two standard deviations higher how many two standard deviations higher how many would be exceeding their requirement would be exceeding their requirement would be exceeding their requirement oh actually like 97 percent oh actually like 97 percent oh actually like 97 percent so just just to make sure I'm with you so just just to make sure I'm with you so just just to make sure I'm with you here Christopher because you know this here Christopher because you know this here Christopher because you know this is uh you're moving at some some pace is uh you're moving at some some pace is uh you're moving at some some pace you're basically saying that when they you're basically saying that when they you're basically saying that when they came up with a recommended amount for came up with a recommended amount for came up with a recommended amount for protein they basically picked then the protein they basically picked then the protein they basically picked then the amount they make sure that almost nobody amount they make sure that almost nobody amount they make sure that almost nobody would have too little and as a result would have too little and as a result would have too little and as a result you know this recommended daily amount you know this recommended daily amount you know this recommended daily amount which I've definitely heard from which I've definitely heard from which I've definitely heard from vitamins right and supplements you hear vitamins right and supplements you hear vitamins right and supplements you hear that very often but I think anytime you that very often but I think anytime you that very often but I think anytime you look on the back of a food label again look on the back of a food label again look on the back of a food label again you know I've definitely seen that for you know I've definitely seen that for you know I've definitely seen that for almost everything almost everything almost everything it's actually the amount that means it's actually the amount that means it's actually the amount that means almost everybody needs less than that almost everybody needs less than that almost everybody needs less than that yes and so if you're getting the yes and so if you're getting the yes and so if you're getting the recommended daily amount you don't need recommended daily amount you don't need recommended daily amount you don't need to worry that you're not getting enough to worry that you're not getting enough to worry that you're not getting enough actually in a sense you might you're actually in a sense you might you're actually in a sense you might you're getting more than you need for almost getting more than you need for almost getting more than you need for almost everybody is so where does this take us everybody is so where does this take us everybody is so where does this take us okay and so what that takes us to is okay and so what that takes us to is okay and so what that takes us to is they came up with a number that said 0.8 they came up with a number that said 0.8 they came up with a number that said 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body grams of protein per kilogram of body grams of protein per kilogram of body weight should meet that and so I have a weight should meet that and so I have a weight should meet that and so I have a graph and a table that I can't show you graph and a table that I can't show you graph and a table that I can't show you because we have a podcast here but for a because we have a podcast here but for a because we have a podcast here but for a lot of people that RDA level would be lot of people that RDA level would be lot of people that RDA level would be maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of maybe 40 maybe 50 maybe 60 grams of protein if if you're heavier uh so I protein if if you're heavier uh so I protein if if you're heavier uh so I have some U.S data that shows how much have some U.S data that shows how much have some U.S data that shows how much protein people eat in the U.S and it's protein people eat in the U.S and it's protein people eat in the U.S and it's pretty much double the ear or double the pretty much double the ear or double the pretty much double the ear or double the RDA RDA RDA just eating food not even trying and so just eating food not even trying and so just eating food not even trying and so to me it's sort of this American idea of to me it's sort of this American idea of to me it's sort of this American idea of god let's see that's what the RDA is but god let's see that's what the RDA is but god let's see that's what the RDA is but I know I'm above average so let me make I know I'm above average so let me make I know I'm above average so let me make sure I get some extra here it's like no sure I get some extra here it's like no sure I get some extra here it's like no you don't understand the concept it was you don't understand the concept it was you don't understand the concept it was built in to recognize that some people built in to recognize that some people built in to recognize that some people would need more would need more would need more and as a nutritionist when I teach and as a nutritionist when I teach and as a nutritionist when I teach students I have to say this is not an students I have to say this is not an students I have to say this is not an individual approach you should not look individual approach you should not look individual approach you should not look at the RDA to see if you are meeting at the RDA to see if you are meeting at the RDA to see if you are meeting your individual requirement this is a your individual requirement this is a your individual requirement this is a population health approach so that if population health approach so that if population health approach so that if everybody were to get that amount almost everybody were to get that amount almost everybody were to get that amount almost no one no one no one would be deficient and just as you were would be deficient and just as you were would be deficient and just as you were a bit surprised every time I tell that a bit surprised every time I tell that a bit surprised every time I tell that story the audience I explain it to story the audience I explain it to story the audience I explain it to is a little surprise is a little surprise is a little surprise and so Christopher you know I am and so Christopher you know I am and so Christopher you know I am surprised because I've had this surprised because I've had this surprised because I've had this experience and I suspect there's quite a experience and I suspect there's quite a experience and I suspect there's quite a lot of people who've had this experience lot of people who've had this experience lot of people who've had this experience so like the first time I ever went to uh so like the first time I ever went to uh so like the first time I ever went to uh a gym which is about 10 years ago and a gym which is about 10 years ago and a gym which is about 10 years ago and um I had a trainer say you know this is um I had a trainer say you know this is um I had a trainer say you know this is what you need to do in order to get what you need to do in order to get what you need to do in order to get healthier which is what I was interested healthier which is what I was interested healthier which is what I was interested in and fitter well the first thing you in and fitter well the first thing you in and fitter well the first thing you said is oh well you need to eat more said is oh well you need to eat more said is oh well you need to eat more protein and you need to eat at least a protein and you need to eat at least a protein and you need to eat at least a gram per kilogram of gram per kilogram of gram per kilogram of um of protein if you're going to get you um of protein if you're going to get you um of protein if you're going to get you know any benefits out of the work that know any benefits out of the work that know any benefits out of the work that you're going to do at the gym now that you're going to do at the gym now that you're going to do at the gym now that number because I think you just said it number because I think you just said it number because I think you just said it was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your was 0.8 grams per kilogram was your recommended amount which is like the recommended amount which is like the recommended amount which is like the maximum that anyone in the world maximum that anyone in the world maximum that anyone in the world basically needs basically needs basically needs um um um how did this happen why is there there how did this happen why is there there how did this happen why is there there this controversy help me to understand this controversy help me to understand this controversy help me to understand why there's this pressure about why there's this pressure about why there's this pressure about feeling people need to eat more protein feeling people need to eat more protein feeling people need to eat more protein sure okay so let's think about that word sure okay so let's think about that word sure okay so let's think about that word so there is there are some flaws with so there is there are some flaws with so there is there are some flaws with this nitrogen balance study that I this nitrogen balance study that I this nitrogen balance study that I suggested and so what happens in at suggested and so what happens in at suggested and so what happens in at least the US from all the databases I least the US from all the databases I least the US from all the databases I have is have is have is this is this is very consistent in all this is this is very consistent in all this is this is very consistent in all research studies that I look at research studies that I look at research studies that I look at most people get about 16 17 18 of their most people get about 16 17 18 of their most people get about 16 17 18 of their calories from protein it's so consistent calories from protein it's so consistent calories from protein it's so consistent it's just amazing it's just amazing it's just amazing and then you look at how many calories and then you look at how many calories and then you look at how many calories you eat to maintain your weight and you eat to maintain your weight and you eat to maintain your weight and let's not go down this rabbit hole but let's not go down this rabbit hole but let's not go down this rabbit hole but most people underestimate how many most people underestimate how many most people underestimate how many calories they eat the data I have says calories they eat the data I have says calories they eat the data I have says women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men women eat 2 500 calories a day and Men eat three thousand and I know a lot of eat three thousand and I know a lot of eat three thousand and I know a lot of your listeners are going to say not me I your listeners are going to say not me I your listeners are going to say not me I only eat 1500 calories a day we've done only eat 1500 calories a day we've done only eat 1500 calories a day we've done feeding studies where we gave people a feeding studies where we gave people a feeding studies where we gave people a certain amount of calories certain amount of calories certain amount of calories and it's really two thousand twenty five and it's really two thousand twenty five and it's really two thousand twenty five hundred or three thousand if you take 16 hundred or three thousand if you take 16 hundred or three thousand if you take 16 17 18 percent 17 18 percent 17 18 percent of those numbers of those numbers of those numbers people tend to get about 1.5 grams of people tend to get about 1.5 grams of people tend to get about 1.5 grams of protein per kilogram body weight without protein per kilogram body weight without protein per kilogram body weight without trying trying trying they're they're pretty much getting they're they're pretty much getting they're they're pretty much getting double the RDA so now here's what double the RDA so now here's what double the RDA so now here's what happens if you're in the gym getting happens if you're in the gym getting happens if you're in the gym getting that double the RDA right okay so it's that double the RDA right okay so it's that double the RDA right okay so it's probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met probably the 0.8 grams per kilogram met your need for enzymes hormones your need for enzymes hormones your need for enzymes hormones fingernails and hair fingernails and hair fingernails and hair you went to the gym to lift weights and you went to the gym to lift weights and you went to the gym to lift weights and gain muscle so you probably want more gain muscle so you probably want more gain muscle so you probably want more than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day so you can put muscle on so you can put muscle on so you can put muscle on okay so let me tell you let me tell you okay so let me tell you let me tell you okay so let me tell you let me tell you how many extra grams of protein you need how many extra grams of protein you need how many extra grams of protein you need so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to so Jonathan how ambitious would it be to put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure put on 22 pounds or 10 kilos of pure muscle in one year would that be pretty muscle in one year would that be pretty muscle in one year would that be pretty good that that I have to say it sounds good that that I have to say it sounds good that that I have to say it sounds quite ambitious I think if anybody saw quite ambitious I think if anybody saw quite ambitious I think if anybody saw me they would say totally ridiculous and me they would say totally ridiculous and me they would say totally ridiculous and impossible but let's go with ambitious impossible but let's go with ambitious impossible but let's go with ambitious shall we shall we shall we okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually okay ambitious so 10 kilos uh actually 70 of your muscle is water 70 of your muscle is water 70 of your muscle is water so if you were going to do that in a so if you were going to do that in a so if you were going to do that in a year all you'd actually have to year all you'd actually have to year all you'd actually have to accumulate is three kilos of extra amino accumulate is three kilos of extra amino accumulate is three kilos of extra amino acids or 3 000 grams acids or 3 000 grams acids or 3 000 grams of extra amino acids divide that into of extra amino acids divide that into of extra amino acids divide that into 365 days of the year and just roughly 365 days of the year and just roughly 365 days of the year and just roughly that means you would need an extra 10 that means you would need an extra 10 that means you would need an extra 10 grams of protein a day to keep retain in grams of protein a day to keep retain in grams of protein a day to keep retain in addition to meeting your maintenance addition to meeting your maintenance addition to meeting your maintenance needs to put this on now it's not quite needs to put this on now it's not quite needs to put this on now it's not quite a fair number because when you're in the a fair number because when you're in the a fair number because when you're in the gym lifting and working out if you're gym lifting and working out if you're gym lifting and working out if you're working out really hard you're actually working out really hard you're actually working out really hard you're actually breaking down some muscle using those breaking down some muscle using those breaking down some muscle using those amino acids and you have to replace them amino acids and you have to replace them amino acids and you have to replace them so put another 10 grams on that say you so put another 10 grams on that say you so put another 10 grams on that say you needed an extra 20 grams a day every day needed an extra 20 grams a day every day needed an extra 20 grams a day every day for a year for a year for a year to put this on in the U.S people are to put this on in the U.S people are to put this on in the U.S people are eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day eating like 30 or 40. extra grams a day over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every over that 0.8 gram per kilogram every day just eating food and one more tidbit day just eating food and one more tidbit day just eating food and one more tidbit I have here is when you're working out I have here is when you're working out I have here is when you're working out hard every day don't you eat more hard every day don't you eat more hard every day don't you eat more you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories you do you don't eat just 2 000 calories I have a Stanford football player who's I have a Stanford football player who's I have a Stanford football player who's in one of the Rose Bowl games in one of the Rose Bowl games in one of the Rose Bowl games he was eating 5 000 calories a day he was eating 5 000 calories a day he was eating 5 000 calories a day because they work him so hard because they work him so hard because they work him so hard he was getting 260 grams of protein he was getting 260 grams of protein he was getting 260 grams of protein every day without trying he wasn't every day without trying he wasn't every day without trying he wasn't having shakes he was just having food having shakes he was just having food having shakes he was just having food so we we should go to like which foods so we we should go to like which foods so we we should go to like which foods have that protein but if we could go have that protein but if we could go have that protein but if we could go here I have one more place to go is well here I have one more place to go is well here I have one more place to go is well wait is that bad what if you actually wait is that bad what if you actually wait is that bad what if you actually got more protein got more protein got more protein then you need it what what would happen then you need it what what would happen then you need it what what would happen to all that extra will it kill you to to all that extra will it kill you to to all that extra will it kill you to have more protein what happens have more protein what happens have more protein what happens okay so but I want to go down a rabbit okay so but I want to go down a rabbit okay so but I want to go down a rabbit hole just for a minute for a fun hole just for a minute for a fun hole just for a minute for a fun exercise so think on an average day you exercise so think on an average day you exercise so think on an average day you probably eat more carbohydrates than you probably eat more carbohydrates than you probably eat more carbohydrates than you need and so once you've eaten some need and so once you've eaten some need and so once you've eaten some carbohydrate the first thing it says oh carbohydrate the first thing it says oh carbohydrate the first thing it says oh my God does my brain need it right now my God does my brain need it right now my God does my brain need it right now nope my brain's okay nope my brain's okay nope my brain's okay um do I does my do I my muscles need it um do I does my do I my muscles need it um do I does my do I my muscles need it now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan now I'm doing a podcast with Jonathan I'm just sitting here I don't really I'm just sitting here I don't really I'm just sitting here I don't really need my muscles okay well I have a need my muscles okay well I have a need my muscles okay well I have a storage Depot for my carbohydrate and storage Depot for my carbohydrate and storage Depot for my carbohydrate and it's called glycogen and there's some in it's called glycogen and there's some in it's called glycogen and there's some in my muscles and there's some in my liver my muscles and there's some in my liver my muscles and there's some in my liver so I will try to fill up my storage so I will try to fill up my storage so I will try to fill up my storage capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate capacity of glycogen stored carbohydrate so that I can have some later in the day so that I can have some later in the day so that I can have some later in the day and do you know how long it would take and do you know how long it would take and do you know how long it would take you to deplete all the storage you to deplete all the storage you to deplete all the storage carbohydrate in your body any idea do carbohydrate in your body any idea do carbohydrate in your body any idea do you are you a runner Jonathan actually I you are you a runner Jonathan actually I you are you a runner Jonathan actually I don't know this if you're a runner no don't know this if you're a runner no don't know this if you're a runner no I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair I'm I'm very good at sitting in my chair doing podcasts but tell me how long does doing podcasts but tell me how long does doing podcasts but tell me how long does it last for it last for it last for so I bet you've heard that marathon so I bet you've heard that marathon so I bet you've heard that marathon runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't runners at 20 miles Bonk if they don't have enough carbohydrate that basically have enough carbohydrate that basically have enough carbohydrate that basically means you've used up all the glycogen means you've used up all the glycogen means you've used up all the glycogen that you stored in your body it's only that you stored in your body it's only that you stored in your body it's only about a kilo about a kilo about a kilo okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so okay let's switch for a minute to Fat so let's say you ate more fat calories for let's say you ate more fat calories for let's say you ate more fat calories for the day and you used it for various the day and you used it for various the day and you used it for various things and mostly you burned it for things and mostly you burned it for things and mostly you burned it for energy energy energy where would you store that and how much where would you store that and how much where would you store that and how much could you store and I'll save you the could you store and I'll save you the could you store and I'll save you the trouble here you can store an infinite trouble here you can store an infinite trouble here you can store an infinite capacity of fat oh my gosh you can store capacity of fat oh my gosh you can store capacity of fat oh my gosh you can store hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat in your butt in your pounds of fat in your butt in your pounds of fat in your butt in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your thighs in your jowls in the pads in your fingers endless capacity to store fat fingers endless capacity to store fat fingers endless capacity to store fat would take you an incredibly long time would take you an incredibly long time would take you an incredibly long time to use up all the storage of fat that to use up all the storage of fat that to use up all the storage of fat that you have in your body so unlimited you have in your body so unlimited you have in your body so unlimited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store fat a very limited capacity to store carbohydrate where capacity to store carbohydrate where capacity to store carbohydrate where could the extra protein go so your your could the extra protein go so your your could the extra protein go so your your trainer told you to do this trainer told you to do this trainer told you to do this you ate all that extra protein you ate all that extra protein you ate all that extra protein a few major enzymes you made your a few major enzymes you made your a few major enzymes you made your hormones you lifted your weights and it hormones you lifted your weights and it hormones you lifted your weights and it was a little more than you needed or was a little more than you needed or was a little more than you needed or maybe a lot more and you're going to bed maybe a lot more and you're going to bed maybe a lot more and you're going to bed tonight so where do you think you put it tonight so where do you think you put it tonight so where do you think you put it in your body is it in your spleen in in your body is it in your spleen in in your body is it in your spleen in your liver in your big toe in your elbow your liver in your big toe in your elbow your liver in your big toe in your elbow where's your protein storage where's your protein storage where's your protein storage where is my protein storage none every where is my protein storage none every where is my protein storage none every bit of it at the end of the day has the bit of it at the end of the day has the bit of it at the end of the day has the nitrogen taken off and it gets turned nitrogen taken off and it gets turned nitrogen taken off and it gets turned into carbs and fat you can't store into carbs and fat you can't store into carbs and fat you can't store protein in your body so the muscle heads protein in your body so the muscle heads protein in your body so the muscle heads who are having who are having who are having a lot of meat and regular meals and a a lot of meat and regular meals and a a lot of meat and regular meals and a protein shake and a protein bar protein shake and a protein bar protein shake and a protein bar are turning all that into carbs and fats are turning all that into carbs and fats are turning all that into carbs and fats at the end of the day and I'm just going at the end of the day and I'm just going at the end of the day and I'm just going to turn it into basically fat that I lay to turn it into basically fat that I lay to turn it into basically fat that I lay down on my body is that what you're down on my body is that what you're down on my body is that what you're telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be telling me and yeah the nitrogen will be taken off your liver will turn it into taken off your liver will turn it into taken off your liver will turn it into ammonia and your kidney will excrete it ammonia and your kidney will excrete it ammonia and your kidney will excrete it and get it out of your body and so you and get it out of your body and so you and get it out of your body and so you actually could suck out some calcium as actually could suck out some calcium as actually could suck out some calcium as it goes and so some people say don't eat it goes and so some people say don't eat it goes and so some people say don't eat too much protein it'll suck the calcium too much protein it'll suck the calcium too much protein it'll suck the calcium out of your bones let's not go down that out of your bones let's not go down that out of your bones let's not go down that rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen rabbit hole it probably doesn't happen most people with a healthy kidney can most people with a healthy kidney can most people with a healthy kidney can eliminate this just fine you you might eliminate this just fine you you might eliminate this just fine you you might know that if someone has an impaired know that if someone has an impaired know that if someone has an impaired kidney one of the first things they do kidney one of the first things they do kidney one of the first things they do from a dietary perspective is they ask from a dietary perspective is they ask from a dietary perspective is they ask them to limit their protein them to limit their protein them to limit their protein because they don't want their their because they don't want their their because they don't want their their impaired kidney to face the challenge of impaired kidney to face the challenge of impaired kidney to face the challenge of clearing more of this excess ammonia clearing more of this excess ammonia clearing more of this excess ammonia from the excess protein from the excess protein from the excess protein that most people get in a day but to be that most people get in a day but to be that most people get in a day but to be honest most people's bodies are set up honest most people's bodies are set up honest most people's bodies are set up to handle this to handle this to handle this turn it into carbon fat and get rid of turn it into carbon fat and get rid of turn it into carbon fat and get rid of the ammonia for so for most people the ammonia for so for most people the ammonia for so for most people eating that protein eating that protein eating that protein isn't necessarily bad for you unless you isn't necessarily bad for you unless you isn't necessarily bad for you unless you consider consider consider what came with it so if this is what I what came with it so if this is what I what came with it so if this is what I was supposed to say isn't this like a I was supposed to say isn't this like a I was supposed to say isn't this like a I feel like this is a huge scam so feel like this is a huge scam so feel like this is a huge scam so basically there are all these products basically there are all these products basically there are all these products that are on sale that say you know no that are on sale that say you know no that are on sale that say you know no carbs 10 grams of protein or you know carbs 10 grams of protein or you know carbs 10 grams of protein or you know like no sugar 10 grams of protein and like no sugar 10 grams of protein and like no sugar 10 grams of protein and then you're telling me I eat it I then you're telling me I eat it I then you're telling me I eat it I haven't I'm already eating more protein haven't I'm already eating more protein haven't I'm already eating more protein than I need so my body is just going to than I need so my body is just going to than I need so my body is just going to turn that turn that turn that into carbs and fat and since I we know I into carbs and fat and since I we know I into carbs and fat and since I we know I already am eating as much food as I need already am eating as much food as I need already am eating as much food as I need like if I'm having that on top I'm just like if I'm having that on top I'm just like if I'm having that on top I'm just basically going to turn it into body fat basically going to turn it into body fat basically going to turn it into body fat is that have I got that right and so in is that have I got that right and so in is that have I got that right and so in the end it all comes down to calories so the end it all comes down to calories so the end it all comes down to calories so Jonathan we just finished a fun little Jonathan we just finished a

sent me saying the month that someone sent me saying the month that someone sent me saying the same thing and Stu Phillips who's a same thing and Stu Phillips who's a same thing and Stu Phillips who's a fantastic exercise guy from McMaster fantastic exercise guy from McMaster fantastic exercise guy from McMaster University he and I did a podcast University he and I did a podcast University he and I did a podcast together together together and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per and said yes you know that 0.8 grams per kilogram number isn't right it should be kilogram number isn't right it should be kilogram number isn't right it should be higher than that it it may need to be as higher than that it it may need to be as higher than that it it may need to be as high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that high as 1.6 and I said but isn't that what people eat anyway he said well yeah what people eat anyway he said well yeah what people eat anyway he said well yeah that's actually what they get anyway so that's actually what they get anyway so that's actually what they get anyway so if you weren't getting that much it's if you weren't getting that much it's if you weren't getting that much it's possible you could be impaired and you possible you could be impaired and you possible you could be impaired and you would benefit from this but if you were would benefit from this but if you were would benefit from this but if you were tracking your calories right tracking your calories right tracking your

little bit of want however to spend a little bit of want however to spend a little bit of time talking through sort of the the time talking through sort of the the time talking through sort of the the different ages of people because we had different ages of people because we had different ages of people because we had so many questions on social from our so many questions on social from our so many questions on social from our listeners about concerns about protein listeners about concerns about protein listeners about concerns about protein requirements at different ages so I requirements at different ages so I requirements at different ages so I would love to start actually maybe with would love to start actually maybe with would love to start actually maybe with children children children um and I just have this sort of personal um and I just have this sort of personal um and I just have this sort of personal experience right now so I have a 15 year experience right now so I have a 15 year experience right now so I have a 15 year old and his friends have started old and his friends have started old and his friends have started drinking these new energy drinks that drinking these new energy drinks that drinking these new energy drinks that say they have added protein which is a say they have added protein which is a say they have added protein which is a new thing for me that wasn't what I you new thing for me that wasn't what I you new thing for me that wasn't what I you know I wasn't even aware that that was know I wasn't even aware that that was know I wasn't even aware that that was the that that was a a thing they've gone the that that was a a thing they've gone the that that was a a thing they've gone past caffeine is there any evidence that past caffeine is there any evidence that past caffeine is there any evidence that at this point when you're growing really at this point when you're growing really at this point when you're growing really fast that actually kids might not be fast that actually kids might not be fast that actually kids might not be getting enough protein and we need to getting enough protein and we need to getting enough protein and we need to really worry about that really worry about that really worry about that yep so for kids if you go back to all yep so for kids if you go back to all yep so for kids if you go back to all those old RDA calculations those old RDA calculations those old RDA calculations kids need not 0.8 grams but at different kids need not 0.8 grams but at different kids need not 0.8 grams but at different ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 ages they need 0.9 1.0 1.1 because they're growing because they're growing because they're growing similarly for a pregnant woman that's similarly for a pregnant woman that's similarly for a pregnant woman that's growing a fetus inside of her she's not growing a fetus inside of her she's not growing a fetus inside of her she's not just maintaining she's growing just maintaining she's growing just maintaining she's growing and so those needs are higher than 0.8 and so those needs are higher than 0.8 and so those needs are higher than 0.8 grams per kilogram per day the question grams per kilogram per day the question grams per kilogram per day the question is can you get that just eating food or is can you get that just eating food or is can you get that just eating food or do you need to get these extra sources do you need to get these extra sources do you need to get these extra sources and as as I'm suggesting the food supply and as as I'm suggesting the food supply and as as I'm suggesting the food supply as long as you get a reasonable variety as long as you get a reasonable variety as long as you get a reasonable variety and we should get into plant food versus and we should get into plant food versus and we should get into plant food versus animal food but you would have to work animal food but you would have to work animal food but you would have to work really hard not to get that much protein really hard not to get that much protein really hard not to get that much protein Jonathan I attended the job talk of a Jonathan I attended the job talk of a Jonathan I attended the job talk of a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nephrologist at Stanford who isn't a nutrition person said God you know I'm nutrition person said God you know I'm nutrition person said God you know I'm trying to work with these people with trying to work with these people with trying to work with these people with impaired kidneys and I've been trying to impaired kidneys and I've been trying to impaired kidneys and I've been trying to get them on this really severely get them on this really severely get them on this really severely restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per restricted protein diet of 0.7 grams per kilogram body weight and I I can't get kilogram body weight and I I can't get kilogram body weight and I I can't get them there them there them there and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per and I laughed and I said 0.7 grams per kilogram it's severely restricted kilogram it's severely restricted kilogram it's severely restricted protein protein protein that's practically the RDA he said yeah that's practically the RDA he said yeah that's practically the RDA he said yeah I can't get them that low I get them to I can't get them that low I get them to I can't get them that low I get them to try to eat this and that and then I try to eat this and that and then I try to eat this and that and then I can't get them that low can't get them that low can't get them that low it's hard not to get it and so does that it's hard not to get it and so does that it's hard not to get it and so does that mean you know as a parent you know you mean you know as a parent you know you mean you know as a parent you know you don't really need to worry about it don't really need to worry about it don't really need to worry about it um but isn't your refrigerator empty so um but isn't your refrigerator empty so um but isn't your refrigerator empty so I have four boys yes he does eat a lot I have four boys yes he does eat a lot I have four boys yes he does eat a lot of food there's no doubt bring their of food there's no doubt bring their of food there's no doubt bring their friends and it's like I skip dinner friends and it's like I skip dinner friends and it's like I skip dinner really aren't you eating oh no I had really aren't you eating oh no I had really aren't you eating oh no I had like two pizzas a half an hour ago but like two pizzas a half an hour ago but like two pizzas a half an hour ago but I'm skipping it oh my God and then I go I'm skipping it oh my God and then I go I'm skipping it oh my God and then I go out at

you have to make it could be that you have to make it could be that you have to make special effort to make sure in the small special effort to make sure in the small special effort to make sure in the small number of calories that they're getting number of calories that they're getting number of calories that they're getting that they are protein rich that they are protein rich that they are protein rich because they're just not eating very because they're just not eating very because they're just not eating very much much much so Christopher you'd be very patient so Christopher you'd be very patient so Christopher you'd be very patient about not talking about where the about not talking about where the about not talking about where the protein comes from so thank you let's protein comes from so thank you let's protein comes from so thank you let's um do that and we had lots of people um do that and we had lots of people um do that and we had lots of people asking us basically you know sort of asking us basically you know sort of asking us basically you know sort of versions of the same question is animal versions of the same question is animal versions of the same question is animal protein better than plant protein and protein better than plant protein and protein better than plant protein and um you know how are they different you um you know how are they different you um you know how are they different you know and why is it that one might be know and why is it that one might be know and why is it that one might be better than the other better than the other better than the other yeah so you're killing me this is a yeah so you're killing me this is a yeah so you're killing me this is a podcast because I can't tell you how podcast because I can't tell you how podcast because I can't tell you how many hours I spent making slides showing many hours I spent making slides showing many hours I spent making slides showing different amino acids at this point different amino acids at this point different amino acids at this point really have to get down to that amino really have to get down to that amino really have to get down to that amino acid level and so I'm gonna do my best acid level and so I'm gonna do my best acid level and so I'm gonna do my best to describe some of these slides I made to describe some of these slides I made to describe some of these slides I made Jonathan so if you look at the estimated Jonathan so if you look at the estimated Jonathan so if you look at the estimated average requirement of protein for a lot average requirement of protein for a lot average requirement of protein for a lot of people it could be close to 40 grams of people it could be close to 40 grams of people it could be close to 40 grams of protein which is pretty low and I I of protein which is pretty low and I I of protein which is pretty low and I I like to use that number just for fun to like to use that number just for fun to like to use that number just for fun to make this one point there are 20 amino make this one point there are 20 amino make this one point there are 20 amino acids acids acids if you need 40 grams of protein if you need 40 grams of protein if you need 40 grams of protein simplistically that sounds like it would simplistically that sounds like it would simplistically that sounds like it would be good to have two grams of each one 2 be good to have two grams of each one 2 be good to have two grams of each one 2 times 20 is 40. times 20 is 40. times 20 is 40. not even close not even close not even close so you need tons of glutamate glutamine so you need tons of glutamate glutamine so you need tons of glutamate glutamine aspartate asparaging you need hardly any aspartate asparaging you need hardly any aspartate asparaging you need hardly any tryptophan methionine cysteine tryptophan methionine cysteine tryptophan methionine cysteine and the best way I've found to describe and the best way I've found to describe and the best way I've found to describe this is the game of Scrabble this is the game of Scrabble this is the game of Scrabble so Scrabble which my wife beats me at so Scrabble which my wife beats me at so Scrabble which my wife beats me at regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag regularly is a hundred tiles in a bag and I don't know if you know this from and I don't know if you know this from and I don't know if you know this from one country to the other the one country to the other the one country to the other the distribution of letters is a little bit distribution of letters is a little bit distribution of letters is a little bit different depending on how often those different depending on how often those different depending on how often those letters are used in the language of that letters are used in the language of that letters are used in the language of that I'm learning about Scrabble and protein I'm learning about Scrabble and protein I'm learning about Scrabble and protein now Christopher said it's great so think now Christopher said it's great so think now Christopher said it's great so think 26 letters in the alphabet there's a 26 letters in the alphabet there's a 26 letters in the alphabet there's a hundred tiles aren't there four of each hundred tiles aren't there four of each hundred tiles aren't there four of each letter in the Scrabble bag to make your letter in the Scrabble bag to make your letter in the Scrabble bag to make your words no there's only one Z there's one words no there's only one Z there's one words no there's only one Z there's one X One J and there are a whole lot of E's X One J and there are a whole lot of E's X One J and there are a whole lot of E's and A's and n's and ours amino acids are and A's and n's and ours amino acids are and A's and n's and ours amino acids are just like that just like that just like that so what I did is I sort of made a graph so what I did is I sort of made a graph so what I did is I sort of made a graph and I showed ah here's the distribution and I showed ah here's the distribution and I showed ah here's the distribution of 40 grams of protein in eggs in of 40 grams of protein in eggs in of 40 grams of protein in eggs in chicken in pork in fish in beef and chicken in pork in fish in beef and chicken in pork in fish in beef and they're stun the distribution is they're stun the distribution is they're stun the distribution is stunningly stunningly stunningly similar they say wow that's that's similar they say wow that's that's similar they say wow that's that's pretty interesting all the animals have pretty interesting all the animals have pretty interesting all the animals have a lot of the same ones and a few of the a lot of the same ones and a few of the a lot of the same ones and a few of the same ones and then I say okay so you've same ones and then I say okay so you've same ones and then I say okay so you've all heard plants are missing amino acids all heard plants are missing amino acids all heard plants are missing amino acids which ones do you think they're missing which ones do you think they're missing which ones do you think they're missing are different plants missing different are different plants missing different are different plants missing different amino acids and I put up some fake data amino acids and I put up some fake data amino acids and I put up some fake data and I say which one do you think is rice and I say which one do you think is rice and I say which one do you think is rice and beans and broccoli and I I don't let and beans and broccoli and I I don't let and beans and broccoli and I I don't let them think for long and then I put up them think for long and then I put up them think for long and then I put up the actual amino acid distribution and the actual amino acid distribution and the actual amino acid distribution and their jaws drop their jaws drop their jaws drop all of the plants have all 20 amino all of the plants have all 20 amino all of the plants have all 20 amino acids the distribution of the amino acids the distribution of the amino acids the distribution of the amino acids is almost identical in the plants acids is almost identical in the plants acids is almost identical in the plants as the animal and they say what have as the animal and they say what have as the animal and they say what have been people telling me Professor Gardner been people telling me Professor Gardner been people telling me Professor Gardner are you lying did you like make this up are you lying did you like make this up are you lying did you like make this up because this this is not the reality because this this is not the reality because this this is not the reality that I've been told and it's a very that I've been told and it's a very that I've been told and it's a very simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so simple kind of trivial thing Jonathan so rice and other grains in general tend to rice and other grains in general tend to rice and other grains in general tend to be low in the proportion of Lysine that be low in the proportion of Lysine that be low in the proportion of Lysine that they have relative to the optimal they have relative to the optimal they have relative to the optimal proportion proportion proportion and likewise beans tend to be low in and likewise beans tend to be low in and likewise beans tend to be low in methionine and cysteine methionine and cysteine methionine and cysteine in proportion in proportion in proportion to what they need and so I like this to what they need and so I like this to what they need and so I like this Scrabble analogy so picture that you've Scrabble analogy so picture that you've Scrabble analogy so picture that you've had the Scrabble game for a really long had the Scrabble game for a really long had the Scrabble game for a really long time and you lost the L for lysine and time and you lost the L for lysine and time and you lost the L for lysine and the M for methionine the M for methionine the M for methionine are you missing all valves and all the are you missing all valves and all the are you missing all valves and all the M's no no actually you only lost a M's no no actually you only lost a M's no no actually you only lost a couple of the letters so if you were couple of the letters so if you were couple of the letters so if you were using your board and trying to make using your board and trying to make using your board and trying to make words you would run out of words you words you would run out of words you words you would run out of words you could make with l and m sooner could make with l and m sooner could make with l and m sooner what if you had a neighbor who also what if you had a neighbor who also what if you had a neighbor who also hadn't played Scrabble in a long time hadn't played Scrabble in a long time hadn't played Scrabble in a long time and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're and they'd said oh I'm so sorry you're missing those letters you can have my missing those letters you can have my missing those letters you can have my Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also Scrabble bag of letters oh I'm also missing an l and an M I'm sorry you missing an l and an M I'm sorry you missing an l and an M I'm sorry you could still fill up the L and the M that could still fill up the L and the M that could still fill up the L and the M that you were missing because your neighbor you were missing because your neighbor you were missing because your neighbor has extra L's and M's and I think has extra L's and M's and I think has extra L's and M's and I think Americans eat at least 80 grams of Americans eat at least 80 grams of Americans eat at least 80 grams of protein a day not 40 that they need protein a day not 40 that they need protein a day not 40 that they need and so I'm thinking what if you had two and so I'm thinking what if you had two and so I'm thinking what if you had two bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like bags of Scrabble letters oh that's like what Americans eat in protein every day what Americans eat in protein every day what Americans eat in protein every day two bags of Scrabble letters and if two bags of Scrabble letters and if two bags of Scrabble letters and if they're eating plant proteins they are they're eating plant proteins they are they're eating plant proteins they are lower in lysine and methionine lower in lysine and methionine lower in lysine and methionine then would be optimal but that's only a then would be optimal but that's only a then would be optimal but that's only a concern if they only get 40 grams of concern if they only get 40 grams of concern if they only get 40 grams of protein and they need every amino acid protein and they need every amino acid protein and they need every amino acid to count but they get 80 grams of to count but they get 80 grams of to count but they get 80 grams of protein even the vegetarians and the protein even the vegetarians and the protein even the vegetarians and the vegans and Christopher just one vegans and Christopher just one vegans and Christopher just one clarifications I think that it sounds clarifications I think that it sounds clarifications I think that it sounds like a general saying don't worry about like a general saying don't worry about like a general saying don't worry about this are you saying because you're this are you saying because you're this are you saying because you're mentioning two particular amino acids mentioning two particular amino acids mentioning two particular amino acids that I can't pronounce that I can't pronounce that I can't pronounce um um um are you saying that in all plants the are you saying that in all plants the are you saying that in all plants the relative amount of that is lower than it relative amount of that is lower than it relative amount of that is lower than it is in animals is in animals is in animals um so even if you're having a variety of um so even if you're having a variety of um so even if you're having a variety of plants so it's not just that like one plants so it's not just that like one plants so it's not just that like one plant is low in the L and the other one plant is low in the L and the other one plant is low in the L and the other one is low and yeah I'm actually on average is low and yeah I'm actually on average is low and yeah I'm actually on average like all plants are lower in that like all plants are lower in that like all plants are lower in that relative to animals and therefore if you relative to animals and therefore if you relative to animals and therefore if you were eating a plant-only diet then if were eating a plant-only diet then if were eating a plant-only diet then if you were going to eat the 40 grams of you were going to eat the 40 grams of you were going to eat the 40 grams of protein you're going to have potentially protein you're going to have potentially protein you're going to have potentially a low level of those two particular a low level of those two particular a low level of those two particular amino acids I just want to make sure amino acids I just want to make sure amino acids I just want to make sure that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not that I'm yeah if you needed 40. it's not really it's you need 40. you need 40 in really it's you need 40. you need 40 in really it's you need 40. you need 40 in the right distribution the right distribution the right distribution if you only ate rice all day that's how if you only ate rice all day that's how if you only ate rice all day that's how you got your 40 grams of protein you you got your 40 grams of protein you you got your 40 grams of protein you wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 wouldn't have enough even if you ate 40 total grams of protein you run out of total grams of protein you run out of total grams of protein you run out of Lysine too soon if you only ate beans Lysine too soon if you only ate beans Lysine too soon if you only ate beans you'd run out of methionine you'd run out of methionine you'd run out of methionine before you got enough so you could before you got enough so you could before you got enough so you could supplement with just those individual supplement with just those individual supplement with just those individual amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of amino acids or you could eat 80 grams of protein a day protein a day protein a day and you would end up getting the things and you would end up getting the things and you would end up getting the things that you're missing now here's what that you're missing now here's what that you're missing now here's what happens is you really only needed 40 and happens is you really only needed 40 and happens is you really only needed 40 and you 880 you 880 you 880 what do you do with the extra 40 you what do you do with the extra 40 you what do you do with the extra 40 you break 40 down and turn it into break 40 down and turn it into break 40 down and turn it into carbohydrate and fat but that's carbohydrate and fat but that's carbohydrate and fat but that's typically what's happening typically what's happening typically what's happening is that people eat more than the total is that people eat more than the total is that people eat more than the total amount they need amount they need amount they need and so given that plants don't have the and so given that plants don't have the and so given that plants don't have the ideal distribution of the amino acids ideal distribution of the amino acids ideal distribution of the amino acids they're almost always covered they're almost always covered they're almost always covered and you just break down the other ones and you just break down the other ones and you just break down the other ones so there is Jonathan an old concept that so there is Jonathan an old concept that so there is Jonathan an old concept that was written up in Francis Moore Lopez was written up in Francis Moore Lopez was written up in Francis Moore Lopez died for a small planet about died for a small planet about died for a small planet about complementing your proteins because complementing your proteins because complementing your proteins because the grains that are a little low in the grains that are a little low in the grains that are a little low in lysine are a little high in methionine lysine are a little high in methionine lysine are a little high in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine and beans are a little low in methionine but they're a little high in lysine I'm but they're a little high in lysine I'm but they're a little high in lysine I'm gonna say ah this is sort of a gonna say ah this is sort of a gonna say ah this is sort of a no-brainer that's why some populations no-brainer that's why some populations no-brainer that's why some populations ate grains and beans together ate grains and beans together ate grains and beans together because they complemented the because they complemented the because they complemented the deficiencies with the excesses and it's deficiencies with the excesses and it's deficiencies with the excesses and it's still never quite as good as meat it's still never quite as good as meat it's still never quite as good as meat it's still not the optimal distribution still not the optimal distribution still not the optimal distribution but it's closer to Optimal so you can but it's closer to Optimal so you can but it's closer to Optimal so you can either try to complement them or you either try to complement them or you either try to complement them or you cannot worry about it because you're cannot worry about it because you're cannot worry about it because you're probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't probably 880 or 90 grams and you didn't really have to think about it so you can really have to think about it so you can really have to think about it so you can absolutely meet all your needs on a absolutely meet all your needs on a absolutely meet all your needs on a completely plant-based diet stop completely plant-based diet stop completely plant-based diet stop obsessing about protein obsessing about protein obsessing about protein thank you brilliant answer so let's say thank you brilliant answer so let's say thank you brilliant answer so let's say that that that um someone's listening to all of this um someone's listening to all of this um someone's listening to all of this you haven't managed to completely you haven't managed to completely you haven't managed to completely convince them that they shouldn't have convince them that they shouldn't have convince them that they shouldn't have protein because you know it's hard to protein because you know it's hard to protein because you know it's hard to shake that so they're saying okay but shake that so they're saying okay but shake that so they're saying okay but like I'm worried or maybe I do fit into like I'm worried or maybe I do fit into like I'm worried or maybe I do fit into one of those categories that we're one of those categories that we're one of those categories that we're talking about where they are potentially talking about where

yeah yeah yeah wonderful Christopher this has been an wonderful Christopher this has been an wonderful Christopher this has been an amazing tour uh I would love to try and amazing tour uh I would love to try and amazing tour uh I would love to try and do a little summary and then please keep do a little summary and then please keep do a little summary and then please keep me honest if I uh if I got anything me honest if I uh if I got anything me honest if I uh if I got anything wrong is that all right ready wrong is that all right ready wrong is that all right ready absolutely well absolutely well absolutely well um I think first you explained what is um I think first you explained what is um I think first you explained what is protein and what I took away from this protein and what I took away from this protein and what I took away from this is like fat and carbs are like the fuel is like fat and carbs are like the fuel is like fat and carbs are like the fuel that power us through the day but that power us through the day but that power us through the day but protein actually creates the structure protein actually creates the structure protein actually creates the structure so like everything we're made of so like everything we're made of so like everything we're made of basically comes from these these basically comes from these these basically comes from these these proteins and that they come from these proteins and that they come from these proteins and that they come from these 20 amino acids which I'd never 20 amino acids which I'd never 20 amino acids which I'd never understood what that was before but now understood what that was before but now understood what that was before but now I've got in mind they're sort of like I've got in mind they're sort of like I've got in mind they're sort of like the letters in the alphabet and then I'm the letters in the alphabet and then I'm the letters in the alphabet and then I'm like all these words that get created like all these words that get created like all these words that get created out of these these letters out of these these letters out of these these letters um um um in terms of how much protein we need the in terms of how much protein we need the in terms of how much protein we need the answer is far less than any of us answer is far less than any of us answer is far less than any of us realized or have been led to believe uh realized or have been led to believe uh realized or have been led to believe uh your colleagues at Stanford you know a your colleagues at Stanford you know a your colleagues at Stanford you know a long time ago did these crazy studies of long time ago did these crazy studies of long time ago did these crazy studies of of people sort of wrapped up in suits to of people sort of wrapped up in suits to of people sort of wrapped up in suits to understand exactly how much uh they understand exactly how much uh they understand exactly how much uh they needed and it turns out there's a lot of needed and it turns out there's a lot of needed and it turns out there's a lot of variation between people variation between people variation between people um and I'd love to figure out how we um and I'd love to figure out how we um and I'd love to figure out how we might be able to measure that at home might be able to measure that at home might be able to measure that at home somehow in the future but at the moment somehow in the future but at the moment somehow in the future but at the moment we can't Christopher's shaking his head we can't Christopher's shaking his head we can't Christopher's shaking his head there's always some new technology I there's always some new technology I there's always some new technology I feel but maybe that will make it happen feel but maybe that will make it happen feel but maybe that will make it happen but at the moment you can't measure that but at the moment you can't measure that but at the moment you can't measure that for yourself but what they did is they for yourself but what they did is they for yourself but what they did is they figured out sort of what's the maximum figured out sort of what's the maximum figured out sort of what's the maximum that almost anybody needs and that was that almost anybody needs and that was that almost anybody needs and that was actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and actually only 0.8 grams per kilogram and on average in the US people are eating on average in the US people are eating on average in the US people are eating double that double that double that um uh already which means that they're um uh already which means that they're um uh already which means that they're eating you know far far more in fact eating you know far far more in fact eating you know far far more in fact than they need so they don't need to than they need so they don't need to than they need so they don't need to worry about it and then we talked about worry about it and then we talked about worry about it and then we talked about well what about if you're not eating well what about if you're not eating well what about if you're not eating lots and lots of animal protein you know lots and lots of animal protein you know lots and lots of animal protein you know is that a problem and the answer was is that a problem and the answer was is that a problem and the answer was really not that actually there are all really not that actually there are all really not that actually there are all the amino acids in Plants there are a the amino acids in Plants there are a the amino acids in Plants there are a couple of these amino acids which have couple of these amino acids which have couple of these amino acids which have lower amounts relatively but since we're lower amounts relatively but since we're lower amounts relatively but since we're all eating so much of it it's not really all eating so much of it it's not really all eating so much of it it's not really a problem and I think the final point a problem and I think the final point a problem and I think the final point was almost anything that says like extra was almost anything that says like extra was almost anything that says like extra high protein on it or you know a bar or high protein on it or you know a bar or high protein on it or you know a bar or a shake or any of these things are just a shake or any of these things are just a shake or any of these things are just really bad for you don't eat them and I really bad for you don't eat them and I really bad for you don't eat them and I think Christopher your messages eat think Christopher your messages eat think Christopher your messages eat beans instead beans instead beans instead yep perfect I don't know why it took me yep perfect I don't know why it took me yep perfect I don't know why it took me an hour to say all that when you just an hour to say all that when you just an hour to say all that when you just said it in three minutes which is pretty said it in three minutes which is pretty said it in three minutes which is pretty good well there one critical mistake so good well there one critical mistake so good well there one critical mistake so those those old studies in the blue those those old studies in the blue those those old studies in the blue suits were

more detail in a in a future into in more detail in a in a future podcast but I certainly think you will podcast but I certainly think you will podcast but I certainly think you will have hopefully met a lot of people feel have hopefully met a lot of people feel have hopefully met a lot of people feel more relaxed which is great more relaxed which is great more relaxed which is great um and also probably look very um and also probably look very um and also probably look very differently at these foods that say no differently at these foods that say no differently at these foods that say no

we eat which in turn is centered on dietary which in turn is centered on dietary which in turn is centered on dietary protein so let me for more background share with so let me for more background share with you some other information you some other information you some other information namely in the United States uh we namely in the United States uh we namely in the United States uh we consume the most health care spending is consume the most health care spending is consume the most health care spending is the highest in the world the health care the highest in the world the health care the highest in the world the health care spending per capita spending per capita spending per capita secondly we use the most Pharmaceuticals secondly we use the most Pharmaceuticals secondly we use the most Pharmaceuticals per capita per capita per capita and it should also mention too that the and it should also mention too that the and it should also mention too that the United States is the only country in the United States is the only country in the United States is the only country in the world who advertises on TV prescription world who advertises on TV prescription world who advertises on TV prescription drugs and they do it big time and one more thought to keep in mind and one more thought to keep in mind prescription drug use has side effects prescription drug use has side effects prescription drug use has side effects it's a number four cause of death but it's a number four cause of death but it's a number four cause of death but it's never listed that way that is the background uh and it turns that is the background uh and it turns out our life expectancy one indicator of out our life expectancy one indicator of out our life expectancy one indicator of how well we're doing but life expecting how well we're doing but life expecting how well we're doing but life expecting is not especially is not all that great is not especially is not all that great is not especially is not all that great we're really quite far down the list we're really quite far down the list we're really quite far down the list among countries in the Western World so among countries in the Western World so among countries in the Western World so to speak now when I talk about human and now when I talk about human and planetary health I'm talking about you planetary health I'm talking about you planetary health I'm talking about you know lots of different issues that know lots of different issues that know lots of different issues that people concentrate on usually each people concentrate on usually each people concentrate on usually each working in their own sort of Silo in a working in their own sort of Silo in a working in their own sort of Silo in a sense uh personal health but here's some sense uh personal health but here's some sense uh personal health but here's some of the factors that we can talk about of the factors that we can talk about of the factors that we can talk about you know one by one by one as I've you know one by one by one as I've you know one by one by one as I've already mentioned on the environment uh already mentioned on the environment uh already mentioned on the environment uh we can talk about climate warming the we can talk about climate warming the we can talk about climate warming the Prejudice in it in it turns out again we've got groups of turns out again we've got groups of turns out again we've got groups of people focused on just let's say one people focused on just let's say one people focused on just let's say one thing as if in fact for these different thing as if in fact for these different thing as if in fact for these different problems these have independent causes problems these have independent causes problems these have independent causes I'm going to suggest no I'm going to suggest no I'm going to suggest no we got one overwriting calls I said we got one overwriting calls I said we got one overwriting calls I said almost I could say a single cause almost I could say a single cause almost I could say a single cause it really has to do as I already it really has to do as I already it really has to do as I already indicated with the food that we eat now indicated with the food that we eat now indicated with the food that we eat now on a question concerning the food we eat on a question concerning the food we eat on a question concerning the food we eat um the best way to understand food from um the best way to understand food from um the best way to understand food from my perspective is to understand how it my perspective is to understand how it my perspective is to understand how it worsen the body and what kind of worsen the body and what kind of worsen the body and what kind of response we have from consuming that response we have from consuming that response we have from consuming that food it's an extraordinary complex field food it's an extraordinary complex field food it's an extraordinary complex field I I cannot emphasize that enough I I cannot emphasize that enough I I cannot emphasize that enough there's so much information and people there's

just here in these I'm going to focus just here in these I'm going to focus just here in these two two commentaries on the consumption two two commentaries on the consumption two two commentaries on the consumption of plants not animals of plants not animals of plants not animals now as you keep in mind evidently when now as you keep in mind evidently when now as you keep in mind evidently when we see data especially observational we see data especially observational we see data especially observational data in human populations comparing the data in human populations comparing the data in human populations comparing the consumption of animal food with some consumption of animal food with some consumption of animal food with some kind of disease outcome we should keep kind of disease outcome we should keep kind of disease outcome we should keep in mind that as animal food consumption in mind that as animal food consumption in mind that as animal food consumption increases are the percentage of the diet increases are the percentage of the diet increases are the percentage of the diet plant food goes down so when we see a plant food goes down so when we see a plant food goes down so when we see a relationship with animal protein also relationship with animal protein also relationship with animal protein also showing it in a little bit showing it in a little bit showing it in a little bit that tends to reflect also a decrease in that tends to reflect also a decrease in that tends to reflect also a decrease in consumption of plant foods which have a consumption of plant foods which have a consumption of plant foods which have a lot of wonderful antioxidants and other lot of wonderful antioxidants and other lot of wonderful antioxidants and other substances to prevent disease substances to prevent disease substances to prevent disease you know this is uh when I was going up you know this is uh when I was going up you know this is uh when I was going up on the farm this is what I sort of on the farm this is what I sort of on the farm this is what I sort of learned and most people sort of accepted learned and most people sort of accepted learned and most people sort of accepted this is almost the ideal of North and this is almost the ideal of North and this is almost the ideal of North and diet diet diet quite frankly though we consume this quite frankly though we consume this quite frankly though we consume this food was without knowing it it's almost food was without knowing it it's almost food was without knowing it it's almost unconscious if you will we consume it unconscious if you will we consume it unconscious if you will we consume it because we want to make sure we get because we want to make sure we get because we want to make sure we get enough protein enough protein enough protein I'm going to argue that the protein in I'm going to argue that the protein in I'm going to argue that the protein in animal food animal food animal food uh basically is is so prominent we don't uh basically is is so prominent we don't uh basically is is so prominent we don't even hardly thinking we just take it for even hardly thinking we just take it for even hardly thinking we just take it for granted it's so important I'm going to granted it's so important I'm going to granted it's so important I'm going to call it the driver nutrient

going on that as conversation that's now going on that as conversation that's now going on that as I see it uh primarily is how are we I see it uh primarily is how are we I see it uh primarily is how are we going to meet the demand for production going to meet the demand for production going to meet the demand for production of more animal food presumably because of more animal food presumably because of more animal food presumably because it's so important that's our state it's so important that's our state it's so important that's our state repairs today repairs today repairs today now ethical bash is a step or two now ethical bash is a step or two now ethical bash is a step or two uh to my own sort of intro into this uh to my own sort of intro into this uh to my own sort of intro into this field many years ago field many years ago field many years ago um in graduate school I did a degree I um in graduate school I did a degree I um in graduate school I did a degree I did my doctoral dissertation in fact on did my doctoral dissertation in fact on did my doctoral dissertation in fact on promoting the consumption of more animal promoting the consumption of more animal promoting the consumption of more animal protein more efficiently protein more efficiently protein more efficiently and then and then and then after that in my first after that in my first after that in my first academic academic position academic academic position academic academic position we had a grant from the U.S state we had a grant from the U.S state we had a grant from the U.S state Department there this Virginia Tech Department there this Virginia Tech Department there this Virginia Tech University we are Grant from the state University we are Grant from the state University we are Grant from the state department that was intended to develop department that was intended to develop department that was intended to develop a model for working with malnourished a model for working with malnourished a model for working with malnourished children feeding around their children children feeding around their children children feeding around their children there again the thought was these there again the thought was these there again the thought was these children were malnourished primarily children were malnourished primarily children were malnourished primarily because they weren't getting enough because they weren't getting enough because they weren't getting enough protein so I'm schooled in this idea protein so I'm schooled in this idea protein so I'm schooled in this idea that the more protein the better that the more protein the better that the more protein the better however I saw something in the children however I saw something in the children however I saw something in the children that didn't exactly square with that that didn't exactly square with that that didn't exactly square with that presumption that bias I should say presumption that bias I should say presumption that bias I should say namely I was told by my medical namely I was told by my medical namely I was told by my medical colleagues one day in the Philippines colleagues one day in the Philippines colleagues one day in the Philippines when we were there when we were there when we were there that they were operating some children that they were operating some children that they were operating some children four years of age and younger for liver four years of age and younger for liver four years of age and younger for liver cancer that is really odd I went back to cancer that is really odd I went back to cancer that is really odd I went back to look at some of the nutritional data we look at some of the nutritional data we look at some of the nutritional data we had got the impression that the children had got the impression that the children had got the impression that the children were likely to get the liver cancer were were likely to get the liver cancer were were likely to get the liver cancer were the ones consuming the what were the the ones consuming the what were the the ones consuming the what were the ones from the families consuming the ones from the families consuming the ones from the families consuming the most protein pretty odd more protein most protein pretty odd more protein most protein pretty odd more protein more calcium same makes sense to me but more calcium same makes sense to me but more calcium same makes sense to me but in any case this study then came out in any case this study then came out in any case this study then came out from India now 54 years ago from India now 54 years ago from India now 54 years ago where they were also suggesting that if where they were also suggesting that if where they were also suggesting that if these children were to consume more these children were to consume more these children were to consume more protein they would have less liver protein they would have less liver protein they would have less liver cancer liver cancer is a big problem in cancer liver cancer is a big problem in cancer liver cancer is a big problem in Asia by the way Asia by the way Asia by the way so they did a little study with animals so they did a little study with animals so they did a little study with animals and they got these results animals given and they got these results animals given and they got these results animals given the higher levels of protein 20 percent the higher levels of protein 20 percent the higher levels of protein 20 percent are tall calories are tall calories are tall calories um compared to animals given the lower um compared to animals given the lower um compared to animals given the lower levels of five percent levels of five percent levels of five percent uh both of them both groups were uh both of them both groups were uh both of them both groups were initiated with a carcinogen so as we say initiated with a carcinogen so as we say initiated with a carcinogen so as we say in any case the animals given higher in any case the animals given higher in any case the animals given higher levels of protein they were the ones who levels of protein they were the ones who levels of protein they were the ones who got the cancer got the cancer got the cancer [Music] [Music] [Music] once given lower those did not exactly once given lower those did not exactly once given lower those did not exactly at this what they thought at this what they thought at this what they thought this coincided with some of the this coincided with some of the this coincided with some of the Impressions that I was getting with the Impressions that I was getting with the Impressions that I was getting with the children children children so led to this a really striking so led to this a really striking so led to this a really striking notion increasing protein increasing notion increasing protein increasing notion increasing protein increasing cancer sound crazy cancer sound crazy cancer sound crazy so I came back home to my laboratory at so I came back home to my laboratory at so I came back home to my laboratory at the Virginia Tech and got some money the Virginia Tech and got some money the Virginia Tech and got some money from the NIH a grant that continued to from the NIH a grant that continued to from the NIH a grant that continued to the next 27 years ago well we had a the next 27 years ago well we had a the next 27 years ago well we had a chance to really ask that question chance to really ask that question chance to really ask that question is it possible that animal protein could is it possible that animal protein could is it possible that animal protein could increase cancer and I could just show increase cancer and I could just show increase cancer and I could just show you a ton of studies but I'm going to you a ton of studies but I'm going to you a ton of studies but I'm going to just focus on one for to to because it just focus on one for to to because it just focus on one for to to because it really really really convinced me that there's something here convinced me that there's something here convinced me that there's something here I mean I was inclined to really doubt I mean I was inclined to really doubt I mean I was inclined to really doubt this but we did this I want to show you this but we did this I want to show you this but we did this I want to show you what we did what we did what we did this is the growth of in animals this is the growth of in animals this is the growth of in animals experimental rats this is the growth of experimental rats this is the growth of experimental rats this is the growth of cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 cancer over the first 12 weeks for 12 weeks weeks weeks animals fed 20 protein with the Indian animals fed 20 protein with the Indian animals fed 20 protein with the Indian workers did and you can see it's one workers did and you can see it's one workers did and you can see it's one brother well animals give it five brother well animals give it five brother well animals give it five percent did not let me write there is it percent did not let me write there is it percent did not let me write there is it was affirmation and as I said what the was affirmation and as I said what the was affirmation and as I said what the Indian workers have done if you will but Indian workers have done if you will but Indian workers have done if you will but then we did something more that was then we did something more that was then we did something more that was really striking really striking really striking I wanted to see what would happen if we I wanted to see what would happen if we I wanted to see what would happen if we switched the dice during that 12-week switched the dice during that 12-week switched the dice during that 12-week period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and period 20 5 Factor 20 back to five and vice versa this is just one vice versa this is just one vice versa this is just one representation of that representation of that representation of that and what results breaking we could and what results breaking we could and what results breaking we could control cancer development simply by control cancer development simply by control cancer development simply by adjusting this nutrient intake adjusting this nutrient intake adjusting this nutrient intake suggesting that nutrition might be suggesting that nutrition might be suggesting that nutrition might be important in controlling whether or not important in controlling whether or not important in controlling whether or not cancer works or not was really quite cancer works or not was really quite cancer works or not was really quite dramatic we did this kind of study in dramatic we did this kind of study in dramatic we did this kind of study in many different ways and I can tell you many different ways and I can tell you many different ways and I can tell you it's there it's true it's there it's true it's there it's true so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh so it suggested a rather Grand idea uh at that time Now supported I think by at that time Now supported I think by at that time Now supported I think by more information namely a nutrition more information namely a nutrition more information namely a nutrition rather than genes controls cancer rather than genes controls cancer rather than genes controls cancer development uh what a revelation that development uh what a revelation that development uh what a revelation that was was was turned out is that not only that the turned out is that not only that the turned out is that not only that the protein we were using was animal-based protein we were using was animal-based protein we were using was animal-based it was small things it was protein of it was small things it was protein of it was small things it was protein of cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cow's milk it was born of Levine milking cows and and here casein was the one cows and and here casein was the one cows and and here casein was the one that was turning the cancer on that was turning the cancer on that was turning the cancer on a little bit later we tried to see what a little bit later we tried to see what a little bit later we tried to see what not so plant proteins like soy and we not so plant proteins like soy and we not so plant proteins like soy and we could do that didn't Infuse experiments could do that didn't Infuse experiments could do that didn't Infuse experiments on that different students were involved on that different students were involved on that different students were involved in it and sodium protein does not in it and sodium protein does not in it and sodium protein does not increase cancer development even when increase cancer development even when increase cancer development even when fed at the 20 level fed at the 20 level fed at the 20 level so it really puts a finger pointer at so it really puts a finger pointer at so it really puts a finger pointer at the finger right at animal protein as the finger right at animal protein as the finger right at animal protein as being the problem turning into cancer being the problem turning into cancer being the problem turning into cancer that being said it also seemed to apply that being said it also seemed to apply that being said it also seemed to apply to other animal proteins in general you to other animal proteins in general you to other animal proteins in general you know getting more into that in my second know getting more into that in my second know getting more into that in my second commentary but in any case if animal commentary but in any case if animal commentary but in any case if animal proteins cause cancer proteins cause cancer proteins cause cancer the notion occurred to me this is back the notion occurred to me this is back the notion occurred to me this is back in the 1980s in the 1980s in the 1980s the notion occurred to me that maybe the notion occurred to me that maybe the notion occurred to me that maybe this might apply to other diseases as this might apply to other diseases as this might apply to other diseases as well and similarly Betty plant Foods well and similarly Betty plant Foods well and similarly Betty plant Foods particular fruits is in this case that particular fruits is in this case that particular fruits is in this case that might tend to prevent that might tend to prevent that might tend to prevent that so with that in mind uh still not so with that in mind uh still not so with that in mind uh still not totally convinced that this animal totally convinced that this animal totally convinced that this animal protein affects what's Real uh I wanted protein affects what's Real uh I wanted protein affects what's Real uh I wanted to know what the mechanism was I spent to know what the mechanism was I spent to know what the mechanism was I spent the first 10 12 years of my career the first 10 12 years of my career the first 10 12 years of my career actually formally in as a professional actually formally in as a professional actually formally in as a professional in the pharmacology community in the pharmacology community in the pharmacology community uh you know all about drugs and how to uh you know all about drugs and how to uh you know all about drugs and how to use drugs and stuff like that so I'm use drugs and stuff like that so I'm use drugs and stuff like that so I'm very conscious was at that time of what very conscious was at that time of what very conscious was at that time of what drugs can do and here's here's the drugs can do and here's here's the drugs can do and here's here's the thought we tend to have in research of thought we tend to have in research of thought we tend to have in research of this kind this kind this kind if we see something we don't like animal if we see something we don't like animal if we see something we don't like animal protein causes cancer maybe we could protein causes cancer maybe we could protein causes cancer maybe we could find a mechanism for that effect that find a mechanism for that effect that find a mechanism for that effect that would lend itself to the development of would lend itself to the development of would lend itself to the development of a drug to block it there's something a drug to block it there's something a drug to block it there's something like statins being used about you know like statins being used about you know like statins being used about you know the the enzyme mechanism that is the the enzyme mechanism that is the the enzyme mechanism that is associated with heart disease so that associated with heart disease so that associated with heart disease so that was the thought maybe we could find the was the thought maybe we could find the was the thought maybe we could find the mechanism so we set about looking for mechanism so we set about looking for mechanism so we set about looking for mechanisms these studies went over a mechanisms these studies went over a mechanisms these studies went over a period went on over a period at least period went on over a period at least period went on over a period at least got 10 12 years or so got 10 12 years or so got 10 12 years or so and I kept looking for the mechanism and I kept looking for the mechanism and I kept looking for the mechanism they Mack Henderson that might account they Mack Henderson that might account they Mack Henderson that might account for this and and making those kind of for this and and making those kind of for this and and making those kind of studies we tended to in experimental studies we tended to in experimental studies we tended to in experimental cancer research we tended to think of cancer research we tended to think of cancer research we tended to think of cancerous then composed of three stages cancerous then composed of three stages cancerous then composed of three stages the first date is initiation that's when the first date is initiation that's when the first date is initiation that's when the cancer is forming from a mutation of the cancer is forming from a mutation of the cancer is forming from a mutation of mutated genes secondly we talk about a mutated genes secondly we talk about a mutated genes secondly we talk about a stage that takes a much longer period of stage that takes a much longer period of stage that takes a much longer period of time for promotion that's when the new time for promotion that's when the new time for promotion that's when the new cancer cells was formed then are divided cancer cells was formed then are divided cancer cells was formed then are divided and divided dividing and growing into and divided dividing and growing into and divided dividing and growing into tumors well and then the third stage is tumors well and then the third stage is tumors well and then the third stage is when the cancer is breaking away from when the cancer is breaking away from when the cancer is breaking away from this tissue of origin and going this tissue of origin and going this tissue of origin and going someplace else we call it metastasis and someplace else we call it metastasis and someplace else we call it metastasis and that is called progression so with that that is called progression so with that that is called progression so with that in mind in mind in mind I wanted to say you know what is the I wanted to say you know what is the I wanted to say you know what is the mechanism so we started out early in the mechanism so we started out early in the mechanism so we started out early in the simplest level looking for a mechanism simplest level looking for a mechanism simplest level looking for a mechanism in the first stage in the first stage in the first stage um and that and then we started finding um and that and then we started finding um and that and then we started finding Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism Aziza mechanisms usually one mechanism multiplied the entire doctoral multiplied the entire doctoral multiplied the entire doctoral dissertation of the student because dissertation of the student because dissertation of the student because there's a lot of work doing these kind there's a lot of work doing these kind there's a lot of work doing these kind of things of things of things in any case without a number of in any case without a number of in any case without a number of mechanisms that seem to be involved in mechanisms that seem to be involved in mechanisms that seem to be involved in initiation initiating the cancer initiation initiating the cancer initiation initiating the cancer the high protein diet could increase the the high protein diet could increase the the high protein diet could increase the rate of entry into of the car citizens rate of entry into of the car citizens rate of entry into of the car citizens into the cell oh that's pretty important into the cell oh that's pretty important into the cell oh that's pretty important when a course sentences get inside when a course sentences get inside when a course sentences get inside themselves they are metabolized by a themselves they are metabolized by a themselves they are metabolized by a mixed function oxidase enzyme system and mixed function oxidase enzyme system and mixed function oxidase enzyme system and methyl methyl methyl and what we found there was that and by and what we found there was that and by and what we found there was that and by the way it's metabolized to produce a the way it's metabolized to produce a the way it's metabolized to produce a product that's very reactive that then product that's very reactive that then product that's very reactive that then binds to the DNA of genes that's what binds to the DNA of genes that's what binds to the DNA of genes that's what indications occur what we found was that indications occur what we found was that indications occur what we found was that the high animal protein consumption the high animal protein consumption the high animal protein consumption increased the amount of enzyme being increased the amount of enzyme being increased the amount of enzyme being synthesized it increases rearrassed the synthesized it increases rearrassed the synthesized it increases rearrassed the structure so it became more accurate and structure so it became more accurate and structure so it became more accurate and then in turn it increased The Binding of then in turn it increased The Binding of then in turn it increased The Binding of the product that really reactive product the product that really reactive product the product that really reactive product of the imitation it increased the of the imitation it increased the of the imitation it increased the product to the DNA which was the product to the DNA which was the product to the DNA which was the beginning of limitation beginning of limitation beginning of limitation but then we have a incidentally a repair but then we have a incidentally a repair but then we have a incidentally a repair mechanism that keeps that under control mechanism that keeps that under control mechanism that keeps that under control if you will it's working all the time in if you will it's working all the time in if you will it's working all the time in our bodies it's called DNA repair what our bodies it's called DNA repair what our bodies it's called DNA repair what we found there was that high protein we found there was that high protein we found there was that high protein diet actually turned it off I mean the diet actually turned it off I mean the diet actually turned it off I mean the thing that's been protecting us the high thing that's been protecting us the high thing that's been protecting us the high protein does turn it off so there's a protein does turn it off so there's a protein does turn it off so there's a bunch of mechanisms in that first stage bunch of mechanisms in that first stage bunch of mechanisms in that first stage I'm getting a little bit frustrated I'm getting a little bit frustrated I'm getting a little bit frustrated maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're maybe I'm not sure what we're what we're looking at here by this time looking at here by this time looking at here by this time so we turned her attention to the second so we turned her attention to the second so we turned her attention to the second stage now the second stage you'll notice stage now the second stage you'll notice stage now the second stage you'll notice I put arrows reversible arrows as a I put arrows reversible arrows as a I put arrows reversible arrows as a result of the research that we were result of the research that we were result of the research that we were doing turning cancer involved doing turning cancer involved doing turning cancer involved um and so in the second stage we started um and so in the second stage we started um and so in the second stage we started looking for mechanisms again we found a looking for mechanisms again we found a looking for mechanisms again we found a bunch of mechanisms uh one here in bunch of mechanisms uh one here in bunch of mechanisms uh one here in yellow that was a good one that's called yellow that was a good one that's called yellow that was a good one that's called natural killer cell activity no these natural killer cell activity no these natural killer cell activity no these are done by the way it's about 25 30 are done by the way it's about 25 30 are done by the way it's about 25 30 years ago natural killer cells now are years ago natural killer cells now are years ago natural killer cells now are the topic of discussion these days for the topic of discussion these days for the topic of discussion these days for trying to figure out a drug that enhance trying to figure out a drug that enhance trying to figure out a drug that enhance their activity but in any case their activity but in any case their activity but in any case we found that the high protein diet we found that the high protein diet we found that the high protein diet decreased decreased decreased natural killer cells the good stuff and natural killer cells the good stuff and natural killer cells the good stuff and increase the rate at which cells divide increase the rate at which cells divide increase the rate at which cells divide it increased the ability of the of the it increased the ability of the of the it increased the ability of the of the uh the protein increased the ability to uh the protein increased the ability to uh the protein increased the ability to approaching the form very reactive approaching the form very reactive approaching the form very reactive compounds called ocean radicals compounds called ocean radicals compounds called ocean radicals caution caution caution pre-reactive oxygen species something I pre-reactive oxygen species something I pre-reactive oxygen species something I can say it also did some of the can say it also did some of the can say it also did some of the increased the production of hormone and increased the production of hormone and increased the production of hormone and altered calories so we here we had all altered calories so we here we had all altered calories so we here we had all these mechanisms just kept popping up these mechanisms just kept popping up these mechanisms just kept popping up every time that and I said this was every time that and I said this was every time that and I said this was going over a period at least 10 12 even going over a period at least 10 12 even going over a period at least 10 12 even even longer I guess for doing this kind even longer I guess for doing this kind even longer I guess for doing this kind of research so in a summary we found of research so in a summary we found of research so in a summary we found that eight of these mechanisms uh that eight of these mechanisms uh that eight of these mechanisms uh increased cancer uh and two of them that increased cancer uh and two of them that increased cancer uh and two of them that were good and they were turned off so we were good and they were turned off so we were good and they were turned off so we got 10 mechanisms wow got 10 mechanisms wow got 10 mechanisms wow all 10 worked in the unison all 10 worked in the unison all 10 worked in the unison to increase cancer that was the thought to increase cancer that was the thought to increase cancer that was the thought that I found really quite remarkable that I found really quite remarkable that I found really quite remarkable it's not about one mechanism all of a it's not about one mechanism all of a it's not about one mechanism all of a sudden I started losing my interest in sudden I started losing my interest in sudden I started losing my interest in the idea that there was one mechanism the idea that there was one mechanism the idea that there was one mechanism that might lend itself to let's say that might lend itself to let's say that might lend itself to let's say pharmacologic treatment pharmacologic treatment pharmacologic treatment instead there's nutrition was just instead there's nutrition was just instead there's nutrition was just everything was just going wrong at the everything was just going wrong at the everything was just going wrong at the same time we we've worked on 10 I could same time we we've worked on 10 I could same time we we've worked on 10 I could probably put up another couple here that probably put up another couple here that probably put up another couple here that we had information on I'm sure now is we had information on I'm sure now is we had information on I'm sure now is far more than that far more than that far more than that but the point is the high protein diet but the point is the high protein diet but the point is the high protein diet just changed all these mechanisms almost just changed all these mechanisms almost just changed all these mechanisms almost simultaneously to do the same thing simultaneously to do the same thing simultaneously to do the same thing in unison in unison in unison so as far as drug intervention is so as far as drug intervention is so as far as drug intervention is concerned forget it that's not the way concerned forget it that's not the way concerned forget it that's not the way to solve the problem to solve the problem to solve the problem it'll bring to your attention the use of it'll bring to your attention the use of it'll bring to your attention the use of statins for example that's been invented statins for example that's been invented statins for example that's been invented created billions of dollars of profit created billions of dollars of profit created billions of dollars of profit that are being used supposedly to that are being used supposedly to that are being used supposedly to control heart disease control heart disease control heart disease doesn't work that way not like that does doesn't work that way not like that does doesn't work that way not like that does so which mechanism which drug that was a so which mechanism which drug that was a so which mechanism which drug that was a dead end Street yeah I know I want to dead end Street yeah I know I want to dead end Street yeah I know I want to just tell you one more story in this just tell you one more story in this just tell you one more story in this first presentation that kind of fit in first presentation that kind of fit in first presentation that kind of fit in pretty well with what I was learning pretty well with what I was learning pretty well with what I was learning about all these mechanisms of working about all these mechanisms of working about all these mechanisms of working together as animal protein that was together as animal protein that was together as animal protein that was doing it not plant protein doing it not plant protein doing it not plant protein recently I had a chance to go back into recently I had a chance to go back into recently I had a chance to go back into the literature and look at let's say the literature and look at let's say the literature and look at let's say some researchers that may have compared some researchers that may have compared some researchers that may have compared animal protein intake against some animal protein intake against some animal protein intake against some disease disease disease and found quite a few cure or something and found quite a few cure or something and found quite a few cure or something here's a plot of a researcher some years here's a plot of a researcher some years here's a plot of a researcher some years ago ago ago who found that increasing among you know who found that increasing among you know who found that increasing among you know these are different countries okay these are different countries okay these are different countries okay United States is right there you can see United States is right there you can see United States is right there you can see among different countries you can see as among different countries you can see as among different countries you can see as daily animal protein consumption goes up daily animal protein consumption goes up daily animal protein consumption goes up renal cancer goes up real cancer renal cancer goes up real cancer renal cancer goes up real cancer incidence that's kidney cancer incidence that's kidney cancer incidence that's kidney cancer uh I drew that line there myself uh I drew that line there myself uh I drew that line there myself um and it turns out that it was a um and it turns out that it was a um and it turns out that it was a according to an algorithm according to an algorithm according to an algorithm characteristics or conditions if you characteristics or conditions if you characteristics or conditions if you will will will um in any case what we see here is is um in any case what we see here is is um in any case what we see here is is almost a straight-line relationship almost a straight-line relationship almost a straight-line relationship really impressive really impressive really impressive in other words decrease in animal in other words decrease in animal in other words decrease in animal protection consumption brings to kidney protection consumption brings to kidney protection consumption brings to kidney cancer risk down to just above zero cancer risk down to just above zero cancer risk down to just above zero here's another one here's a paper here's another one here's a paper here's another one here's a paper published in 1959 by a member of a published in 1959 by a member of a published in 1959 by a member of a jolliff an older man at the time when I jolliff an older man at the time when I jolliff an older man at the time when I was a registered I I actually met him was a registered I I actually met him was a registered I I actually met him and he what he showed was that and he what he showed was that and he what he showed was that increasing protein consumption for increasing protein consumption for increasing protein consumption for different countries so just by numbers different countries so just by numbers different countries so just by numbers here increasing protein increased here increasing protein increased here increasing protein increased heart disease deaths again I draw the heart disease deaths again I draw the heart disease deaths again I draw the line through there and what I get is line through there and what I get is line through there and what I get is this just like that this just like that this just like that here's another one it's more recent here's another one it's more recent here's another one it's more recent times here's a relationship between times here's a relationship between times here's a relationship between non-fat milk consumption and prostate non-fat milk consumption and prostate non-fat milk consumption and prostate cancer wow that line just come right cancer wow that line just come right cancer wow that line just come right down closer to the zero there you have down closer to the zero there you have down closer to the zero there you have it right there and so it looks like not it right there and so it looks like not it right there and so it looks like not that milk skim milk if you will is that milk skim milk if you will is that milk skim milk if you will is better than whole milk that's what that better than whole milk that's what that better than whole milk that's what that suggests suggests suggests we did that on the farm by the way uh we did that on the farm by the way uh we did that on the farm by the way uh when it first came out about fat we were when it first came out about fat we were when it first came out about fat we were basically Central Fusion or melting basically Central Fusion or melting basically Central Fusion or melting making skim milk but that's set that making skim milk but that's set that making skim milk but that's set that aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat aside non-fat milk increasing non-fat skim milk the good stuff a lot of people skim milk the good stuff a lot of people skim milk the good stuff a lot of people thought It's associated with prostate thought It's associated with prostate thought It's associated with prostate cancer wow cancer wow cancer wow here's one my good friend from the here's one my good friend from the here's one my good friend from the University of Western Ontario in Canada University of Western Ontario in Canada University of Western Ontario in Canada Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of Ken Carroll did this he got a bunch of countries and he was looking at the risk countries and he was looking at the risk countries and he was looking at the risk to the dietary infection on the breast to the dietary infection on the breast to the dietary infection on the breast cancer or mortality for a different cancer or mortality for a different cancer or mortality for a different watches of countries watches of countries watches of countries and he concluded that as total fat and he concluded that as total fat and he concluded that as total fat increases I've come to that ammonia the increases I've come to that ammonia the increases I've come to that ammonia the the risk of drug breast cancer went up the risk of drug breast cancer went up the risk of drug breast cancer went up but more particularly it was a saturated but more particularly it was a saturated but more particularly it was a saturated fat common in animal Foods that's where fat common in animal Foods that's where fat common in animal Foods that's where the line really occurred very impressive the line really occurred very impressive the line really occurred very impressive once again the lines from weight down once again the lines from weight down once again the lines from weight down through almost there if you will through almost there if you will through almost there if you will there's another one there's another one there's another one this is reversing the axis the the this is reversing the axis the the this is reversing the axis the the cholesterol the dietary things on the cholesterol the dietary things on the cholesterol the dietary things on the y-axis in this case but what it shows is y-axis in this case but what it shows is y-axis in this case but what it shows is that again heart disease risk is that again heart disease risk is that again heart disease risk is increased for these different countries increased for these different countries increased for these different countries there's the U.S way up here any priest there's the U.S way up here any priest there's the U.S way up here any priest with all these countries has cholesterol with all these countries has cholesterol with all these countries has cholesterol intake goes up now cholesterol comes intake goes up now cholesterol comes intake goes up now cholesterol comes from animal food only right from animal food only right from animal food only right so we've got now cholesterol calcium so we've got now cholesterol calcium so we've got now cholesterol calcium heart disease it looks like heart disease it looks like heart disease it looks like um here's one for meat consumption and um here's one for meat consumption and um here's one for meat consumption and colon cancer still another research colon cancer still another research colon cancer still another research group group group here's one for uterine cancer and total here's one for uterine cancer and total here's one for uterine cancer and total fat it's like total fat then it tend to fat it's like total fat then it tend to fat it's like total fat then it tend to reflects uh animal food consumption by reflects uh animal food consumption by reflects uh animal food consumption by the way for different countries the way for different countries the way for different countries and finally and finally and finally this impression appearance namely all this impression appearance namely all this impression appearance namely all these different things whether it's meat these

just just export it into further questions as to what's special further questions as to what's special further questions as to what's special about that particular kind of flu or about that particular kind of flu or about that particular kind of flu or Newton Newton Newton so I call them animal protein surgery so I call them animal protein surgery so I call them animal protein surgery it's all shown the same thing it's all shown the same thing it's all shown the same thing so what's common to them what's Karma so what's common to them what's Karma so what's common to them what's Karma job is the protein job is the protein job is the protein is animal protein so on that question by is animal protein so on that question by is animal protein so on that question by the way uh my friend tantaro was he was the way uh my friend tantaro was he was the way uh my friend tantaro was he was looking at the saturated fat versus looking at the saturated fat versus looking at the saturated fat versus breast cancer thing he also had breast cancer thing he also had breast cancer thing he also had information on the conceptual plant information on the conceptual plant information on the conceptual plant protein he didn't call it plant protein protein he didn't call it plant protein protein he didn't call it plant protein to call it unsaturated fat to call it unsaturated fat to call it unsaturated fat but there's no relationship no but there's no relationship no but there's no relationship no relationship so this team this these relationship so this team this these relationship so this team this these linear regressions seem to be uh linear regressions seem to be uh linear regressions seem to be uh basically four animal food not plant for basically four animal food not plant for basically four animal food not plant for animal protein in particular animal protein in particular animal protein in particular so let me leave that with you for the so let me leave that with you for the so let me leave that with you for the moment moment moment um and uh just remind us that what what um and uh just remind us that what what um and uh just remind us that what what an attempted

the and the food we eat it causes the and the food we eat it causes the problems is characterized by the problems is characterized by the problems is characterized by the fascination that we have for animal fascination that we have for animal fascination that we have for animal protein thank you okay back again uh for the second half okay back again uh for the second half of this commentary uh and before getting of this commentary uh and before getting of this commentary uh and before getting into the comments here uh let me just into the comments here uh let me just into the comments here uh let me just briefly just highlight a couple of briefly just highlight a couple of briefly just highlight a couple of points I was tempted to make in the points I was tempted to make in the points I was tempted to make in the first part a few a few points that we first part a few a few points that we first part a few a few points that we might consider so far might consider so far might consider so far um first um first um first um as I mentioned I'm really addressing um as I mentioned I'm really addressing um as I mentioned I'm really addressing a an issue having to do with multiple a an issue having to do with multiple a an issue having to do with multiple problems having to do with human health problems having to do with human health problems having to do with human health or human and planetary health and or human and planetary health and or human and planetary health and suggesting in fact to working toward the suggesting in fact to working toward the suggesting in fact to working toward the idea that there's one main cause the idea that there's one main cause the idea that there's one main cause the possible one main solution to solving is possible one main solution to solving is possible one main solution to solving is very complicated set of problems very complicated set of problems very complicated set of problems and I'm suggesting too as she already and I'm suggesting too as she already and I'm suggesting too as she already heard from the first commentary I'm heard from the first commentary I'm heard from the first commentary I'm suggesting that it's our fascination suggesting that it's our fascination suggesting that it's our fascination or long-time fascination with high or long-time fascination with high or long-time fascination with high quality animal protein quality animal protein quality animal protein you know a lot of people think protein you know a lot of people think protein you know a lot of people think protein is just in animals it's not quite but at is just in animals it's not quite but at is just in animals it's not quite but at least it's high quality fascination with least it's high quality fascination with least it's high quality fascination with high quality animal protein and I'm high quality animal protein and I'm high quality animal protein and I'm going to say that this is the main going to say that this is the main going to say that this is the main driver driver driver of food production of food production of food production and food shorts and food shorts and food shorts for well over a century for well over a century for well over a century and I want to talk about that the and I want to talk about that the and I want to talk about that the consequences of that Fascination example consequences of that Fascination example consequences of that Fascination example of protein if the world of protein if the world of protein if the world I want to talk a little bit about the I want to talk a little bit about the I want to talk a little bit about the origin the consequences of this origin the consequences of this origin the consequences of this fascination fascination fascination On the Origin I want to go back to On the Origin I want to go back to On the Origin I want to go back to Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who Mulder in 1839 at Dutch chemist who discovered protein well he was he had uh discovered protein well he was he had uh discovered protein well he was he had uh he was doing a dog experiment actually he was doing a dog experiment actually he was doing a dog experiment actually and the dog was eating meat and he and the dog was eating meat and he and the dog was eating meat and he realized that the dog had to have some realized that the dog had to have some realized that the dog had to have some meat or would die or suffer problems and meat or would die or suffer problems and meat or would die or suffer problems and so he said he's a chemist he set out to so he said he's a chemist he set out to so he said he's a chemist he set out to try to find in there or something in try to find in there or something in try to find in there or something in there they might be able to isolate he there they might be able to isolate he there they might be able to isolate he found a compound a material had to give found a compound a material had to give found a compound a material had to give it a name it a name it a name he gave it a name after the Greek word he gave it a name after the Greek word he gave it a name after the Greek word proteos proteos proteos which means our Prime importance so in a which means our Prime importance so in a which means our Prime importance so in a sense the word

important guy it's a pretty important guy so now let me turn to this question so now let me turn to this question so now let me turn to this question concerning what is perfect quality I concerning what is perfect quality I concerning what is perfect quality I said you know people we tend to think said you know people we tend to think said you know people we tend to think the protein the protein the protein that's quality and the quality protein that's quality and the quality protein that's quality and the quality protein high quality protein is in animal Foods high quality protein is in animal Foods high quality protein is in animal Foods I mean for many years for a lot of I mean for many years for a lot of I mean for many years for a lot of people thought protein only came from people thought protein only came from people thought protein only came from animal Foods animal Foods animal Foods benship was learned in the late 1800s benship was learned in the late 1800s benship was learned in the late 1800s early 1900s finds that protein too yeah early 1900s finds that protein too yeah early 1900s finds that protein too yeah over over that's not high quality let me over over that's not high quality let me over over that's not high quality let me go explore that story through that story go explore that story through that story go explore that story through that story with it with it with it high quality a really important concept high quality a really important concept high quality a really important concept people don't necessarily they haven't people don't necessarily they haven't people don't necessarily they haven't put it in their minds they don't put it in their minds they don't put it in their minds they don't necessarily you know think about it on a necessarily you know think about it on a necessarily you know think about it on a daily basis that's great to say it's daily basis that's great to say it's daily basis that's great to say it's really almost an unconscious really almost an unconscious really almost an unconscious subconscious kind of motion but high subconscious kind of motion but high subconscious kind of motion but high quality means in a laboratory means more quality means in a laboratory means more quality means in a laboratory means more dietary protein in a test period more dietary protein in a test period more dietary protein in a test period more dietary protein being retained by the dietary protein being retained by the dietary protein being retained by the body in a set period of time except it's body in a set period of time except it's body in a set period of time except it's kind of certain conditions kind of certain conditions kind of certain conditions and that in turn relates to a concept we and that in turn relates to a concept we and that in turn relates to a concept we call biological value that actually is call biological value that actually is call biological value that actually is what I really redid on myself in my what I really redid on myself in my what I really redid on myself in my inductive dissertation in years ago this inductive dissertation in years ago this inductive dissertation in years ago this whole concept of you know trying to find whole concept of you know trying to find whole concept of you know trying to find a protein that has the highest a protein that has the highest a protein that has the highest biological value or equality biological value or equality biological value or equality animal proteins by the way and I can't animal proteins by the way and I can't animal proteins by the way and I can't get into all the details here but it's get into all the details here but it's get into all the details here but it's convincingly I'll show you this animal convincingly I'll show you this animal convincingly I'll show you this animal proteins retain more of the protein they proteins retain more of the protein they proteins retain more of the protein they consume okay that's referred to as high consume okay that's referred to as high consume okay that's referred to as high quality plant proteins no reason as much quality plant proteins no reason as much quality plant proteins no reason as much they're low quality so animal proteins they're low quality so animal proteins they're low quality so animal proteins are high quality plant proteins are for are high quality plant proteins are for are high quality plant proteins are for low carbons everybody was quality right low carbons everybody was quality right low carbons everybody was quality right well that kind of equipment or well that kind of equipment or well that kind of equipment or Consciousness and uh so if you really Consciousness and uh so if you really Consciousness and uh so if you really want to get real protein eat animal want to get real protein eat animal want to get real protein eat animal protein uh if you don't want to do that protein uh if you don't want to do that protein uh if you don't want to do that then create the plant proteins in such a then create the plant proteins in such a then create the plant proteins in such a way that you get high quality okay way that you get high quality okay way that you get high quality okay that's been with us forever that's been with us forever that's been with us forever so this origin of the concept of high so this origin of the concept of high so this origin of the concept of high quality uh actually arose formally from quality uh actually arose formally from quality uh actually arose formally from a professor at the University of a professor at the University of a professor at the University of Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 Illinois H.H Mitchell published in 1924 and uh he is titled a message for and uh he is titled a message for and uh he is titled a message for determine the biological value of determine the biological value of determine the biological value of protein high quality well protein high quality well protein high quality well so it means more protein being retained so it means more protein being retained so it means more protein being retained well for what purpose well well for what purpose well well for what purpose well it actually related more protein is it actually related more protein is it actually related more protein is being retained by a given amount of being retained by a given amount of being retained by a given amount of protein The Bachelor rate of body weight protein The Bachelor rate of body weight protein The Bachelor rate of body weight gain right so it looked good growth go gain right so it looked good growth go gain right so it looked good growth go animals faster Bradley Sperma showed animals faster Bradley Sperma showed animals faster Bradley Sperma showed that Pegasus and so forth that in turn that Pegasus and so forth that in turn that Pegasus and so forth that in turn you know speeding up growths obviously you know speeding up growths obviously you know speeding up growths obviously means more profit for the means more profit for the means more profit for the livestock-based agriculture good deal so livestock-based agriculture good deal so livestock-based agriculture good deal so you want to stick to protein as high you want to stick to protein as high you want to stick to protein as high quality whoops but there's a problem with that whoops but there's a problem with that thought it's been around for ever it's thought it's been around for ever it's thought it's been around for ever it's in our Consciousness we don't think in our Consciousness we don't think in our Consciousness we don't think about it the public never thinks about about it the public never thinks about about it the public never thinks about it quite frankly that way but they just it quite frankly that way but they just it quite frankly that way but they just know whose protein know whose protein know whose protein it turns out in a more recent times and it turns out in a more recent times and it turns out in a more recent times and not so just reasons there's a couple of not so just reasons there's a couple of not so just reasons there's a couple of cases here quite a long time ago it cases here quite a long time ago it cases here quite a long time ago it turns out that the more protein being turns out that the more protein being turns out that the more protein being retained also does some other things retained also does some other things retained also does some other things look look look the higher the retention it increases the higher the retention it increases the higher the retention it increases growth hormone growth hormone growth

relation turned to breast hormone that relation turned to breast cancer earlier Asian men are more more cancer earlier Asian men are more more cancer earlier Asian men are more more urine tests and so forth so higher urine tests and so forth so higher urine tests and so forth so higher protein than retained means more growth protein than retained means more growth protein than retained means more growth hormone hormone hormone more estrogen it also turns on the more estrogen it also turns on the more estrogen it also turns on the production of so-called free radicals production of so-called

group at University of Michigan and then group at University of Michigan and then group at University of Michigan and then again in 1926 and it turns out that the again in 1926 and it turns out that the again in 1926 and it turns out that the real cause of increasing cholesterol and real cause of increasing cholesterol and real cause of increasing cholesterol and the heart disease that comes along with the heart disease that comes along with the heart disease that comes along with it is protein it's animal protein so it is protein it's animal protein so it is protein it's animal protein so that increases our disease okay that increases our disease okay that increases our disease okay incidentally that was summarized in 1926 incidentally that was summarized in 1926 incidentally that was summarized in 1926 as I just said 23 26 that's the time as I just said 23 26 that's the time as I just said 23 26 that's the time when Mitchell came along in Illinois when Mitchell came along in

here first off going to be showing here first off the minimum amount of protein that we the minimum amount of protein that we the minimum amount of protein that we need and this was first learned more or need and this was first learned more or need and this was first learned more or less developed officially in the early less developed officially in the early less developed officially in the early 1940s the minimum amount of protein we 1940s the minimum amount of protein we 1940s the minimum amount of protein we need is about five to six percent of need is about five to six percent of need is about five to six percent of tenants that's all tenants that's all tenants that's all but that uh experimental result uh was but that uh experimental result uh was but that uh experimental result uh was then increased by a couple of standard then increased by a couple of standard then increased by a couple of standard deviations to make sure everybody in the deviations to make sure everybody in the deviations to make sure everybody in the protein and so that's what gave rise to protein and so that's what gave rise to protein and so that's what gave rise to the recommended dietary allowance okay the recommended dietary allowance okay the recommended dietary allowance okay serd that's the one everybody looks at serd that's the one everybody looks at serd that's the one everybody looks at thinks about it they think about any of thinks about it they think about any of thinks about it they think about any of this that's not the minimum amount we this that's not the minimum amount we this that's not the minimum amount we need by the way the minimum that is here need by the way the minimum that is here need by the way the minimum that is here this is the recommended level this is this

presentation of the risk of disease that presentation of the risk of disease that presentation of the risk of disease that occurs you know by increasing protein occurs you know by increasing protein occurs you know by increasing protein consumption during this range here consumption during this range here consumption during this range here mostly from animal Foods we can expect mostly from animal Foods we can expect mostly from animal Foods we can expect to see an increase just like that in to see an increase just like that in to see an increase just like that in chronic disease risks there it is pretty chronic disease risks there it is pretty chronic disease risks there it is pretty plain straightforward quite simple plain straightforward quite simple plain straightforward quite simple and I might point out by the way that we and I might point out by the way that we and I might point out by the way that we only need 9 10 protein or so like that only need 9 10 protein or so like that only need 9 10 protein or so like that that's enough that's enough that's enough you know Whole Food plant-based diets you know Whole Food plant-based diets you know Whole Food plant-based diets provide all the protein we need at the provide all the protein we need at the provide all the protein we need at the right time it's the right time we do not right time it's the right time we do not

dietary guidelines uh in the United States are updated uh in the United States are updated uh in the United States are updated every five years with the committee every five years with the committee every five years with the committee uh usually it's the amount of protein uh usually it's the amount of protein uh usually it's the amount of protein needed in other nutrients needed are needed in other nutrients needed are needed in other nutrients needed are framed by the national academic science framed by the national academic science framed by the national academic science and then that's passed off to the doctor and then that's passed off to the doctor and then that's passed off to the doctor to the usaid doctor guidelines and so to the usaid doctor guidelines and so to the usaid doctor guidelines and so this what I'm showing you here right now this what I'm showing you here right now this what I'm showing you here right now in in 2002 a decision was made by the in in 2002 a decision was made by the in in 2002 a decision was made by the committee that determines how much committee that determines how much committee that determines how much nutrients you should have they want to nutrients you should have they want to nutrients you should have they want to sit an upper limit for nutrient intake sit an upper limit for nutrient intake sit an upper limit for nutrient intake upper safe limit for protein they said upper safe limit for protein they said upper safe limit for protein they said that's 35 percent that's 35 percent that's 35 percent we can't even get up

human body to replicate themselves so it's a good home for them themselves so it's a good home for them themselves so it's a good home for them but in any case it invades the human but in any case it invades the human but in any case it invades the human body now we're positive his virus is body now we're positive his virus is body now we're positive his virus is detected in our body now we're called a detected in our body now we're called a detected in our body now we're called a case we're called a positive effects case we're called a positive effects case we're called a positive effects okay it sits there you know virus system okay it sits there you know virus system okay it sits there you know virus system so far no problems no symptoms okay the so far no problems no symptoms okay the so far no problems no symptoms okay the virus in theory can travel one of two virus in theory can travel one of two virus in theory can travel one of two ways ways ways either it stays active hangs around it either it stays active hangs around it either it stays active hangs around it can cause this damage like in our case can cause this damage like in our case can cause this damage like in our case for the liver cancer for the liver cancer for the liver cancer that's what that's the symptoms of look that's what that's the symptoms of look that's what that's the symptoms of look that's death virus that's death virus that's death virus being expressed causing death being expressed causing death being expressed causing death that's one way the other way is maybe that's one way the other way is maybe that's one way the other way is maybe the body reacts to head don't like it the body reacts to head don't like it the body reacts to head don't like it and so it starts forming antibodies so and so it starts forming antibodies so and so it starts forming antibodies so it's there's this uh fork in the road it's there's this uh fork in the road it's there's this uh fork in the road here the virus is sitting there what's here the virus is sitting there what's here the virus is sitting there what's it going to do it's going to cause this it going to do it's going to cause this it going to do it's going to cause this problems or is our body going to fight problems or is our body going to fight problems or is our body going to fight back and form the antibodies pretty back and form the antibodies pretty back and form the antibodies pretty simple simple simple uh this as I say this is a data uh this as I say this is a data uh this as I say this is a data reflected in 1989 in China um it turns out that we had in that um it turns out that we had in that study as we had in the earlier we had a study as we had in the earlier we had a study as we had in the earlier we had a lot of lots of nutritional information lot of lots of nutritional information lot of lots of nutritional information to characterize these different steps in to characterize these different steps in to characterize these different steps in the pathway we had nutrition information the pathway we had nutrition information the pathway we had nutrition information to uh to show us you know what was to uh to show us you know what was to uh to show us you know what was associated with the formation antibodies associated with the formation antibodies associated with the formation antibodies what was associated with the production what was associated with the production what was associated with the production of you know taste test cases if you will of you know taste test cases if you will of you know taste test cases if you will as well as liver cancer as well as liver cancer as well as liver cancer that liver cancer thing as I say to that liver cancer thing as I say to that liver cancer thing as I say to emphasize once again it kills around 800 emphasize once again it kills around 800 emphasize once again it kills around 800 000 people a year worldwide it's been 000 people a year worldwide it's been 000 people a year worldwide it's been going on for decades it's a pretty going on for decades it's a pretty going on for decades it's a pretty serious cancer if I want to say let me serious cancer if I want to say let me serious cancer if I want to say let me tell you it comes from our China Study tell you it comes from our China Study tell you it comes from our China Study okay okay okay there's a reference is the publication there's a reference is the publication there's a reference is the publication so now I want to show you something so now I want to show you something so now I want to show you something about this B virus that I find really about this B virus that I find really about this B virus that I find really passionate 1989 8 000 peoples in the Sun passionate 1989 8 000 peoples in the Sun passionate 1989 8 000 peoples in the Sun once again I'm showing your scam ears once again I'm showing your scam ears once again I'm showing your

active virus now it's called an antigen active virus now it's called an antigen that's what folks around the body when that's what folks around the body when that's what folks around the body when we test positive as I said before we test positive as I said before we test positive as I said before in the case of of uh Hepatitis B virus in the case of of uh Hepatitis B virus in the case of of uh Hepatitis B virus if it's going to do its damage it's if it's going to do its damage it's if it's going to do its damage it's going to cause liver cancer deaths going to cause liver cancer deaths going to cause liver cancer deaths that's unfortunately cause a decimal that's unfortunately cause a decimal that's unfortunately cause a decimal world I should tell you that's what world I should tell you that's what world I should tell you that's what it's pretty common in Africa and Asia it's pretty common in Africa and Asia it's pretty common in Africa and Asia that that this kind of virus but in any that that this kind of virus but in any that that this kind of virus but in any case case case so we got the virus to come over here we so we got the virus to come over here we so we got the virus to come over here we had data and all this sort of thing it had data and all this sort of thing it had data and all this sort of thing it turns out that we learned from our turns out that we learned from our turns out that we learned from our information that animal food people information that animal food people information that animal food people consuming animal food and World tried consuming animal food and World tried consuming animal food and World tried and was a small amount and was a small amount and was a small amount on average only 10 percent more or less on average only 10 percent more or less on average only 10 percent more or less what we do in the west anyhow people what we do in the west anyhow people what we do in the west anyhow people consuming animal food they were the ones consuming animal food they were the ones consuming animal food they were the ones with the active virus they got infected with the active virus they got infected with the active virus they got infected the virus the virus called the cancer the virus the virus called the cancer the virus the virus called the cancer highly correlated with those two highly correlated with those two highly correlated with those two also at the same time we learned from also at the same time we learned from also at the same time we learned from laboratory studies that the people laboratory studies that the people laboratory studies that the people consuming a little more animal food consuming a little more animal food consuming a little more animal food uh they likely saw a decrease in their uh they likely saw a decrease in their uh they likely saw a decrease in their natural killer cells and I say likely natural killer cells and I say likely natural killer cells and I say likely because we we did a study in some because we we did a study in some because we we did a study in some companion experimental animal studies in companion experimental animal studies in companion experimental animal studies in the lab painting animals that actually the lab painting animals that actually the lab painting animals that actually right in this case mice did give rise to right in

But at the end of the presentation, I But at the end of the presentation, I But at the end of the presentation, I want to I'm going to end up with about want to I'm going to end up with about want to I'm going to end up with about eight principles and it's going to sort eight principles and it's going to sort eight principles and it's going to sort of like be the pillar post of how we of like be the pillar post of how we of like be the pillar post of how we tend to think about science and how that tend to think about science and how that tend to think about science and how that in turn tends to think and shape our way in turn tends to think and shape our way in turn tends to think and shape our way of thinking about nutrition and health. of thinking about nutrition and health. of thinking about nutrition and health. In any case, here's the second one. Uh In any case, here's the second one. Uh In any case, here's the second one. Uh this is a little schematic. This is this is a little schematic. This is this is a little schematic. This is schematic uh simply to illustrate let's schematic uh simply to illustrate let's schematic uh simply to illustrate let's say in this particular case how genes say in this particular case how genes say in this particular case how genes become involved in causing cancer become involved in causing cancer become involved in causing cancer information. what I'm showing here and information. what I'm showing here and information. what I'm showing here and this is just a schematic in this this is just a schematic in this this is just a schematic in this particular case here we've got some particular case here we've got some particular case here we've got some normal cells let's normal cells let's normal cells let's say on one hand if we let's say mutate say on one hand if we let's say mutate say on one hand if we let's say mutate some of these cells to create more some of these cells to create more some of these cells to create more cancer cancer cancer genes as you can see here with a red genes as you can see here with a red genes as you can see here with a red sort of little cells over here we'll sort of little cells over here we'll sort of little cells over here we'll take we'll do for comparison another take we'll do for comparison another take we'll do for comparison another sort of experiment where we create less sort of experiment where we create less sort of experiment where we create less cancer genes so we get two sort of cancer genes so we get two sort of cancer genes so we get two sort of situations here one situation with a lot situations here one situation with a lot situations here one situation with a lot of cancer genes the other with much of cancer genes the other with much of cancer genes the other with much less. Now from that point onwards in less. Now from that point onwards in less. Now from that point onwards in theory and to some extent in practice if theory and to some extent in practice if theory and to some extent in practice if the nutrition stays the the nutrition stays the the nutrition stays the same obviously the animals starting out same obviously the animals starting out same obviously the animals starting out or the or the or the people if if those of us who have more people if if those of us who have more people if if those of us who have more cancer genes and we do the same kind cancer genes and we do the same kind cancer genes and we do the same kind let's say in theory do the same kind of let's say in theory do the same kind of let's say in theory do the same kind of nutrition we get more tumors that is nutrition we get more tumors that is nutrition we get more tumors that is fair enough to say that genes cause fair enough to say that genes cause fair enough to say that genes cause cancer more cancer over here less over cancer more cancer over here less over cancer more cancer over here less over here so genes cause cancer here so genes cause cancer here so genes cause cancer That's a popular idea. We think genes That's a popular idea. We think genes That's a popular idea. We think genes cause cancer. I must tell you everything cause cancer. I must tell you everything cause cancer. I must tell you everything actually whether it's cancer or other actually whether it's cancer or other actually whether it's cancer or other diseases or good things, good health. diseases or good things, good health. diseases or good things, good health. Everything starts from a genetic basis. Everything starts from a genetic basis. Everything starts from a genetic basis. That's the first step. So we get all That's the first step. So we get all That's the first step. So we get all kinds of genes to do all kinds of kinds of genes to do all kinds of kinds of genes to do all kinds of things, good things, bad things if you things, good things, bad things if you things, good things, bad things if you will. So genes are the starting place will. So genes are the starting place will. So genes are the starting place and it's reasonable to assume therefore and it's reasonable to assume therefore and it's reasonable to assume therefore they are a cause. However, look at this. they are a cause. However, look at this. they are a cause. However, look at this. when in this particular kind of scheme when in this particular kind of scheme when in this particular kind of scheme and this is what we basically did. Uh in and this is what we basically did. Uh in and this is what we basically did. Uh in any case here in this particular case any case here in this particular case any case here in this particular case here these animals are destined to get here these animals are destined to get here these animals are destined to get more tumors these over here less but in more tumors these over here less but in more tumors these over here less but in fact if these in this particular case fact if these in this particular case fact if these in this particular case here are given low protein they get the here are given low protein they get the here are given low protein they get the less. So in other words whereas we may less. So in other words whereas we may less. So in other words whereas we may have assumed that genes are so important have assumed that genes are so important have assumed that genes are so important and how much you know altered genes we and how much you know altered genes we and how much you know altered genes we may have in the beginning what really may have in the beginning what really may have in the beginning what really matters is what we subsequently do with matters is what we subsequently do with matters is what we subsequently do with those genes. And so nutrition controls those genes. And so nutrition controls those genes. And so nutrition controls how genes behave. Very important how genes behave. Very important how genes behave. Very important principle. A very important principle principle. A very important principle principle. A very important principle has major implications for thinking has major implications for thinking has major implications for thinking about all kinds of things. So principle about all kinds of things. So principle about all kinds of things. So principle number two, nutrition cults genes which number two, nutrition cults genes which number two, nutrition cults genes which in turn control cancer. In cancer. In addition, then we I began to ask the addition, then we I began to ask the addition, then we I began to ask the question, I didn't pay a lot of question, I didn't pay a lot of question, I didn't pay a lot of attention to this in the beginning to attention to this in the beginning to attention to this in the beginning to start to ask the question, what about start to ask the question, what about start to ask the question, what about this protein that actually is this protein that actually is this protein that actually is controlling cancer growth? What is this controlling cancer growth? What is this controlling cancer growth? What is this protein we're using? Well, it turns out protein we're using? Well, it turns out protein we're using? Well, it turns out we were just simply using the protein we were just simply using the protein we were just simply using the protein that was available in the marketplace at that was available in the marketplace at that was available in the marketplace at the time that researchers tend to use, the time that researchers tend to use, the time that researchers tend to use, one readily available. It actually turns one readily available. It actually turns one readily available. It actually turns out to be cow's milk protein. out to be cow's milk protein. out to be cow's milk protein. So um that's basically casein So um that's basically casein So um that's basically casein representing 87% approximately of total representing 87% approximately of total representing 87% approximately of total protein in cow's milk. That's what was protein in cow's milk. That's what was protein in cow's milk. That's what was turning on in fact the cancer. So we turning on in fact the cancer. So we turning on in fact the cancer. So we said okay what happens if we try a said okay what happens if we try a said okay what happens if we try a couple of plant proteins in this model. couple of plant proteins in this model. couple of plant proteins in this model. It turned out when we tried soy protein It turned out when we tried soy protein It turned out when we tried soy protein and wheat protein even when fed at the and wheat protein even when fed at the and wheat protein even when fed at the high levels the 20% of total high levels the 20% of total high levels the 20% of total incidentally that 20% of protein in the incidentally that 20% of protein in the incidentally that 20% of protein in the diet was the amount more or less diet was the amount more or less diet was the amount more or less recommended. This is going to come back recommended. This is going to come back recommended. This is going to come back to be equivalent to what we do as humans to be equivalent to what we do as humans to be equivalent to what we do as humans too but for for just for the moment. But too but for for just for the moment. But too but for for just for the moment. But in any case soy protein we protein even in any case soy protein we protein even in any case soy protein we protein even when fed at the higher levels did not in when fed at the higher levels did not in when fed at the higher levels did not in fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was fact uh turn on that cancer. So here was all of a sudden an idea that was all of a sudden an idea that was all of a sudden an idea that was beginning to arise. Not enough beginning to arise. Not enough beginning to arise. Not enough information I can assure you, but it's information I can assure you, but it's information I can assure you, but it's certainly quite provocative in the in certainly quite provocative in the in certainly quite provocative in the in the different ways that these kinds of the different ways that these kinds of the different ways that these kinds of proteins proteins proteins behaved. So we had a principle here in behaved. So we had a principle here in behaved. So we had a principle here in my view, namely that nutrients of my view, namely that nutrients of my view, namely that nutrients of animal-based foods function differently animal-based foods function differently animal-based foods function differently from nutrients in plant-based foods. Now from nutrients in plant-based foods. Now from nutrients in plant-based foods. Now that's a big statement there to make that's a big statement there to make that's a big statement there to make with so little information. that with so little information. that with so little information. that information were provocative, yes, but information were provocative, yes, but information were provocative, yes, but in order to get really to that in order to get really to that in order to get really to that principle, we'd have to do a lot more. principle, we'd have to do a lot more. principle, we'd have to do a lot more. And we did do a lot more. We looked at And we did do a lot more. We looked at And we did do a lot more. We looked at things like pancreatic cancer, memory things like pancreatic cancer, memory things like pancreatic cancer, memory cancer, and different kinds of ways. We cancer, and different kinds of ways. We cancer, and different kinds of ways. We looked at other kinds of nutrients, not looked at other kinds of nutrients, not looked at other kinds of nutrients, not just protein. So, that statement there just protein. So, that statement there just protein. So, that statement there is based not on what I just showed you. is based not on what I just showed you. is based not on what I just showed you. It's actually based on comparing It's actually based on comparing It's actually based on comparing nutrients from plants and nutrients from nutrients from plants and nutrients from nutrients from plants and nutrients from animal foods and having a look to see animal foods and having a look to see animal foods and having a look to see what they did with respect to cancer what they did with respect to cancer what they did with respect to cancer which in turn leads us to that which in turn leads us to that which in turn leads us to that principle. principle. principle. Incidentally, one of the I one of the Incidentally, one of the I one of the Incidentally, one of the I one of the reasons I like to talk about reasons I like to talk about reasons I like to talk about principles that gets around that really principles that gets around that really principles that gets around that really gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning whether or not you're doing experiments whether or not you're doing experiments whether or not you're doing experiments in the in the in the laboratory with experimental animals, laboratory with experimental animals, laboratory with experimental animals, which I don't really support anymore, which I don't really support anymore, which I don't really support anymore, but that's the way we all did it. It but that's the way we all did it. It but that's the way we all did it. It gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning gets around the question concerning whether or not that information whether or not that information whether or not that information experimental animal situation is experimental animal situation is experimental animal situation is applicable to humans.

        "content": "•••   DAIRY MYTH   •••\nA long-standing, prevalent belief champions dairy as the perfect food. While it may indeed be ideal for calves it is not the case for humans. The perfect food for humans is human milk, and that too only during infancy. Humans are unique in two respects: (1) they continue milk consumption beyond infancy and (2) they consume the milk of another species. The origins of this practice are murky but it may have begun thousands of years ago during a famine. In desperate times consumption of cow’s milk, which led to survival, may have sparked the widespread domestication of cows.\nThis topic presents a personal conflict for me. Numerous doctors in the Plant-Based Whole Food (PBWF) movement advise against dairy, supported by a plethora of studies. However Ayurveda, an ancient Indian wisdom, endorses it, albeit sparingly. Most PBWF recommendations align with Ayurveda except for dairy products like milk and ghee.\nAll mammals nurse their young with milk specifically formulated for their offspring's growth rate. For instance, a calf grows tenfold in six months, necessitating a milk composition rich in proteins, fats, and growth hormones like IGF-1. These components, while beneficial for calves, can potentially fuel cancer cell growth in humans without affecting normal cells, akin to how fertilizers promote lawn growth but also enable weeds to flourish unchecked.\nINDIAN STUDY ON DAIRY PROTEIN\nA groundbreaking study in 1967 by Dr. Gopalan and Madhvan at the National Institute of Nutrition in Hyderabad (India) examined the effects of dietary protein levels on cancer development. Mice, injected with a carcinogen and fed diets of varying protein levels, showed a direct correlation between high dairy protein intake and cancer growth. This study, which initially perplexed many, including Dr. Colin Campbell, laid the groundwork for a significant shift in understanding the relationship between animal protein and cancer.\nDr. Campbell's subsequent research, including the comprehensive China Study, underscored the detrimental effects of animal proteins, particularly from dairy, on our health. These findings advocate for minimizing dairy and animal protein consumption in diets exceeding 8% total protein, especially in affluent societies with abundant food choices.\nIt's important to recognize that dairy products do not cause cancer - they only contribute to its progression. The initiation of cancer is primarily due to gene mutations, which can result from a variety of factors such as radiation and toxic chemicals present in our environment. This suggests that cancer-causing agents were less prevalent in ancient times.\nIn scenarios of food scarcity, dairy protein can be considered a viable nutritional option. Historically milk likely played a crucial role during times of famine, potentially saving many communities from extinction. It is also worth noting that gene mutations caused by toxic chemicals and radiation were presumably less common in the past due to the limited presence of these harmful agents.\nIn 1967, the per capita milk consumption in India was 107 ml per person- today it has quadrupled to 427 ml per person. This increase occurred despite widespread knowledge of milk's potential role in promoting health issues, including cancer. While the Government of India recognized Dr. Gopalan's contributions with the Padma Bhushan award, his advice on this matter was not heeded.\nWhy Milk Today is Harmful Compared to The Past\nToday's dairy products differ significantly from those our ancestors consumed and we face different health challenges. Factors contributing to the harm caused by modern dairy include industrial farming practices, the genetic composition of dairy cows and the increased presence of environmental carcinogens. Additionally, lifestyle changes and increased life expectancy call for a reevaluation of dairy's role in our diet. Here are some examples:\n* Dairy cows are kept pregnant through artificial insemination.\n* They are fed pesticide ridden food which is unfit for human consumption.\n* They are injected with growth hormones to increase milk yield.\n* They are injected with high-dose antibiotics to keep them infection free in otherwise poor unhygienic conditions.\nAll these toxic chemicals do show up in the milk cows produce and are very harmful to human health.\nLife expectancy in the olden days was low and an age of 70-80 was considered a life long lived. Very few lived beyond that. Today we are talking about increasing human life expectancy to 100+ years like in Blue Zones.\nI have discussed this subject face to face with Dr. Colin Campbell, Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn, Dr. John Mcdugall and Dr. Michael Gregor. They all are against consuming dairy products. Dr. Collin Campbell did concede that if the total protein in a diet is less than 8% then milk may be okay to consume as long as it is procured from grass fed, free range cows.\nWhy Dairy Is Unhealthy?\nNumerous studies and expert opinions highlight dairy's potential health risks including its ineffectiveness in bone health, its link to cancer, and its contribution to various diseases and conditions. Widespread lactose intolerance further underscores dairy's unsuitability for many. Here are some specific examples:\n(1) There is no evidence that milk reduces bone fracture. In fact, there is evidence that suggests otherwise. Countries in Africa which have the lowest rate of milk consumption also have the lowest rate of osteoporosis. Conversely, countries consuming the most milk have the  highest rate of hip fractures. A 2003 Harvard nurses study of 70,000 women for 18 years demonstrated that there was no protective effect on bone health among dairy consumers.\n(2) Dairy consumption increases the body’s level of IGF-1 hormone and estrogens which are known cancer promoters and implicated with prostate and breast cancer risks.\n(3) According to a 2006 study by Harvard researchers, conducted with 10,000 women aged 26-46, the women who consumed the most dairy products were at higher risk of breast cancer. Another 2014 study has shown that milk and dairy product consumption increases the risk of breast, lung and ovarian cancer.\n(4) Additional growth hormones (synthetic Bovine hormones) injected in cows to increase milk production interfere with normal hormone functions in human body.\n(5) Milk is one of the largest sources of dioxins which can affect the central nervous, immune and reproductive systems of the human body.\n(6) Milk and cheese can cause acne.\n(7) Dairy is full of saturated fat which is implicated in cardio vascular diseases.\n(8) Dairy aggravates Irritable Bowl Syndrome.\n(9) Dairy is a cause of autoimmune diseases like arthritis.\n(10) Three fourth of the world population is lactose intolerant and genetically unable to properly digest milk. In most children after the age of five, the enzymes that help digest lactose decline, making them lactose intolerant.\n(11) Dairy consumption in childhood is a leading cause of Type-1 diabetes.\n(12) Dairy is also implicated in chronic constipation.\n(13) Other problems associated with dairy include allergies and sinus issues.\n(14) Milk can also increase men’s risk of having Parkinson’s disease. The main reason for this is that cows milk is contaminated with pesticides which cows consume with their grain fed diet.\nCalcium Myth\nContrary to popular belief, the calcium in dairy is not efficiently absorbed due to its unfavorable phosphorus to calcium ratio. In order to absorb calcium one needs a calcium product that is conducive to absorption. The presence of phosphorus binds calcium to make calcium phosphate and biphosphate and diphosphate and makes it unavailable for absorption. To absorb calcium it must be available without phosphorus and milk does not provide that. So, for the most part, the calcium in the milk is in nonabsorbable. This is the reason why milk does not help people with osteoporosis. It even hurts them.\nGiving calcium pills as supplement also doesn’t help people with osteoporosis. Calcium just goes through the body and is excreted. Even vitamin D supplementation does not help.\nOne has to do something to the bones to get calcium inside the bones. All the trials of supplementing calcium with vitamin D have failed.\nDr. Lustig of UCSF recommends giving calcium to phosphorus in ratio of 4:1 whereas in milk it is 1:2.\nTo achieve satisfactory calcium absorption other forms of calcium are required like calcium chloride or citrate.\nHere are some additional comments that support PBWF doctors' view against dairy.\n* Many of my health group members have reported curing asthma, nasal congestion, seasonal allergies, digestive problems, constipation, and even headaches after giving up dairy.\n* Dr. Neil Bernard filed a lawsuit against US government’s campaign “Milk Does the Body Good” and won. The advertisements had to be stopped by court order.\n* The US government has been recommending 3 glasses of milk a day in its dietary guidelines but these guidelines are politically biased and not based on science. Head of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health was one of the most vocal critic of these guidelines and had called them “utterly ridiculous”.\n* If one must consume some dairy, the least harmful products are ghee (butter oil), buttermilk, yogurt and kefir. One must find organic sources which are growth hormone (RBST) free. This hormone is banned in Europe, Canada, Japan, Argentina and Australia.\nConclusion\nDespite its historical role in human nutrition, the evidence against dairy consumption's health benefits is compelling. Alternatives to dairy, including plant-based milks and yogurts, offer nutritious and safe options for those seeking to avoid dairy's pitfalls. Acknowledging both the scientific findings and the cultural practices surrounding dairy consumption can guide us towards healthier dietary choices.

        "content": "(upbeat music) - Hey munchies, I'm Alyssia if you're new. Welcome! I use milk in a lot of recipes, but it's almost never dairy milk. Actually, I can't even remember the last time I used dairy milk. But you can sub out most any kind of non-dairy milk for most recipes, depending on what you've got for the flavor. Today I'm showing you how to make your own non-dairy milk seven ways, and I've got a free e-book for you to top it off, with three additional ways. Stay tuned. We'll get started with the most basic: a nut milk. I'm making cashew milk because it's my personal favorite, but you can use any nut that your prefer. Almond for a classic almond milk, or even hazelnut, pecan, or walnut. For most of these recipes, the procedure is similar. Start with your raw ingredient, add water, and soak overnight. Drain the water and add the nuts to a blender, along with some additional filtered water. I love my food processor, but I do find that a blender is easier and less messy to work with for homemade milks. Let that go for a good few minutes until it's milky and smooth. Then we're gonna use a handy dandy nut milk bag to strain the mixture. You can get these on Amazon pretty cheap. I'll link some in the description, but there are tons of types, and you can also use a kitchen towel or a few layers of cheese cloth if you don't have or don't wanna get a nut milk bag. I'm making a bunch of milks today, so I invested. (chill electronic music) Use your hands to get as much liquid out as possible, really squeeze it out, and what will be left in the bag is your pulp, cashew pulp in this case, which you can totally save for adding to smoothies, or you can dry it out and use it as a nut flour for baking. No need to waste, which is pretty cool. Transfer the milk to an airtight container and refrigerate. It will last three to four days in the fridge. These milks will separate after some time since there's no carrageenan, and they're all natural, but just give them A quick shake to reintegrate and you're good to go. Cashew milk tastes similar to almond milk, but is perhaps a little less nutty and creamier. Okay, so that is the oh so basic nut milk. Shall we get on to the rest? And guess what: none of them are nuts. That's nuts! Let's do coconut milk next, which really only needs plain, unsweetened coconut shreds. I wanted to show you guys that you can also add in fun flavors to your non-dairy milks, so I'm going to make this on a strawberry coconut milk, but you could leave it plain or swap out and of these flavor ideas I'm showing with any of the milks, and the instructions for how to do that specifically are in that free e-book you're gonna get. Don't worry about taking notes. Soak the shreds in water for a few hours. It doesn't need to be overnight. Add that mixture to a blender with strawberries and blend for a good few minutes. So in case you're confused, in your wanted plain coconut milk, you would just not include the strawberries. Nothing else needs to change. Strain that mixture through your nut milk bag or tool of choice and voila! A naturally sweet and decadent coconut milk. Now, strawberry coconut milk is mostly good for drinking, or you could use it for smoothies, oatmeal, overnight oats, et cetera, but plain coconut milk is also great for curries, soups, and cooking. Homemade coconut milk is not great for frozen treats because it doesn't have enough fat solids. Okay, next up is rice milk: cinnamon flavor. You can make rice milk with cooked or uncooked rice, and you can use white or brown. I actually like the flavor of uncooked and prefer white, so I am soaking uncooked long-grain white rice in water overnight. Drain it, add additional water to a blender with some cinnamon for flavor, maybe even a pinch of salt, and let it rip. Continue on accordingly. (bright music) Rice milk actually has a pretty mild taste. It's light and a little bit sweet naturally, which pairs really nicely with that cinnamon. This is almost like something I've had before. Horchata, anyone? (bright music) Thumbs up if you are enjoying these non-dairy milk recipes, please! Matcha oat milk. Oat milk is one of my favorite types of milks, and it's becoming more and more popular. The main ingredient: oats, of course! I prefer to not soak oats and just add water at the time of, but some people do like to soak them. I also use rolled oats, but some people make this with steel-cut oats. Then you can just add high quality matcha powder. It should be bright green, not dull, or else it will taste bitter, and then blend and strain. (upbeat electronic music) As plain oat milk, this does have sort of a strong oat flavor, which I like, but it will depend how you wanna use it if your should consider using oat milk as an option. Either way, oat milk is full-bodied, flavorful, and so versatile. Blueberry hemp milk. This one doesn't require soaking, which is nice. It's made from hemp seeds, which means you're getting antiinflammatory effects of the omega-3s, as well as protein. Blend together raw hemp seeds, water, and blueberries, if you want the flavor, until milky. (upbeat music) Strain and serve. Hemp milk has a nutty flavor. For all of these milks, so you know, the amount of water can totally be adjusted if you want a thicker or a more prominent texture, or a thinner and less noticeable texture. Hemp milk is one of the more naturally thin non-dairy milks, so it isn't ideal for adding to your coffee. It's better for just drinking or cereal, oatmeal, et cetera, especially with those blueberries. Vanilla soy milk. When it comes to making soy milk, the most important factor is your beans. Use good quality, mature soy beans, which are going to be white. I got these on Amazon, and we'll link them. Soak the beans overnight with water. Notice how much the absorb the water and really plump up in size. Drain and then add additional filtered water and blend until milky. Soy milk is the one milk that you need to heat to help the flavor. (bright music) Add the mixture to a saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to low and cook for 15-20 minutes, stirring regularly. The longer you cook, the less bitter and sweeter it will become. Skim the foam topping, allow it to cool, and then you can remove the skin that forms on top. (bright music) Add the cooled mixture with vanilla extract to your nut milk bag, strain, and enjoy. If you wanted a fruit flavored soy milk, like berry flavored, you'd wanna blend the berries with the cooled, strained soy milk, and then strain once more. Voila! I am not gonna lie, I have a soy milk weakness. It's so tasty, even unsweetened and plain, because it has a natural sweetness that is so satisfying. Don't forget to subscribe and hit the bell for more recipe videos, educational content, and free e-books. The last one I'm sharing today here is a sweet sesame milk. (chill music) Soak raw sesame seeds for a few hours and then blend with water and dates. You know the drill. (chill music) Dates are a great way to add natural sweetness to any of these milks when you make them plain too, but paired with the sesame flavor, oh man. Something about sesame and dates just reminds me of caramel. I love it. (chill music) Okay, so there were seven different non-dairy milks, but I also have three more: a mango quinoa milk, a chocolate chia milk, and a golden banana milk in that free e-book that you can get by clicking the link in my description. FYI, you can also do blends of these milks, like a macadamia hemp or a coconut cashew, for instance, and I've included a few recipes with those types of mix and match ideas in the e-book as well, but I do encourage you to get creative and make your own combos too. You saw how easy it was, and it's so nice to know that I can make all of these at home without any added ingredients that just aren't necessary, and they'll be more affordable than buying the cleaner options at the store. I hope you enjoyed these recipes. Let me know your favorite non-dairy milk in the comments below. If you found this episode fun, or helpful, or learned something, would you share it with someone you know? I appreciate you, and I will see you next week right here. Remember, it's all a matter of mind over munch.",

carbo loading I'm eating lots and lots of bread and pasta does it go to fat of bread and pasta does it go to fat of bread and pasta does it go to fat no the reason athletes eat it so much of no the reason athletes eat it so much of no the reason athletes eat it so much of it is because it goes into their muscles it is because it goes into their muscles it is because it goes into their muscles

now the glycogen is stored there too now theoretically you can build fat from theoretically you can build fat from theoretically you can build fat from carbohydrate but even if you ate the carbohydrate but even if you ate the carbohydrate but even if you ate the entire loaf of bread and it was more entire loaf of bread and it was more entire loaf of bread and it was more than you needed and your your glycogen than you needed and your your glycogen than you needed and your your glycogen stores were all filled if you made fat stores were all filled if you made fat stores were all filled if you made fat from it even that to make bread into fat from it even that to make bread into fat from it even that to make bread into fat is hard for your body is hard for your body is hard for your body and it uses up about 25% or so of its and it uses up about 25% or so of its and it uses up about 25% or so of its calories just to try to make it now on calories just to try to make it

it to Fat because it's already fat it to Fat because it's already fat it doesn't really require much of any doesn't really require much of any doesn't really require much of any conversion you eat it it goes into your conversion you eat it it goes into your conversion you eat it it goes into your blood stores it's fat very simple okay blood stores it's fat very simple okay blood stores it's fat very simple okay number three fat slows your metabolism number three fat slows your metabolism number three fat slows your metabolism here's what I mean this is a muscle cell here's what I mean this is a muscle cell here's what I mean this is a muscle cell and the reason I'm showing you a muscle and the reason I'm showing you a muscle and the reason I'm showing you a muscle cell is you hear people say don't lose cell is you hear people say don't lose cell is you hear people say don't lose your muscle mass your your muscle are your muscle mass your your muscle are your muscle mass your your muscle are your calorie burners you know what I'm your calorie burners you know what I'm your calorie burners you know what I'm talking about okay so inside your talking about okay so inside your talking about okay so inside your muscles are mitochondria you remember muscles are mitochondria you remember muscles are mitochondria you remember the mitochondria from high school the mitochondria from high school the mitochondria from high school biology those are your calorie burners biology those are your calorie burners biology those are your calorie burners you have a lot of them but you also have you have a lot of them but you also have you have a lot of them but you also have little bits of fat now doctors hate little bits of fat now doctors hate little bits of fat now doctors hate words like fat because it only has one words like fat because it only has one words like fat because it only has one syllable so we'll call it syllable so we'll call it syllable so we'll call it intramyocellular lipid but it's it's fat intramyocellular lipid but it's it's fat intramyocellular lipid but it's it's fat inside your cell and if you ate a little inside your cell and if you ate a little inside your cell and if you ate a little bit too much chicken fat or beef fat or bit too much chicken fat or beef fat or bit too much chicken fat or beef fat or Vita or friy or Grease for that matter Vita or friy or Grease for that matter Vita or friy or Grease for that matter the fat builds up inside your the fat builds up inside your the fat builds up inside your cell when that happens the cell cell when that happens the cell cell when that happens the cell says says says fantastic this is great I've got some fantastic this is great I've got some fantastic this is great I've got some fat that I can store up and if we happen fat that I can store up and if we happen fat that I can store up and if we happen to have a famine some time I'm sitting to have a famine some time I'm sitting to have a famine some time I'm sitting pretty I got a lot of stored calories pretty I got a lot of stored calories pretty I got a lot of stored calories now if the mitochondria burn it all up now if the mitochondria burn it all up now if the mitochondria burn it all up it's gone so when fat comes into the it's gone so when fat comes into the it's gone so when fat comes into the cell the body turns down the production cell the body turns down the production cell the body turns down the production of mitochondri Andria to keep the fat of mitochondri Andria to keep the fat of mitochondri Andria to keep the fat and your metabolism slows down to and your metabolism slows down to and your metabolism slows down to preserve this fat richness that just preserve this fat richness that just preserve this fat richness that just came in and that's the opposite of what came in and that's the opposite of what came in and that's the opposite of what you want you say wait a minute I just you want you say wait a minute I just you want you say wait a minute I just ate too much why are you storing it you ate too much why are you storing it you ate too much why are you storing it you got to get rid of it the body was got to get rid of it the body was got to get rid of it the body was programmed a long time ago when there programmed a long time ago when there programmed a long time ago when there were such things as famines so if you were such things as famines so if you were such things as famines so if you ate a big fatty thing your body says ate a big fatty thing your body says ate a big fatty thing your body says I'll keep that and as the years go by I'll keep that and as the years go by I'll keep that and as the years go by people's the the metabolism you had when people's the the metabolism you had when people's the the metabolism you had when you were 12 is just no longer there you were 12 is just no longer there you were 12 is just no longer there because the mitochondria have been because the mitochondria have been because the mitochondria have been Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan diet time goes in the opposite direction diet time goes in the opposite direction diet time goes in the opposite direction okay number four cheese does not have okay number four cheese

okay so why is cheese fattening survey okay so why is cheese fattening survey okay so why is cheese fattening it's high in calories the fat adds to it's high in calories the fat adds to it's high in calories the fat adds to your body fat it slows down your your body fat it slows down your your body fat it slows down your metabolism day by day it doesn't have metabolism day by day it doesn't have

and Bloated okay now you've heard about the Adventist Health study heard about the Adventist Health study heard about the Adventist Health study researchers have studied Seventh Day researchers have studied Seventh Day researchers have studied Seventh Day Adventist for years because Church Adventist for years because Church Adventist for years because Church teachings say don't smoke don't drink teachings say don't smoke don't drink teachings say don't smoke don't drink avoid caffeine don't eat meat avoid caffeine don't eat meat avoid caffeine don't eat meat and almost all Adventists are very good and almost all Adventists are very good and almost all Adventists are very good at the first at the first at the first three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking healthc conscious people but some eat healthc conscious people but some eat healthc conscious people but some eat meat and some do not and that sets up a meat and some do not and that sets up a meat and some do not and that sets up a perfect natural experiment that perfect natural experiment that perfect natural experiment that researchers can take advantage of so the researchers can take advantage of so the researchers can take advantage of so the Adventist Health study too brought in Adventist Health study too brought in Adventist Health study too brought in not quite 61,000 people and they were not quite 61,000 people and they were not quite 61,000 people and they were all over 30 and they split them into all over 30 and they split them into all over 30 and they split them into five groups based on the diets that they five groups based on the diets that they five groups based on the diets that they normally followed normally followed normally followed and they looked at everyone's body mass and they looked at everyone's body mass and they looked at everyone's body mass IND are body mass index are you familiar IND are body mass index are you familiar IND are body mass index are you familiar with that with that with that BMI it's it's just your weight based on BMI it's it's just your weight based on BMI it's it's just your weight based on but adjusted for how tall you are and so but adjusted for how tall you are and so but adjusted for how tall you are and so a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on the left the Red Band there those are the left the Red Band there those are the left the Red Band there those are nonvegetarians or or basically meat nonvegetarians or or basically meat nonvegetarians or or basically meat eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it was was was 28.8 and the next group were people 28.8 and the next group were people 28.8 and the next group were people called semian Arians meaning they ate called semian Arians meaning they ate called semian Arians meaning they ate meat but only once a week or meat but only once a week or meat but only once a week or less little bit Slimmer the third group less little bit Slimmer the third group less little bit Slimmer the third group The Pesco vegetarians Pesco The Pesco vegetarians Pesco The Pesco vegetarians Pesco meaning okay all right fish they're not meaning okay all right fish they're not meaning okay all right fish they're not eating any meat except for fish they're eating any meat except for fish they're eating any meat except for fish they're a little

tell my patients that a vegan is not to tell my patients that a vegan is not a person from the planet Vegas um but a person from the planet Vegas um but a person from the planet Vegas um but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they're actually the only group smack in they're actually the only group smack in they're actually the only group smack in the middle of the healthy weight range the middle of the healthy weight range the middle of the healthy weight range and so now let's compare the lacto oo and so now let's compare the lacto oo and so now let's compare the lacto oo vegetarians and the vegetarians and the vegetarians and the vegans um I am going to argue that vegans um I am going to argue that vegans um I am going to argue that cheese is one of the biggest cheese is one of the biggest cheese is one of the biggest contributors to the extra weight that we contributors to the extra weight that we contributors to the extra weight that we see with the lacto OS and that see with the lacto OS and that see with the lacto OS and that difference is roughly 15 difference is roughly 15 difference is roughly 15 pounds make sense okay so what the heck pounds make sense okay so what the heck pounds make sense okay so what the heck is cheese well you start with milk this is cheese well you start with

in in Teresa Wisconsin the milk comes in in Teresa Wisconsin the milk comes in in the morning and they pour it in this big the morning and they pour it in this big the morning and they pour it in this big tub and then they add some tub and then they add some tub and then they add some bacteria and that gives it that kind of bacteria and that gives it that kind of bacteria and that gives it that kind of funky smell um because it's fermenting funky smell um because it's fermenting funky smell um because it's fermenting the sugars that are in the milk the the sugars that are in the milk the the

pregnant mammals they they're they're pregnant mammals they they're they're pregnant they give birth and they and the milk they give birth and they and the milk they give birth and they and the milk comes out okay so as the pregnancy comes out okay so as the pregnancy comes out okay so as the pregnancy proceeds hormones are produced in the proceeds hormones are produced in the proceeds hormones are produced in the the body of the cow and you can measure the body of the cow and you can measure the body of the cow and you can measure them in the blood plasma they it goes up them in the blood plasma they it goes up them in the blood plasma they it goes up and these hormones end up in the milk and these hormones end up in the milk and these hormones end up in the milk there they go and most of the milk that there they go and most of the milk that there they go and most of the milk that anybody ever drinks or that is on the anybody ever drinks or that is on the anybody ever drinks or that is on the shelves of any grocery store in America shelves of any grocery store in America shelves of any grocery store in America most of it comes from pregnant most of it comes from pregnant most of

don't know this affect a woman well I don't know this affect a woman well I don't know but researchers have looked into this but researchers have looked into this but researchers have looked into this and what they found is interesting uh and what they found is interesting uh and what they found is interesting uh some Australian researchers in 2010 some Australian researchers in 2010 some Australian researchers in 2010 brought in a group of women who were brought in a group of women who were brought in a group of women who were postmenopausal postmenopausal postmenopausal meaning shouldn't be having a lot of meaning shouldn't be having a lot of meaning shouldn't be having a lot of estrogen in your blood no matter what estrogen in your blood no matter what estrogen in your blood no matter what and they put them into four groups and they put them into four groups and they put them into four groups depending on how much Dairy they ate and depending on how much Dairy they ate and depending on how much Dairy they ate and the group on the left was the people who the group on the left was the people who the group on the left was the people who were the dairy were the dairy were the dairy avoiders and the other three bars are avoiders and the other three bars are avoiders and the other three bars are the people who have had had Dairy as a the people who have had had Dairy as a the people who have had had Dairy as a regular part of their life and what regular part of their life and what regular part of their life and what seems to really make the difference is seems to really make the difference is seems to really make the difference is do you have it or do you not have it do you have it or do you not have it do you have it or do you not have it once people are having a substantial once people are having a substantial once people are having a substantial amount they tend to have a lot of estrad amount they tend to have a lot of estrad amount they tend to have a lot of estrad in their in their in their blood men don't go to sleep researchers blood men don't go to sleep researchers blood men don't go to sleep researchers at Rochester New York went into a at Rochester New York went into a at Rochester New York went into a fertility clinic and they interviewed fertility clinic and they interviewed fertility clinic and they interviewed men and said are you a low cheese eater men and said are you a low cheese eater men and said are you a low cheese eater half a serving a day no more than that half a serving a day no more than that half a serving a day no more than that or are you a big cheese eater like a or are you a big cheese eater like a or are you a big cheese eater like a serving two and a half servings a day serving two and a half servings a day serving two and a half servings a day and they looked at their sperm counts and they looked at their sperm counts and they looked at their sperm counts and the people who tended to avoid and the people who tended to avoid and the people who tended to avoid cheese had better sperm counts the cheese had better sperm counts the cheese had better sperm counts the people who were Big Cheese folks had people who were Big Cheese folks had people who were Big Cheese folks had pretty low sperm counts now is that pretty low sperm counts now is that pretty low sperm counts now is that because there are female hormones from because there are female hormones from because there are female hormones from the milk because the cows are pregnant the milk because the cows are pregnant the

um this is Chad let's talk about asthma um this is Chad let's talk about asthma um this is Chad from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived right on the water with his brother and right on the water with his brother and right on the water with his brother and his family and Chad was a very active his family and Chad was a very active his family and Chad was a very active kid he loved sports but he could not get kid he loved sports but he could not get kid he loved sports but he could not get through a baseball game because asthma through a baseball game because asthma through a baseball game because asthma would kick in after the exercise or all would kick in after the exercise or all would kick in after the exercise or all the pollen that he was uh breathing in the pollen that he was uh breathing in the pollen that he was uh breathing in and he had every kind of allergy he was and he had every kind of

somebody when he was about 18 said hey could it be dairy hey could it be dairy hey could it be dairy products why don't you why don't you get products why don't you why don't you get products why don't you why don't you get away from dairy and just away from dairy and just away from dairy and just see and he did he tried it and within see and he did he tried it and within see and he did he tried it and within about 3 months not only was his asthma about 3 months not only was his asthma about 3 months not only was his asthma completely gone but so were his completely gone but so were his completely gone but so were his allergies and what's this about somehow allergies and what's this about somehow allergies and what's this about somehow get avoiding these antigens from dairy get avoiding these antigens from dairy get avoiding these antigens from dairy made his body react in a different way made his body react in a different way made his body react in a different way so scientists have looked into this so scientists have looked into this so scientists have looked into this question could dairy products actually question could dairy products actually question could dairy products actually contribute to asthma and if you go on contribute to asthma and if you go on contribute to asthma and if you go on Google and you type in Google and you type in Google and you

in 1991 had 11 New York University in 1991 had 11 New York University in 1991 had 11 adults they all had asthma and they adults they all had asthma and they adults they all had asthma and they drank either whole milk skim milk or drank either whole milk skim milk or drank either whole milk skim milk or water and what they showed is if they water and what they showed is if they water and what they showed is if they drank whole milk their ability to have drank whole milk their ability to have drank whole milk their ability to have uh gases passed through their lungs got uh gases passed through their lungs got uh gases passed through their lungs got progressively worse from the milk and progressively worse from the milk and progressively worse from the milk and they thought it had to do perhaps with they thought it had to do perhaps with they thought it had to do perhaps with the fatty the fatty the fatty milk so cheese would even be worse then milk so cheese would even be worse then milk so cheese would even be worse then there was a UK study from the United there was a UK study from the United there was a UK study from the United Kingdom it kids they were between three Kingdom it kids they were between three Kingdom it kids they were between three and 14 years of age and they gave them a and 14 years of age and they gave them a and 14 years of age and they gave them a milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and and the way you test this if if you know and the way you test this if if you know and the way you test this if if you know anybody who has asthma if you have it anybody who has asthma if you have it anybody who has asthma if you have it yourself you try to see if the kid can yourself you try to see if the kid can yourself you try to see if the kid can breathe out if they can have good breathe out if they can have good breathe out if they can have good expiratory flow because that's what expiratory flow because that's what expiratory flow because that's what tends to go bad and what they showed is tends to go bad and what they showed is tends to go bad and what they showed is that if they went egg and dairy free that if they went egg and dairy free that if they went egg and dairy free their ability to breathe out was much their ability to breathe out was much their ability to breathe out was much much much better it really helped them much much better it really helped them much much better it really helped them clear up now this was a study that went clear up now this was a study that went clear up now this was a study that went over eight weeks and it just so happened over eight weeks and it just so happened over eight weeks and it just so happened that Easter was in the middle of that that Easter was in the middle of that that Easter was in the middle of that period so they went to the Chocolate period so they went to the Chocolate period so they went to the Chocolate Factory and said okay do you have Factory and said okay do you have Factory and said okay do you have non-dairy bunnies for us which they did non-dairy bunnies for us which they did non-dairy bunnies for us which they did and these kids got a lot better bottom and these kids got a lot better bottom and these kids got a lot better bottom line is couldn't find evidence that set line is couldn't find evidence that set line is couldn't find evidence that set this aside people haven't really looked this aside people haven't really looked this aside people haven't really looked at it very much at all because no one's at it very much at all because no one's at it very much at all because no one's making money if you stop consuming milk making money if you stop consuming milk making money if you stop consuming milk but all the evidence I have seen and but all the evidence I have seen and but all the evidence I have seen and lots and lots of individual cases have lots and

what they sausage fermented foods and what they sausage fermented foods and what they are telling you as every website on are telling you as every website on are telling you as every website on asthma will say is that these foods have asthma will say is that these foods have asthma will say is that these foods have tyrosine which converts to tyramine and tyrosine which converts to tyramine and tyrosine which converts to tyramine and that tightens up your brain that tightens up your brain that tightens up your brain true however we have seen a lot of true however we have seen a lot of true however we have seen a lot of people have migraines that are triggered people have migraines that are triggered people have migraines that are triggered by other things too and it doesn't by other

children in London the hospital for sick children in London the hospital for sick children in London back in back in back in 1983 they started exploring this they 1983 they started exploring this they 1983 they started exploring this they brought in a group of kids 88 kids and brought in a group of kids 88 kids and brought in a group of kids 88 kids and they put them on an Elimination Diet not they put them on an Elimination Diet not they put them on an Elimination Diet not just eliminating Dairy but other common just eliminating Dairy but other common just eliminating Dairy but other common allergens and 78 of the kids were allergens and 78 of the kids were allergens and 78 of the kids were completely headache completely headache completely headache free and four had a partial Improvement free and four had a partial Improvement free and four had a partial Improvement so this is good now in adults I don't so this is good now in adults I don't so this is good now in adults I don't see quite that degree of success but we see quite that degree of success but we see quite that degree of success but we do see it uh up to about 50% and there do see it uh up to about 50% and there do see it uh up to about 50% and there are a number number of triggers other are a number number of triggers other are a number number of triggers other than Dairy that that sometimes can be than Dairy that that sometimes can be than Dairy that that sometimes can be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be the most commonly reported one and if the most commonly reported one and if the most commonly reported one and if you're dealing with migraines and can't you're dealing with migraines and can't you're

are one of the ones that Dairy proteins are one of the ones that Dairy proteins are one of the ones that people are sensitive to so researchers people are sensitive to so researchers people are sensitive to so researchers have looked into this and starting with have looked into this and starting with have looked into this and starting with an individual case report back in 1985 an individual case report back in 1985 an individual case report back in 1985 as one girl she had terrible juvenile as one girl she had terrible juvenile as one girl she had terrible juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor said thoughtful doctor said get away said thoughtful doctor said get away said thoughtful doctor said get away from dairy this could be it symptoms from dairy this could be it symptoms from dairy this could be it symptoms completely remitted and then she went completely remitted and then she went completely remitted and then she went and visited Grandma who would give her and visited Grandma who would give her and visited Grandma who would give her milk chocolate candy and her symptoms milk chocolate candy and her symptoms milk chocolate candy and her symptoms came back and she got off it and the came back and she got off it and the came back and she got off it and the symptoms went away and then a symptoms went away and then a symptoms went away and then a pediatrician said this can't be true you pediatrician said this can't be true you pediatrician said this can't be true you should have milk for calcium her should have milk for calcium her should have milk for calcium her symptoms came back and they went back symptoms came back and they went back symptoms came back and they went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and the pattern became and forth and the pattern became and forth and the pattern became inescapable so they published the uh inescapable so they published the uh inescapable so they published the uh findings in the Journal of the Royal findings in the Journal of the Royal findings in the Journal of the Royal Society of medicine saying here's one Society of medicine saying here's one Society of medicine saying here's one case maybe other people have Diet uh case maybe other people have Diet uh case maybe other people have Diet uh induced arthritis and so triggers have induced arthritis and so triggers have induced arthritis and so triggers have been identified not in everybody but been identified not in everybody but been identified not in everybody but somewhere between 20 and 60% of people somewhere between 20 and 60% of people somewhere between 20 and 60% of people in research studies and in a SL Norway in research studies and in a SL Norway in research studies and in a SL Norway researchers brought in a group of people researchers brought in a group of people researchers brought in a group of people and started them on a juice fast and and started them on a juice fast and and started them on a juice fast and then a vegan diet and then a lacto then a vegan diet and then a lacto then a vegan diet and then a lacto vegetarian diet but within the very vegetarian diet but within the very vegetarian diet but within the very first month they found clear-cut first month they found clear-cut first month they found clear-cut symptomatic Improvement and reduction in symptomatic Improvement and reduction in symptomatic Improvement and reduction in in biomarkers as well uh less pain less in biomarkers as well uh less pain less in biomarkers as well uh less pain less tenderness less swelling and then John tenderness less swelling and then John tenderness less swelling and then John McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan just a vegan low-fat diet and found that just a vegan low-fat diet and found that just a vegan low-fat diet and found that within a four-week time frame you saw uh within a four-week time frame you saw uh within a four-week time frame you saw uh improvements particularly in people who improvements particularly in people who improvements particularly in people who are relatively new to having rheumatoid are relatively new to having rheumatoid are relatively new to having rheumatoid arthritis arthritis arthritis okay prostate cancer is one of the most okay prostate cancer is one of the most okay prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer that we have common forms of cancer that we have common forms of cancer that we have obviously and for many many years obviously and for many many years obviously and for many many years researchers have said this is something researchers have said this is something researchers have said this is something that it goes with milk that the that it goes with milk that the that it goes with milk that the countries that have the highest milk countries that have the highest milk countries that have the highest milk consumption that's on the on the right consumption that's on the on the right consumption that's on the on the right hand side they've got the most prostate hand side they've got the most prostate hand side they've got the most prostate cancer well at Harvard the physicians's cancer well at Harvard the physicians's cancer well at Harvard the physicians's health study said in our group of 21,000 health study said in our group of 21,000 health study said in our group of 21,000 Physicians it's true two and a half Physicians it's true two and a half Physicians it's true two and a half servings of dairy products a day every servings of dairy products a day every servings of dairy products a day every day increases your risk of prostate day increases your risk of prostate day increases your risk of prostate cancer about 34% they did another study cancer about 34% they did another study cancer about 34% they did another study called the health professionals called the health professionals called the health professionals follow-up study same thing the more milk follow-up study same thing the more milk follow-up study same thing the more milk the more prostate cancer in this case the more prostate cancer in this case the more prostate cancer in this case 60% so what we believe is happening is 60% so what we believe is happening is 60% so what we believe is happening is that the hormonal effects from the that the hormonal effects from the that the hormonal effects from the milk trigger either the initiation of milk trigger either the initiation of milk trigger either the initiation of cancer or more likely the aggressive cancer or more likely the aggressive cancer or more likely the aggressive growth of cancers that happen to form so growth of cancers that happen to form so growth of cancers that happen to form so rather than having those

So, drinking milk as an adult may not So, drinking milk as an adult may not So, drinking milk as an adult may not help bones. But what about in help bones. But what about in help bones. But what about in adolescence? Harvard researchers decided adolescence? Harvard researchers decided adolescence? Harvard researchers decided to put it to the test. Studies have to put it to the test. Studies have to put it to the test. Studies have shown that greater milk consumption shown that greater milk consumption shown that greater milk consumption during childhood and adolescence during childhood and adolescence during childhood and adolescence contributes to peak bone mass and is contributes to peak bone mass and is contributes to peak bone mass and is therefore expected to help avoid therefore expected to help avoid therefore expected to help avoid osteoporosis and bone fractures in later osteoporosis and bone fractures in later osteoporosis and bone fractures in later life. But that's not what they found. life. But that's not what they found. life. But that's not what they found. Milk consumption during teenage years Milk consumption during teenage years Milk consumption during teenage years was not associated with a lower risk of was not associated with a lower risk of was not associated with a lower risk of hip fracture. And if anything, milk hip fracture. And if anything, milk hip fracture. And if anything, milk consumption was associated with a consumption was associated with a consumption was associated with a borderline increase in fracture risk in borderline increase in fracture risk in borderline increase in fracture risk in men. It appears that the extra boost in men. It appears that the extra boost in men. It appears that the extra boost in total body bone mineral density you get total body bone mineral density you get total body bone mineral density you get from getting extra calcium is lost from getting extra calcium is lost from getting extra calcium is lost within a few years, even if you keep the within a few years, even if you keep the within a few years, even if you keep the calcium supplementation up. This calcium supplementation up. This calcium supplementation up. This suggests a partial explanation for the suggests a partial explanation for the suggests a partial explanation for the longstanding enigma that hip fracture longstanding enigma that hip fracture longstanding enigma that hip fracture rates are highest in populations with rates are highest in populations with rates are highest in populations with the greatest milk the greatest milk the greatest milk consumption. Maybe an explanation why consumption. Maybe an explanation why consumption. Maybe an explanation why they're not lower, but why would they be they're not lower, but why would they be they're not lower, but why would they be higher? higher? higher? This enigma irked a Swedish research This enigma irked a Swedish research This enigma irked a Swedish research team puzzled because studies again and team puzzled because studies again and team puzzled because studies again and again had shown a tendency of higher again had shown a tendency of higher again had shown a tendency of higher risk of fracture with a higher intake of risk of fracture with a higher intake of risk of fracture with a higher intake of milk. Well, there is a rare birth effect milk. Well, there is a rare birth effect milk. Well, there is a rare birth effect called galactomia where babies are born called galactomia where babies are born called galactomia where babies are born without the enzymes needed to detoxify without the enzymes needed to detoxify without the enzymes needed to detoxify the galactose found in milk. So, they the galactose found in milk. So, they the galactose found in milk. So, they end up with elevated levels of galactose end up with elevated levels of galactose end up with elevated levels of galactose in their blood which can cause bone loss in their blood which can cause bone loss in their blood which can cause bone loss even as kids. So maybe the Swedish even as kids. So maybe the Swedish even as kids. So maybe the Swedish researchers figured even in normal researchers figured even in normal researchers figured even in normal people that can detoxify the stuff, it people that can detoxify the stuff, it people that can detoxify the stuff, it might not be good for the bones to be might not be good for the bones to be might not be good for the bones to be drinking it every day. And glactose drinking it every day. And glactose drinking it every day. And glactose doesn't just hurt the bones. That's what doesn't just hurt the bones. That's what doesn't just hurt the bones. That's what scientists use to cause premature aging scientists use to cause premature aging scientists use to cause premature aging in lab animals. They slip them a little in lab animals. They slip them a little in lab animals. They slip them a little glactose and you can shorten their glactose and you can shorten their glactose and you can shorten their lifespan, cause oxidative stress, lifespan, cause oxidative stress, lifespan, cause oxidative stress, inflammation, brain degeneration just inflammation, brain degeneration just inflammation, brain degeneration just with like the equivalent of, you know, with like the equivalent of, you know, with like the equivalent of, you know, one to two glasses of milk's worth of one to two glasses of milk's worth of one to two glasses of milk's worth of glactose a day. We're not rats, though. glactose a day. We're not rats, though. glactose a day. We're not rats, though. But given the high amount of glactose in But given the high amount of glactose in But given the high amount of glactose in milk, recommendations to increase milk milk, recommendations to increase milk milk, recommendations to increase milk intake for for prevention of fractures intake for for prevention of fractures intake for for prevention of fractures could be a conceivable contradiction. So could be a conceivable contradiction. So could be a conceivable contradiction. So they decided to put it to the test. they decided to put it to the test. they decided to put it to the test. Looking at milk intake and mortality as Looking at milk intake and mortality as Looking at milk intake and mortality as well as fracture risk to test their well as fracture risk to test their well as fracture risk to test their theory. 100,000 men and women follow for theory. 100,000 men and women follow for theory. 100,000 men and women follow for up to 20 years.

Three glasses a day was associated with nearly twice the was associated with nearly twice the was associated with nearly twice the risk of death, and they had risk of death, and they had risk of death, and they had significantly more bone and hip significantly more bone and hip significantly more bone and hip fractures, too. Men in a separate study fractures, too. Men in a separate study fractures, too. Men in a separate study also had a higher rate of death with also had a higher rate of death with also had a higher rate of death with higher milk consumption, but at least higher milk consumption, but at least higher milk consumption, but at least they didn't have higher fracture rates. they didn't have higher fracture rates. they didn't have higher fracture rates. So a dose dependent higher rate of both So a dose dependent higher rate of both So a dose dependent higher rate of both mortality and fracture in women and a mortality and fracture in women and a mortality and fracture in women and a higher rate of mortality in men with higher rate of mortality in men with higher rate of mortality in men with milk intake. But the opposite for other milk intake. But the opposite for other milk intake. But the opposite for other dairy products like soured milk and dairy products like soured milk and dairy products like soured milk and yogurt which would go along with the yogurt which would go along with the yogurt which would go along with the glactose theory since bacteria can glactose theory since bacteria can glactose theory since bacteria can ferment away some of the lactose. To ferment away some of the lactose. To ferment away some of the lactose. To prove it though, we need a randomized prove it though, we need a randomized prove it though, we need a randomized control trial to examine the effect of control trial to examine the effect of control trial to examine the effect of milk intake on mortality and fractures. milk intake on mortality and fractures. milk intake on mortality and fractures. As the accompanying editorial pointed As the accompanying editorial pointed As the accompanying editorial pointed out, uh, we better figure this out soon out, uh, we better figure this out soon out, uh, we better figure this out soon as milk consumption is on the rise as milk consumption is on the rise as milk consumption is on the rise around the world.",

going to put a question foods but I'm going to put a question foods but I'm going to put a question mark as to whether that's the reason for mark as to whether that's the reason for mark as to whether that's the reason for the Obesity epidemic that we have been the Obesity epidemic that we have been the Obesity epidemic that we have been seeing because if you look at sweetener seeing because if you look at sweetener seeing because if you look at sweetener consumption over time it went up a bit consumption over time it went up a bit consumption over time it went up a bit over time and as of over time and as of over time and as of 1999 it started falling because people 1999 it started falling because people 1999 it started falling because people started buying bottled water instead of started buying bottled water instead of started buying bottled water instead of soda to a large degree and if you look soda to a large degree and if you look soda to a large degree and if you look at cheese where's that gone up and up at cheese where's that gone up and up at cheese where's that gone up and up and up and up so where which direction and up and up so where which direction and up and up so where which direction is obesity going it's following the is obesity going it's following the is obesity going it's following the cheese well what would that be if if you cheese well what would that be if if you cheese well what would that be if if you look at cheese consumption over time in look at cheese consumption over time in look at cheese consumption over time in 1909 the Department of Agriculture 1909 the Department of Agriculture 1909 the Department of Agriculture started tracking what Americans eat and started tracking what Americans eat and started tracking what Americans eat and in 1909 cheese was something Swiss in 1909 cheese was something Swiss in 1909 cheese was something Swiss people ate we don't eat it in Pura uh people ate we don't eat it in Pura uh people ate we don't eat it in Pura uh the average American could not get the average American could not get the average American could not get through four pounds of cheese in a year through four pounds of cheese in a year through four pounds of cheese in a year but what happened in the 1960s and 70s but what happened in the 1960s and 70s but what happened in the 1960s and 70s and 80s fast food chains came and 80s fast food chains came and 80s fast food chains came in pizza places came in and so cheese in pizza places came in and so cheese in pizza places came in and so cheese became an ingredient in a lot of what became an ingredient in a lot of what became an ingredient in a lot of what people were eating from dayto day and by people were eating from dayto day and by people were eating from dayto day and by by 2013 we were at by 2013 we were at by 2013 we were at 33 pounds of cheese every person every 33 pounds of cheese every person every 33 pounds of cheese every person every year I'm not eating any somebody else is year I'm not eating any somebody else is year I'm not eating any somebody else is eating 60 eating 60 eating 60 so I'm going to argue that it's so I'm going to argue that it's so I'm going to argue that it's fattening for for several reasons number fattening for for several reasons number fattening for for several reasons number one it's loaded with calories and you one it's

pretty low in fat which is why they're not very high in calories so they're not very high in calories so they're not very high in calories so where is where is where is cheese cheese cheese 70% fat if it were any worse it would be 70% fat if it were any worse it would be 70% fat if it were any worse it would be Vaseline so okay there is Coke Zero so Vaseline so okay there is Coke Zero so Vaseline so okay there is Coke Zero so you could actually have a soda without you could actually have a soda without you could actually have a soda without any calories at all but is there cheddar any calories

now the glycogen is stored there too now theoretically you can build fat from theoretically you can build fat from theoretically you can build fat from carbohydrate but even if you ate the carbohydrate but even if you ate the carbohydrate but even if you ate the entire loaf of bread and it was more entire loaf of bread and it was more entire loaf of bread and it was more than you needed and your your glycogen than you needed and your your glycogen than you needed and your your glycogen stores were all filled if you made fat stores were all filled if you made fat stores were all filled if you made fat from it even that to make bread into fat from it even that to make bread into fat from it even that to make bread into fat is hard for your body is hard for your body is hard for your body and it uses up about 25% or so of its and it uses up about 25% or so of its and it uses up about 25% or so of its calories just to try to make it now on calories just to try to make it

people say don't lose cell is you hear people say don't lose cell is you hear people say don't lose your muscle mass your your muscle are your muscle mass your your muscle are your muscle mass your your muscle are your calorie burners you know what I'm your calorie burners you know what I'm your calorie burners you know what I'm talking about okay so inside your talking about okay so inside your

from high school the mitochondria from high school biology those are your calorie burners biology those are your calorie burners biology those are your calorie burners you have a lot of them but you also have you have a lot of them but you also have you have a lot of them but you also have little bits of fat now doctors hate little bits of fat now doctors hate little bits of fat now doctors hate words like fat because it only has one words like fat because it only has one words like fat because it only has one syllable so we'll call it syllable so we'll call it syllable so we'll call it intramyocellular lipid but it's it's fat intramyocellular lipid but it's it's fat intramyocellular lipid but it's it's fat inside your cell and if you ate a little inside your cell and if you ate a little inside your cell and if you ate a little bit too much chicken fat or beef fat or bit too much chicken fat or beef fat or bit too much chicken fat or beef fat or Vita or friy or Grease for that matter Vita or friy or Grease for that matter Vita or friy or Grease for that matter the fat builds up inside your the fat builds up inside your the fat builds up inside your cell when that happens the cell cell when that happens the cell cell when that happens the cell says says says fantastic this is great I've got some fantastic this is great I've got some fantastic this is great I've got some fat that I can store up and if we happen fat that I can store up and if we happen fat that I can store up and if we happen to have a famine some time I'm sitting to have a famine some time I'm sitting to have a famine some time I'm sitting pretty I got a lot of stored calories pretty I got a lot of stored calories pretty I got a lot of stored calories now if the mitochondria burn it all up now if the mitochondria burn it all up now if the mitochondria burn it all up it's gone so when fat comes into the it's gone so when fat comes into the it's gone so when fat comes into the cell the body turns down the production cell the body turns down the production cell the body turns down the production of mitochondri Andria to keep the fat of mitochondri Andria to keep the fat of mitochondri Andria to keep the fat and your metabolism slows down to and your metabolism slows down to and your metabolism slows down to preserve this fat richness that just preserve this fat richness that just preserve this fat richness that just came in and that's the opposite of what came in and that's the opposite of what came in and that's the opposite of what you want you say wait a minute I just you want you say wait a minute I just you want you say wait a minute I just ate too much why are you storing it you ate too much why are you storing it you ate too much why are you storing it you got to get rid of it the body was got to get rid of it the body was got to get rid of it the body was programmed a long time ago when there programmed a long time ago when there programmed a long time ago when there were such things as famines so if you were such things as famines so if you were such things as famines so if you ate a big fatty thing your body says ate a big fatty thing your body says ate a big fatty thing your body says I'll keep that and as the years go by I'll keep that and as the years go by I'll keep that and as the years go by people's the the metabolism you had when people's the the metabolism you had when people's the the metabolism you had when you were 12 is just no longer there you were 12 is just no longer there you were 12 is just no longer there because the mitochondria have been because the mitochondria have been because the mitochondria have been Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan Disturbed so if I'm on a low-fat vegan diet time goes in the opposite direction diet time goes in the opposite direction diet time goes in the opposite direction okay number four cheese does not have okay number four cheese

fiber is big in this lecture I apologize fiber is big in this lecture I apologize fiber is big stuff though fiber is plant roughage it stuff though fiber is plant roughage it stuff though fiber is plant roughage it has effectively no calories and so when has effectively no calories and so when has effectively no calories and so when I eat high-fiber foods it fills you up I eat high-fiber foods it fills you up I eat high-fiber foods it fills you up makes you think you've eaten a lot of makes you think you've eaten a lot of makes you think you've eaten a lot of foods but but the fact is you haven't foods but but the fact is you haven't foods but but the fact is you haven't really eaten very much so fiber tricks really eaten very much so fiber tricks really eaten very much so fiber tricks the brain into thinking you ate a huge the brain into thinking you ate a huge the brain into thinking you ate a huge amount of food but amount of food but amount of food but Vita has no it's not a

okay so why is cheese fattening survey okay so why is cheese fattening survey okay so why is cheese fattening it's high in calories the fat adds to it's high in calories the fat adds to it's high in calories the fat adds to your body fat it slows down your your body fat it slows down your your body fat it slows down your metabolism day by day it doesn't have metabolism day by day it doesn't have metabolism day by day it doesn't have any fiber at all to control your any fiber at all to control your any fiber at all to control your appetite and it adds a little extra it appetite and it adds a

and Bloated okay now you've heard about the Adventist Health study heard about the Adventist Health study heard about the Adventist Health study researchers have studied Seventh Day researchers have studied Seventh Day researchers have studied Seventh Day Adventist for years because Church Adventist for years because Church Adventist for years because Church teachings say don't smoke don't drink teachings say don't smoke don't drink teachings say don't smoke don't drink avoid caffeine don't eat meat avoid caffeine don't eat meat avoid caffeine don't eat meat and almost all Adventists are very good and almost all Adventists are very good and almost all Adventists are very good at the first at the first at the first three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking three um they're nonsmoking non-drinking healthc conscious people but some eat healthc conscious people but some eat healthc conscious people but some eat meat and some do not and that sets up a meat and some do not and that sets up a meat and some do not and that sets up a perfect natural experiment that perfect natural experiment that perfect natural experiment that researchers can take advantage of so the researchers can take advantage of so the researchers can take advantage of so the Adventist Health study too brought in Adventist Health study too brought in Adventist Health study too brought in not quite 61,000 people and they were not quite 61,000 people and they were not quite 61,000 people and they were all over 30 and they split them into all over 30 and they split them into all over 30 and they split them into five groups based on the diets that they five groups based on the diets that they five groups based on the diets that they normally followed normally followed normally followed and they looked at everyone's body mass and they looked at everyone's body mass and they looked at everyone's body mass IND are body mass index are you familiar IND are body mass index are you familiar IND are body mass index are you familiar with that with that with that BMI it's it's just your weight based on BMI it's it's just your weight based on BMI it's it's just your weight based on but adjusted for how tall you are and so but adjusted for how tall you are and so but adjusted for how tall you are and so a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on a healthy BMI is below 25 so the band on the left the Red Band there those are the left the Red Band there those are the left the Red Band there those are nonvegetarians or or basically meat nonvegetarians or or basically meat nonvegetarians or or basically meat eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it eaters and they BMI was not below 25 it was was was 28.8 and the next group were people 28.8 and the next group were people 28.8 and the next group were people called semian Arians meaning they ate called semian Arians meaning they ate called semian Arians meaning they ate meat but only once a week or meat but only once a week or meat but only once a week or less little bit Slimmer the third group less little bit Slimmer the third group less little bit Slimmer the third group The Pesco vegetarians Pesco The Pesco vegetarians Pesco The Pesco vegetarians Pesco meaning okay all right fish they're not meaning okay all right fish they're not meaning okay all right fish they're not eating any meat except for fish they're eating any meat except for fish they're eating any meat except for fish they're a little

vegetarians a little bit Slimmer too and then that fifth group I always have and then that fifth group I always have and then that fifth group I always have to tell my patients that a vegan is not to tell my patients that a vegan is not to tell my patients that a vegan is not a person from the planet Vegas um but a person from the planet Vegas um but a person from the planet Vegas um but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they are not only a lot Slimmer but they're actually the only group smack in they're actually the only group smack in they're actually the only group smack in the middle of the healthy weight range the middle of the healthy weight range the middle of the healthy weight range and so now let's compare the lacto oo and so now let's compare the lacto oo and so now let's compare the lacto oo vegetarians and the vegetarians and the vegetarians and the vegans um I am going to argue that vegans um I am going to argue that vegans um I am going to argue that cheese is one of the biggest cheese is one of the biggest cheese is one of the biggest contributors to the extra weight that we contributors to the extra weight that we contributors to the extra weight that we see with the lacto OS and that see with the lacto OS and that see with the lacto OS and that difference is roughly 15 difference is roughly 15 difference is roughly 15 pounds make sense okay so what the heck pounds make sense okay so what the heck pounds make sense okay so what the heck is cheese well you start with milk this is cheese well you start with

in in Teresa Wisconsin the milk comes in in Teresa Wisconsin the milk comes in in the morning and they pour it in this big the morning and they pour it in this big the morning and they pour it in this big tub and then they add some tub and then they add some tub and then they add some bacteria and that gives it that kind of bacteria and that gives it that kind of bacteria and that gives it that kind of funky smell um because it's fermenting funky smell um because it's fermenting funky smell um because it's fermenting the sugars that are in the milk the the sugars that are in the milk the the sugars that are in the milk the lactose sugar then they add renit and lactose sugar then they add renit and lactose sugar then they add renit and you know about renit this is the enzyme you know about

a plant-based diet you why don't you try a plant-based diet here here's the science of here here's the science of here here's the science of it a cow does not give milk unless the it a cow does not give milk unless the it a cow does not give milk unless the cow has been pregnant and like all cow has been pregnant and like all cow has been pregnant and like all mammals they they're they're pregnant mammals they they're they're pregnant mammals they they're they're pregnant they give birth and they and the milk they give birth and they and the milk they give birth and they and the milk comes out okay so as the pregnancy comes out okay so as the pregnancy comes out okay so as the pregnancy proceeds hormones are produced in the proceeds hormones are produced in the proceeds hormones are produced in the the body of the cow and you can measure the body of the cow and you can measure the body of the cow and you can measure them in the blood plasma they it goes up them in the blood plasma they it goes up them in the blood plasma they it goes up and these hormones end up in the milk and these hormones end up in the milk and these hormones end up in the milk there they go and most of the milk that there they go and most of the milk that there they go and most of the milk that anybody ever drinks or that is on the anybody ever drinks or that is on the anybody ever drinks or that is on the shelves of any grocery store in America shelves of any grocery store in America shelves of any grocery store in America most of it comes from pregnant most of it comes from pregnant most of it comes from pregnant cows because they're pregnant cows because they're pregnant cows because they're pregnant impregnated annually they're kept impregnated annually they're kept impregnated annually they're kept pregnant and they have a lot of estrogen pregnant and they have a lot of estrogen pregnant and they have a lot of estrogen in them um that's a match for your in them um that's a

don't know this affect a woman well I don't know this affect a woman well I don't know but researchers have looked into this but researchers have looked into this but researchers have looked into this and what they found is interesting uh and what they found is interesting uh and what they found is interesting uh some Australian researchers in 2010 some Australian researchers in 2010 some Australian researchers in 2010 brought in a group of women who were brought in a group of women who were brought in a group of women who were postmenopausal postmenopausal postmenopausal meaning shouldn't be having a lot of meaning shouldn't be having a lot of meaning shouldn't be having a lot of estrogen in your blood no matter what estrogen in your blood no matter what estrogen in your blood no matter what and they put them into four groups and they put them into four groups and they put them into four groups depending on how much Dairy they ate and depending on how much Dairy they ate and depending on how much Dairy they ate and the group on the left was the people who the group on the left was the people who the group on the left was the people who were the dairy were the dairy were the dairy avoiders and the other three bars are avoiders and the other three bars are avoiders and the other three bars are the people who have had had Dairy as a the people who have had had Dairy as a the people who have had had Dairy as a regular part of their life and what regular part of their life and what regular part of their life and what seems to really make the difference is seems to really make the difference is seems to really make the difference is do you have it or do you not have it do you have it or do you not have it do you have it or do you not have it once people are having a substantial once people are having a substantial once people are having a substantial amount they tend to have a lot of estrad amount they tend to have a lot of estrad amount they tend to have a lot of estrad in their in their in their blood men don't go to sleep researchers blood men don't go to sleep researchers blood men don't go to sleep researchers at Rochester New York went into a at Rochester New York went into a at Rochester New York went into a fertility clinic and they interviewed fertility clinic and they interviewed fertility clinic and they interviewed men and said are you a low cheese eater men and said are you a low cheese eater men and said are you a low cheese eater half a serving a day no more than that half a serving a day no more than that half a serving a day no more than that or are you a big cheese eater like a or are you a big cheese eater like a or are you a big cheese eater like a serving two and a half servings a day serving two and a half servings a day serving two and a half servings a day and they looked at their sperm counts and they looked at their sperm counts and they looked at their sperm counts and the people who tended to avoid and the people who tended to avoid and the people who tended to avoid cheese had better sperm counts the cheese had better sperm counts the cheese had better sperm counts the people who were Big Cheese folks had people who were Big Cheese folks had people who were Big Cheese folks had pretty low sperm counts now is that pretty low sperm counts now is that pretty low sperm counts now is that because there are female hormones from because there are female hormones from because there are female hormones from the milk because the cows are pregnant the milk because the cows are pregnant the milk because the cows are pregnant and so you're getting estrad with every and so you're getting estrad with every and so you're getting estrad with every glass of milk I don't know but Catherine glass of milk I don't know but Catherine glass of milk I don't know but Catherine said let me give this a said let me give this a said let me give this a try she went totally vegan and she went try

um this is Chad let's talk about asthma um this is Chad let's talk about asthma um this is Chad from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived from Portsmouth New Hampshire he lived right on the water with his brother and right on the water with his brother and right on the water with his brother and his family and Chad was a very active his family and Chad was a very active his family and Chad was a very active kid he loved sports but he could not get kid he loved sports but he could not get kid he loved sports but he could not get through a baseball game because asthma through a baseball game because asthma through a baseball game because asthma would kick in after the exercise or all would kick in after the exercise or all would kick in after the exercise or all the pollen that he was uh breathing in the pollen that he was uh breathing in the pollen that he was uh breathing in and he had every kind of allergy he was and he had every kind of

somebody when he was about 18 said hey could it be dairy hey could it be dairy hey could it be dairy products why don't you why don't you get products why don't you why don't you get products why don't you why don't you get away from dairy and just away from dairy and just away from dairy and just see and he did he tried it and within see and he did he tried it and within see and he did he tried it and within about 3 months not only was his asthma about 3 months not only was his asthma about 3 months not only was his asthma completely gone but so were his completely gone but so were his completely gone but so were his allergies and what's this about somehow allergies and what's this about somehow allergies and what's this about somehow get avoiding these antigens from dairy get avoiding these antigens from dairy get avoiding these antigens from dairy made his body react in a different way made his body react in a different way made his body react in a different way so scientists have looked into this so scientists have looked into this so scientists have looked into this question could dairy products actually question could dairy products actually question could dairy products actually contribute to asthma and if you go on contribute to asthma and if you go on contribute to asthma and if you go on Google and you type in Google and you type in Google and you type in Asma Dairy and the very first thing that Asma Dairy and the very first thing that Asma Dairy and the very first thing that comes up in your search is from the comes up in your search is from

very helpfully gone straight which has very helpfully gone straight in and answered this question for us in and answered this question for us in and answered this question for us dairy foods have often been suggested as dairy foods have often been suggested as dairy foods have often been suggested as a common trigger for asthma but there's a common trigger for asthma but there's a common trigger for asthma but there's little scientific evidence to support little scientific evidence to support little scientific evidence to support this myth and unfortunately most this myth and unfortunately most this myth and unfortunately most Australians are missing out on the Australians are missing out on the Australians are missing out on the health benefits that come from consuming

they sick so I looked at the report that they sick so I looked at the report that they had quoted they they gave references to had quoted they they gave references to had quoted they they gave references to the studies that supposedly show that it the studies that supposedly show that it the studies that supposedly show that it doesn't work and they weren't very big doesn't work and they weren't very big doesn't work and they weren't very big studies but I looked at one one was from studies but I looked at one one was from studies but I looked at one one was from New York University in 1991 had 11 New York University in 1991 had 11 New York University in 1991 had 11 adults they all had asthma and they adults they all had asthma and they adults they all had asthma and they drank either whole milk skim milk or drank either whole milk skim milk or drank either whole milk skim milk or water and what they showed is if they water and what they showed is if they water and what they showed is if they drank whole milk their ability to have drank whole milk their ability to have drank whole milk their ability to have uh gases passed through their lungs got uh gases passed through their lungs got uh gases passed through their lungs got progressively worse from the milk and progressively worse from the milk and progressively worse from the milk and they thought it had to do perhaps with they thought it had to do perhaps with they thought it had to do perhaps with the fatty the fatty the fatty milk so cheese would even be worse then milk so cheese would even be worse then milk so cheese would even be worse then there was a UK study from the United there was a UK study from the United there was a UK study from the United Kingdom it kids they were between three Kingdom it kids they were between three Kingdom it kids they were between three and 14 years of age and they gave them a and 14 years of age and they gave them a and 14 years of age and they gave them a milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and milk and egg-free diet for8 weeks and and the way you test this if if you know and the way you test this if if you know and the way you test this if if you know anybody who has asthma if you have it anybody who has asthma if you have it anybody who has asthma if you have it yourself you try to see if the kid can yourself you try to see if the kid can yourself you try to see if the kid can breathe out if they can have good breathe out if they can have good breathe out if they can have good expiratory flow because that's what expiratory flow because that's what expiratory flow because that's what tends to go bad and what they showed is tends to go bad and what they showed is tends to go bad and what they showed is that if they went egg and dairy free that if they went egg and dairy free that if they went egg and dairy free their ability to breathe out was much their ability to breathe out was much their ability to breathe out was much much much better it really helped them much much better it really helped them much much better it really helped them clear up now this was a study that went clear up now this was a study that went clear up now this was a study that went over eight weeks and it just so happened over eight weeks and it just so happened over eight weeks and it just so happened that Easter was in the middle of that that Easter was in the middle of that that Easter was in the middle of that period so they went to the Chocolate period so they went to the Chocolate period so they went to the Chocolate Factory and said okay do you have Factory and said okay do you have Factory and said okay do you have non-dairy bunnies for us which they did non-dairy bunnies for us which they did non-dairy bunnies for us which they did and these kids got a lot better bottom and these kids got a lot better bottom and these kids got a lot better bottom line is couldn't find evidence that set line is couldn't find evidence that set line is couldn't find evidence that set this aside people haven't really looked this aside people haven't really looked this aside people haven't really looked at it very much at all because no one's at it very much at all because no one's at it very much at all because no one's making money if you stop consuming milk making money if you stop consuming milk

interferes with everything you're trying to do and everything you're trying to do and everything you're trying to do and everybody who has uh migraines has heard everybody who has uh migraines has heard everybody who has uh migraines has heard about these trigger foods um age cheeses about these trigger foods um age cheeses about these trigger foods um age cheeses sausage fermented foods and what they sausage fermented foods and what they sausage fermented foods and what they are telling you as every website on are telling you as every website on are telling you as every website on asthma will say is that these foods have asthma will say is that these foods have asthma will say is that these foods have tyrosine which converts to tyramine and tyrosine which converts to tyramine and tyrosine which converts to tyramine and that tightens up your brain that tightens up your brain that tightens up your brain true however we have seen a lot of true however we have seen a lot of true however we have seen a lot of people have migraines that are triggered people have migraines that are triggered people have migraines that are triggered by other things too and it doesn't by other things too and it doesn't by other things too and it doesn't necessarily have to to be that and at necessarily have to to be that and at necessarily have to to be that and at the hospital for sick children in London the hospital for sick children in London the hospital for sick children in London back in back in back in 1983 they started exploring this they 1983 they started exploring this they 1983 they started exploring this they brought in a group of kids 88 kids and brought in a group of kids 88 kids and brought in a group of kids 88 kids and they put them on an Elimination Diet not they put them on an Elimination Diet not they put them on an Elimination Diet not just eliminating Dairy but other common just eliminating Dairy but other common just eliminating Dairy but other common allergens and 78 of the kids were allergens and 78 of the kids were allergens and 78 of the kids were completely headache completely headache completely headache free and four had a partial Improvement free and four had a partial Improvement free and four had a partial Improvement so this is good now in adults I don't so this is good now in adults I don't so this is good now in adults I don't see quite that degree of success but we see quite that degree of success but we see quite that degree of success but we do see it uh up to about 50% and there do see it uh up to about 50% and there do see it uh up to about 50% and there are a number number of triggers other are a number number of triggers other are a number number of triggers other than Dairy that that sometimes can be than Dairy that that sometimes can be than Dairy that that sometimes can be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be implicated but I think Dairy seems to be the most commonly reported one and if the most commonly reported one and if the most commonly reported one and if you're dealing with migraines and can't you're dealing with migraines and can't you're dealing with migraines and can't function and are stuck on medications function and are stuck on medications function and are stuck on medications day after day it's really really really day after day it's really really really day after day it's really really really worth it to get the dairy out of your worth it to get the dairy out of your worth it to get the dairy out of your diet and see how you do so Lauren's got diet and see how you do so Lauren's got diet and see how you do so Lauren's got no Migra no no migraines anymore all no Migra no no migraines anymore all no Migra no no migraines anymore all right let's talk about rheumatoid right let's talk about rheumatoid right let's talk about rheumatoid arthritis if you look into your arthritis if you look into your arthritis if you look

are one of the ones that Dairy proteins are one of the ones that Dairy proteins are one of the ones that people are sensitive to so researchers people are sensitive to so researchers people are sensitive to so researchers have looked into this and starting with have looked into this and starting with have looked into this and starting with an individual case report back in 1985 an individual case report back in 1985 an individual case report back in 1985 as one girl she had terrible juvenile as one girl she had terrible juvenile as one girl she had terrible juvenile rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor rheumatoid arthritis and a doctor said thoughtful doctor said get away said thoughtful doctor said get away said thoughtful doctor said get away from dairy this could be it symptoms from dairy this could be it symptoms from dairy this could be it symptoms completely remitted and then she went completely remitted and then she went completely remitted and then she went and visited Grandma who would give her and visited Grandma who would give her and visited Grandma who would give her milk chocolate candy and her symptoms milk chocolate candy and her symptoms milk chocolate candy and her symptoms came back and she got off it and the came back and she got off it and the came back and she got off it and the symptoms went away and then a symptoms went away and then a symptoms went away and then a pediatrician said this can't be true you pediatrician said this can't be true you pediatrician said this can't be true you should have milk for calcium her should have milk for calcium her should have milk for calcium her symptoms came back and they went back symptoms came back and they went back symptoms came back and they went back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and back and forth and the pattern became and forth and the pattern became and forth and the pattern became inescapable so they published the uh inescapable so they published the uh inescapable so they published the uh findings in the Journal of the Royal findings in the Journal of the Royal findings in the Journal of the Royal Society of medicine saying here's one Society of medicine saying here's one Society of medicine saying here's one case maybe other people have Diet uh case maybe other people have Diet uh case maybe other people have Diet uh induced arthritis and so triggers have induced arthritis and so triggers have induced arthritis and so triggers have been identified not in everybody but been identified not in everybody but been identified not in everybody but somewhere between 20 and 60% of people somewhere between 20 and 60% of people somewhere between 20 and 60% of people in research studies and in a SL Norway in research studies and in a SL Norway in research studies and in a SL Norway researchers brought in a group of people researchers brought in a group of people researchers brought in a group of people and started them on a juice fast and and started them on a juice fast and and started them on a juice fast and then a vegan diet and then a lacto then a vegan diet and then a lacto then a vegan diet and then a lacto vegetarian diet but within the very vegetarian diet but within the very vegetarian diet but within the very first month they found clear-cut first month they found clear-cut first month they found clear-cut symptomatic Improvement and reduction in symptomatic Improvement and reduction in symptomatic Improvement and reduction in in biomarkers as well uh less pain less in biomarkers as well uh less pain less in biomarkers as well uh less pain less tenderness less swelling and then John tenderness less swelling and then John tenderness less swelling and then John McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan McDougall in Santa Rosa used a vegan just a vegan low-fat diet and found that just a vegan low-fat diet and found that just a vegan low-fat diet and found that within a four-week time frame you saw uh within a four-week time frame you saw uh within a four-week time frame you saw uh improvements particularly in people who improvements particularly in people who improvements particularly in people who are relatively new to having rheumatoid are relatively new to having rheumatoid are relatively new to having rheumatoid arthritis arthritis arthritis okay prostate cancer is one of the most okay prostate cancer is one of the most okay prostate cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer that we have common forms of cancer that we have common forms of cancer that we have obviously and for many many years obviously and for many many years obviously and for many many years researchers have said this is something researchers have said this is something researchers have said this is something that it goes with milk that the that it goes with milk that the that it goes with milk that the countries that have the highest milk countries that have the highest milk countries that have the highest milk consumption that's on the on the right consumption that's on the on the right consumption that's on the on the right hand side they've got the most prostate hand side they've got the most prostate hand side they've got the most prostate cancer well at Harvard the physicians's cancer well at Harvard the physicians's cancer well at Harvard the physicians's health study said in our group of 21,000 health study said in our group of 21,000 health study said in our group of 21,000 Physicians it's true two and a half Physicians it's true two and a half Physicians it's true two and a half servings of dairy products a day every servings of dairy products a day every servings of dairy products a day every day increases your risk of prostate day increases your risk of prostate day increases your risk of prostate cancer about 34% they did another study cancer about 34% they did another study cancer about 34% they did another study called the health professionals called the health professionals called the health professionals follow-up study same thing the more milk follow-up study same thing the more milk follow-up study same thing the more milk the more prostate cancer in this case the more prostate cancer in this case the more prostate cancer in this case 60% so what we believe is happening is 60% so what we believe is happening is 60% so what we believe is happening is that the hormonal effects from the that the hormonal effects from the that the hormonal effects from the milk trigger either the initiation of milk trigger either the initiation of milk trigger either the initiation of cancer or more likely the aggressive cancer or more likely the aggressive cancer or more likely the aggressive growth of cancers that happen to form so growth of cancers that happen to form so growth of cancers that happen to form so rather than having those

        "content": "•Myth: A CALORIE IS A CALORIE\nThe belief that all calories are equal is a widespread myth, even among the well-educated segments of our society. This notion is heavily promoted by the processed food industry to justify the increasing presence of ultra-processed foods in our diets. The argument posits that the source of calories—whether from protein, fat, carbohydrates, or whether the food is whole or refined, cooked or raw—is irrelevant. What matters, according to this myth, is the balance between calories consumed and expended, with any excess supposedly stored as fat in our bodies.\nThis perspective simplifies the issue to a matter of energy balance: consume more than you expend, and you'll gain weight. Consequently, the narrative absolves processed foods of blame, placing the onus on individual discipline to \"eat less and exercise more.\" It reduces dietary advice to avoiding gluttony and laziness, suggesting that any calorie can fit into a balanced diet.\nHowever, Dr. Robert Lustig from UCSF—one of the few remaining independent medical schools in the U.S.—has extensively researched this topic. He points out and I quote “This is the biggest lie in the history of medicine.\" The food industry's vested interest in perpetuating this myth has misled many into believing it's an incontrovertible truth. For instance, the sugar industry once advertised that three teaspoons of sugar were less fattening than an apple, diverting criticism from sugar to other foods.\nThe Fallacy of Portion Control\nThe \"A Calorie is a Calorie\" mantra suggests that a daily deficit of 500 calories should lead to losing one pound per week. However, many people find their weight loss stalls after initial success, leading to frustration. This phenomenon occurs because the human body, intelligent and adaptable, reduces its metabolic rate when it senses a food shortage—a survival mechanism honed over millennia. Our basal metabolic rate can drop, conserving energy during periods of scarcity, similar to how some animals hibernate.\nNot All Consumed Food is Absorbed\nThe first thing to understand is that it is not the calories consumed that matter, it is the calories absorbed that matter. How many calories get absorbed in the body is a function of many factors. Firstly the speed at which the digested food travels through the small intestine and secondly the absorption rate while this food is traveling through the small intestine. Both of these are a function of fiber content of the food. Plant based whole food (PBWF) is full of fiber and as a result it has high motility and travels through the small intestine, where most of the absorption takes place, quite fast. PBWF also has nutrients embedded inside fibers that take time to be extracted. As a result the PBWF gets absorbed only partially and the balance reaches the colon where it feeds the microbes which in turn make essential nutrients for the body. A good example of this is resistant starch present in beans.  When beans are consumed, a significant portion of calories don’t get absorbed in small intestines (hence the title resistant) and move on to colon where our microbes feed on them.  This is also called the second meal effect.\nAnother good example is that of almonds. There are 165 calories in an ounce of almonds but when we eat them, only 135 get absorbed. Where do the other 30 calories go? The fiber in the almonds\nIs both soluble and insoluble. The insoluble fiber forms a mesh like a fishnet and soluble fiber forms a gel which is filling the wholes in the net. Together they create a barrier in the upper part of small intestine which restricts the absorption of starch and glucose into liver. The liver therefore does not get overloaded and new fat is not formed from the fructose which in the absence of fiber does get formed in a process  called de novo lipogenesis (DNL)\nDNL is a complex and highly regulated process in which carbohydrates from circulation are converted into fatty acids that are then used for synthesizing either triglycerides or other lipid molecules. DNL helps keep the sugar and insulin levels down. High insulin level is very harmful as it drives abnormal growth. It drives vascular muscle growth that leads to coronary artery disease. It also causes prostate growth. The 30 calories that did not get absorbed go to the colon where our microbes feed on them.\nAs you can see from two examples above, the calories eaten are not necessarily calories absorbed. This explains why a calorie is not a calorie.\nFood Processing and Its Impact\nThe way food is processed before consumption also affects its health impact. The same 100 calories from sugarcane can vary greatly in their effect on health depending on whether they're consumed as fruit, juice, jaggery, or white sugar.\nPBWF vs. Refined Food\nRefined foods are devoid of fiber as a result they (1) move slower through small intestines taking longer to reach colon and (2) they get absorbed readily as the intestines don’t have to work as hard to extract nutrients from the mesh of fibers. This dual effect makes most of the calories get absorbed in small intestines only, leaving nothing or little for the microbes waiting in the colon. The microbes in colon, when regularly deprived of fibers and starch, start to feed on mucosal layers creating a breach exposing intact protein in food to colon lining made of tight junction epithelial cells. A leak through this layer causes various auto immune diseases.\nCircadian Rhythm\nThe timing of calorie consumption  also matters due to our body's circadian rhythms, affecting how food is processed at different times of the day. Recent (2017) Nobel Prize-winning research has shed light on these mechanisms, highlighting the importance of synchronizing. Dr. Satchin Panda’s research at the Salk Institute in SanDiego has shown that carbohydrates consumed during daytime are handled differently than during night. During daytime they are kept as readily available glucose in the blood and during night they are quickly converted into triglycerides and stored away as fat.\nMacronutrient as a Sources of Calories\nThe source of calories—whether from proteins, fats, or carbohydrates—significantly influences health outcomes. Calories from proteins, for example, affect the body differently than those from fats or carbohydrates. Even within a single macronutrient category like carbohydrates, the impact varies based on the type, such as starch, glucose, or fructose.\nCalories From Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates, which include starches, glucose, and fructose, are metabolized differently in the liver. Starches are converted into glucose by the liver and distributed throughout the body. Table sugar, comprises equally of glucose and fructose and they are processed differently by the liver. Glucose circulates in the blood, while fructose can be converted into glucose for energy or into fat for storage, depending on need which is judged by insulin levels. High insulin levels signifies the sufficiency of glucose in the blood and prompts the liver to convert fructose into fat, which can be stored in subcutaneous fat cells or, if the process is overwhelmed, lead to ectopic fat deposits. This can contribute to conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), visceral fat accumulation, and insulin resistance, the main cause of type 2 diabetes.\nSo once again you can see that a calorie is not a calorie. Glucose calorie is kept as readily usable glucose but fructose calorie may be stored as fat.\nCalories from  Protein\nHuman body is very efficient in recycling protein as a result the protein requirement by the body is rather minimal. So liver converts all extra protein into fat or carbohydrates by a process called deamination. Deamination is the opposite of amination and it is a type of post-translational modification (PTM) in which an amine group is removed from a protein. This process creates organic acids which provide energy (ATP) to cells.\nThis process costs energy, in fact twice as much energy as what it takes to burn carbohydrates. So the net result is that protein provides less calories than carbohydrates, by some estimates as much as 30% less. This explains the popularity of keto diets but this extra burden on liver and kidneys leads to problems in those organs as we age.\nCalories from Fat\nAll fats are 9 calories per gram but it is wrong to think that all fats are equal. Omega-3 fats are very healthy fats but trans-fats are very unhealthy. Trans-fats cannot be broken down by our body cells into energy (ATP).\nWhen we run out of glucose stored in the liver and muscles as glycogen, the body can use fat to provide energy. Theoretically it is correct however in practice the body first sends hunger pangs as a signal to consume more sugar or starch (which provide glucose more readily) before digging into it’s reservoir of fat which is kept for rainy day when food may not be available. So this is another reason a calorie is not a calorie.\nMyth: Exercising Alone Will Take Care of My Health\nOne common myth many young people, who exercise regularly, have is that “Nothing wrong can happen to them because they physically work out regularly”. As a result they become lax in dietary discipline. The data shows that about half of the people, who die after their first heart attack, have no signs of cardiovascular disease. Dr. Robert Lustig of UCSF points this out clearly in his book Metabolical suggesting that of the 8 mechanisms for a healthy body, exercise helps only 4. Food is most important for good health and must not be neglected.\nConclusion\nAs you can see from explanations given above, it is not only what food you eat that matters, it is also what is done to the food and what your body’s metabolic response is to the food that matters. This underscores the principle that not all calories are equivalent, highlighting the importance of considering the source and type of macronutrients in dietary choices.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

Unlike handling excess nutrients, our bodies struggle with deficiencies. Relying on inorganic or organic supplements to address these deficiencies can disrupt our body’s balance.\nFood Supplements Industry\nIn the United States alone the food supplements industry boasts a revenue exceeding $160 billion and is expected to reach $265 billion by 2030. This industry thrives on confusion and doubt, funding studies to make you question your nutrient intake and promote supplement use.\nDepletion of Soil\nIt is an acknowledged fact that today’s plant foods are not as nutrient-rich due to factors like river damming for hydropower, monoculture farming and inorganic fertilizers. These practices deplete essential trace minerals in the soil. When we use inorganic fertilizers, the focus is only on a few key nutrients like Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium etcetera. This depletes the trace minerals in the soil and the food it produces. When we use compost made of human and animal waste these trace minerals are recycled back into soil.\nThe arguments presented by the food supplements industry to point out nutrition depletion in modern plant produce are valid arguments. What is not valid is why should one take supplements instead of eating another carrot or apple to make up for mineral depletion. People are eating fewer fruits and vegetables compared to our grandparents generation. They actually should be eating more to make up for deficiency in nutrients. Eating refined and ultra processed foods further reduce the nutrients in our diet. Our diets are becoming calorie rich and nutrient poor. This is one of the reasons why organic food is richer in trace minerals (besides of course the absence of pesticides). This is also the reason why food grown in the wild, like wild berries, is much healthier.\nWhat About Not-Yet-Known (NYKnown) Nutrients?\nA major problem with supplements is that supplements can only be made of nutrients we know about. But there are likely to be many more nutrients in food which have not yet been discovered. So when we take supplements, it creates imbalances in the not-yet-known nutrients.\nBeta Carotene Study\nTo make my point I like to give the example of Beta Carotene, which is from a family of carotenoids. Beta Carotene was discovered almost two centuries ago and has since been believed to be an important nutrient, just like vitamin C, for heart health. Many cardiologists have been prescribing Beta Carotene supplementation for heart health. However a major study recently revealed that the groups of patients who received Beta Carotene supplementation were dying early compared to the groups that did not. This was quite perplexing and further analysis showed that there are actually 750 types of carotenoids and the human body needs about fifty of them. Our body cells have limited receptors to receive these carotenoids. When we supplement only one carotenoid like Beta Carotene, the receptors get flooded with this carotenoid, not leaving enough room to receive other 49 carotenoids. This created deficiency in these other carotenoids among those groups who received supplementation and led to earlier deaths.\nSymphony of Nutrients\nNutrients behave in complex ways with other nutrients. Reducing them to a single nutrient at a time and consuming does not replicate those processes. As elaborated by Dr Colin Campbell in the documentary “Forks over Knives”, all nutrients work in a synergism, like various instruments in a symphony. Often you don’t even hear the individual instruments, but the symphony is very pleasing and sounds beautiful. To isolate one instrument and enhance it can spoil the symphony. Each of our bodies is like a symphony played out with various nutrients. We know now, after the discovery of Epigenetics, that each one of us has a very different microbiome composition. So it is like each one of us has a body playing out our individual symphony.\nThere are many other examples of nutrient imbalances. Here are few more:\n1. Taking Calcium supplements depletes Magnesium because Magnesium is required by the body to absorb Calcium.\n2. Taking Zinc supplements reduces Copper absorbability and taking Copper supplement creates imbalance in Zinc.\n3. Presence of Phosphorus reduces calcium absorbability as in dairy milk.\nImpact on Liver & Kidney\nAfter food is absorbed in the small intestines all supplements consumed first go to liver, which is the chemical factory in our body. The supplements get metabolized there and filtered through the kidneys. This increases the load on these vital organs, reducing their healthy lifespan. This impact is only noticeable once we reach an old age.\nHow trace minerals and many micro nutrients affect our body is a science that is not fully understood yet, and lot more research has to be done. So the safest approach is to avoid all supplements. Vitamin B12 is the only exception because the municipal water supply that we consume is all chlorinated and kills the bacteria that produces vitamin B12.\nFalse Sense of Security\nTaking supplements can also create a false sense of security and makes us pay less attention to our diet. All nutrient deficiencies should be compensated by consuming balanced meals. We must add foods to our diet that we have been missing. My recommendation is to eat multiple varieties in each food group and specially green leafy vegetables, berries, flaxseeds and walnuts.\nReductionist Approach\nAs the science of nutrition evolved a century ago our focus was on understanding the roles of various nutrients in our body’s functioning.\nThe human mind has limitations and it works better in understanding linear correlations. As a result we tended towards a reductionist approach to nutrition. The role of Vitamin C became clear based on research on sailors who were deprived of fresh fruits and vegetables for extended periods and developed scurvy. The food industry was quick to provide solutions by isolating vitamins to make up for the deficiencies. Creating and propagating this reductionist and deficiency mindset serves the purpose of the Processed Food and Supplements industry well. Nutrition science has focused on these two approaches for the past century and, in spite of the wealth of academic knowledge on nutrition and chronic diseases, one does not see any dent in the growth of such diseases. It begs the question \"Why is that so?\" One explanation is that the field of nutrition has become more about marketing profitable products than educating people about the fundamentals of health and wellness.\nThere is a tendency on many people’s part, who are health conscientious, to look for ways to supplement their diet with healthy supplements. How does one define healthy supplements? Some think plant-based supplements are healthy and others think Ayurvedic or homeopathic supplements are healthy.\nTypical Indian Meal Plan\nA cursory analysis of a typical Indian diet plan shows that we Indians consume over half of our calories from refined and processed foods which are empty calories. Replacing these empty calories with nutrient rich calories from plant based whole foods can easily take care of any nutritional deficiencies and should be the way to go.\nAmerican Gut Project\nA recent study known as the American Gut project (2013-2018) which involved participants from 45 countries showed some interesting results. It concluded that people who consumed a wide variety of plant based foods (over 30 varieties each week) were much healthier than those who consumed few (less than 10 varieties each week). Their immunity from infections diseases was also the highest in the first group. It is for this reason, I recommend that we should try to consume at least seven varieties in each of the five food group each week. The five food groups being Fruits, Vegetables, Grains, Beans & Legumes and Nuts & Seeds. Besides this, one should also eat as many spices as one can each week.\nConclusion\nNutrition is about the synergy of a diverse diet, not just supplementing with isolated nutrients. Embrace variety, focus on whole foods, and question the necessity of supplements for a balanced and healthy lifestyle.\nDr. Colin Campbell, who is considered the top nutritionist in the world today, emphasizes that one must unlearn everything one has come to know about nutrients and only remember that:\n“FOOD, NOT NUTRIENTS, IS THE FUNDAMENTAL UNIT IN NUTRITION.”\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "BASICS OF PHYSIOLOGY\nAfter exploring various myths about diet and lifestyle, we will now delve into the fundamentals of human physiology and nutrition. Every living organism, from single cells to primates, has two primary objectives: (1) survival and (2) propagation. For survival, two elements are crucial, which in Vedanta are termed PRANA and APANA. Prana represents the life-giving force, including food and air (oxygen) for energy, while Apana refers to the elimination of waste produced by metabolism, driven by Prana. In this and the next three blog posts, we will examine the four basic systems of human physiology:\n1. Gastrointestinal Tract: It ingests and processes food.\n2. Respiratory System: It inhales fresh air and exchanges oxygen for carbon dioxide.\n3. Blood Circulatory System: It distributes nutrients and oxygen to every cell in the body.\n4. Lymphatic System: It acts like a janitorial system, removing waste from all body parts due to metabolic processes.\nGASTROINTESTINAL TRACT\nThis tract is the path from our mouth to the anus, through which food passes, is consumed, digested, absorbed, and eventually, waste is excreted.\nAs depicted in the pictures below, food enters our mouth where it is mixed with saliva and chewed into a fine slurry before moving through the esophagus to the stomach via a sphincter valve. In the stomach, food mixes with acids and digests over a period that can range from two to six hours. The total transit time of food, from ingestion to defecation, can vary from 10 to 72 hours, primarily depending on the type of food and gut health. Here's a breakdown:\n- Gastric emptying: 2-6 hrs.\n- Small Intestine transit: 2-6 hrs.\n- Colonic transit: 6-60 hrs.\n- Total Gut transit: 10 to 72 hrs.\nThis transit time largely depends on how nutrients are embedded within the food's fibers. Food lacking fiber moves slowly but is quickly absorbed. In contrast, plant-based whole foods move quickly due to the motility created by undigested fibers but are absorbed slowly, as extracting nutrients like sugars and starches from fibers takes time. This dynamic results in a significant challenge for animal and processed foods, as they are quickly and completely absorbed, leading to liver overload and potential weight gain, with little left for the colon's microbial inhabitants.\nWhen this pattern repeats, our microbial guests become starved and agitated, starting to consume the mucosal layer they inhabit, eventually leading to inflammation and conditions like \"Leaky Gut Syndrome\" or \"Irritable Bowel Disorder.\"\nEPITHELIAL CELL LINING\nThe human gastrointestinal tract is lined with a single layer of epithelial cells with tight junctions, protected by an inner mucus layer containing goblet cells that produce mucus. Adjacent to this inner layer is an outer mucus layer, home to various microbes.\nThe importance and roles of these colon microbes are becoming increasingly clear, giving rise to a new field called epigenetics. Surprisingly, our bodies host more foreign cells (38 trillion microbes) than our own cells (37 trillion). These microbes play a significant role in our health, overshadowing our genetic makeup. This was highlighted in the January 14, 2010, issue of TIME magazine.\n\"Microbiota\" refers to the collective microbes (sometimes called a microbial garden), with \"Microbiome\" denoting their genetic makeup. These terms are often used interchangeably. An analogy to understand the human microbiome versus genome is comparing computer hardware and software: despite similar hardware, the software dictates the functionality, akin to how our epigenome, the body's software, influences gene expression.\nTo make my point clear I like to give an example of cell phones.\nAll cell phones in use today are very similar in terms of hardware however, how this hardware expresses itself visually on the screen or audibly on the speaker depends upon what software is being used. For example Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram all express very differently on the same phone. So our epigenome is our body’s software and it determines how our genes are expressing at any given moment.\nThis understanding is revolutionizing medical science, leading to groundbreaking practices like fecal transplantation which was not even in the realm of our wildest imagination. An overweight woman, who has tried everything in her life to lose weight, loses weight simply upon receipt of a fecal transplantation from a slim woman. Some of the lessons we have learned with this new science suggest:\n1. Same cause can manifest as different symptoms in different people.\n2. Same symptoms can be due to different causes in different people therefore diagnosing problems based on symptoms is an imperfect science distraught with many hits and misses.\n4. A different diet for different diseases doesn’t make sense but a different diet for different individuals could make sense. It is conceivable that soon in future, we may create meal plans based on one’s fecal sample analysis.\nRefined vs. Whole Food\nConsider the example of identical twins T1 and T2, consuming the same ingredients (wheat, peanuts, and apples) in different forms for breakfast. T1 opts for porridge in peanut milk with fresh apples, while T2 consumes refined flour kachori fried in peanut oil with apple juice. T1 maintains health, but T2 may gain weight and risk developing diabetes, liver, and kidney issues. This disparity arises because T1's body might leave some calories for the microbiome, keeping them happy and satisfied, whereas T2's body absorbs all calories in the small intestine, leaving nothing for microbial digestion. This causes microbes to consume the mucosal layer in which they reside. Over time, this can lead to leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\nSugar spikes due to Apple juice and refined flour would result in new fat formation in liver (de novo lipogenesis) causing non alcoholic fatty liver disease and visceral fat and insulin resistance (Diabetes type-2). Ultimately both the kidney and liver will be affected shortening his lifespan.\nThe impact of diet on health is profound, yet often overlooked, with many attributing health issues to bad luck. However, chronic diseases are less about luck and more about the consequences of dietary choices, particularly the consumption of refined and highly processed foods.\nConclusion\nThe transition from whole foods to refined and processed options during the past century is a primary contributor to lifestyle-related diseases. These diseases affect our body on a daily basis in small ways that are rarely noticeable until it is often too late. They are not impervious as we often like to believe. Taking medications to suppress symptoms is not the solution. The diet has to be modified.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Basics of Physiology (2)\nRESPIRATORY SYSTEM\nYesterday we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract, which provides the essential nutrients our bodies need to sustain themselves. These nutrients require oxygen to metabolize and produce energy. The respiratory system is crucial in delivering fresh oxygen to the body and expelling carbon dioxide. While the respiratory system is also involved in sound production and the sense of smell, our focus here will be on the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide.\nWhen we inhale through our nose or mouth, the air travels down the trachea into the lungs, where it divides into multiple branches called bronchioles, eventually reaching tiny sacs known as alveoli. The human lung contains over 600 million alveoli, with their combined surface area roughly equivalent to a tennis court.\nSurrounding the alveoli are blood capillaries that carry blood from various body parts. This blood is rich in carbon dioxide and low in oxygen. Oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs across the alveolar membrane and the capillary walls through diffusion. The picture below shows how an alveolar capillary exchanges carbon dioxide for oxygen.\nDiminished Surface Area\nAt birth, the surfaces of the alveoli and capillaries are pristine, maximizing gas exchange efficiency. However, over time, two significant changes occur. First, dust and pollutant particles accumulate on the alveolar lining, reducing the area available for gas exchange. Second, the capillaries' inner linings develop plaque due to the consumption of inflammatory foods, further diminishing the available surface area. As we age, the reduction in surface area becomes more pronounced, leading to breathing difficulties, a condition known as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD).\nIt is important to understand that obstruction is happening on both sides of that one tennis court size surface of all 600 million plus alveoli of the lung.\nThe obstruction on the capillary wall is due to atherosclerosis which is classified as a cardiovascular disease.\nThe discomfort one experiences in breathing is due to the combination of these two phenomenons working together.\nHistorically, main pollutants like dust and coal particles from wood and charcoal burning prompted people to seek cleaner air in sanatoriums as they aged.\nDiminished Breathing Capacity\nBreathing capacity is another crucial factor. The average lung holds about 6 liters of air, but only a fraction is used during normal breathing. This capacity, which varies among individuals and even within the same person over time, increases with physical activity. Enhancing respiratory capacity through active lifestyles can improve conditions like COPD, as physical activity can help revive some collapsed alveoli.\nSymptoms of COPD include shortness of breath, wheezing, and a chronic cough. The cough is a mechanism by which body clears obstructions, but when these consist of fine particles, the condition becomes persistent. That is why it is called chronic.\nNitric Oxide Gas to Rescue\nConsuming green leafy vegetables and beetroots, which are high in nitrates, release nitric oxide in the blood vessels, aiding in the removal of atherosclerotic damage and improving gas exchange. These vegetables can be consumed as salad or green juice. Additionally, Pranayama breathing exercises like Bhastrika and Kapalbhati can help alleviate respiratory obstructions, offering benefits for those with respiratory conditions.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Basics of Physiology (3)\nBLOOD CIRCULATORY SYSTEM\nIn our past two sessions, we discussed the Gastrointestinal Tract and the Respiratory System, which provide the nutrients and oxygen necessary for survival.\nOnce absorbed, these nutrients need to be transported to every part of the human body, a task accomplished by the blood circulatory system.\nThis system is comprised of a heart that acts as a pump and approximately 70,000 miles of blood vessels, evenly split between arteries (which carry blood from the heart to all body parts) and veins (which return the blood to the heart). At the site where the blood is delivered, these vessels narrow into thin capillaries.\nThe blood vessels' internal lining consists of a single layer of endothelial cells. This network is so extensive that the total surface area of this lining equals about 6-8 tennis courts. Collectively, this surface is known as the endothelium, arguably the largest organ in the human body. When the heart pumps blood, it causes the blood vessels to expand slightly due to pressure, which then drops, causing the vessels to shrink. These fluctuations are known as systolic and diastolic blood pressures.\nNitric Oxide Gas\nA unique feature of the endothelial lining is its ability to release nitric oxide (NO) gas, facilitating smooth blood flow. When blood vessels develop plaque, the effective opening narrows, increasing the friction and, consequently, the blood pressure needed to maintain blood flow.\nEvolution Time Line\nOur bodies have evolved over billions of years. In a hypothetical 500-page book about human evolution, the domestication of animals and the advent of agriculture would appear only in the last paragraph of the final page. I mention this to address common arguments advocating animal-based foods, despite the facts.\nWhat is Inflammation?\nInflammation is the body's reaction to perceived threats, which may not always be genuine. For instance, consider everyday activities that pose no danger because they are familiar. When we rise early in the morning, there are numerous routines we follow that do not alarm us because they are habitual, and we recognize the individuals involved. For instance, a sweeper cleans the street, a newspaper delivery person brings the newspaper, and the regular housekeeper rings the doorbell, to which we respond by letting her in.\nImagine a scenario where the doorbell rings again, and through the peephole, you see a tall, unfamiliar figure. This might trigger a sense of alarm or perceived threat. You might whisper to your spouse to stay silent, pretending no one is home, in hopes the stranger will leave. Alternatively, if your spouse is a retired military officer, he might retrieve a firearm from a safe and loudly inquire who's at the door. There could be various responses to this situation. The individual outside may pose no actual threat and could be a new neighbor seeking directions to the university. Nonetheless, the critical point here is the perception of threat and the consequent reaction, which is analogous to inflammation. In this metaphor, the situation is inflammatory, prompting an 'inflamed' response, which represents inflammation.\nInflammatory Foods\nConsuming plant-based whole foods, which have been part of our diet for millions of years, does not alarm the body. However, introducing animal products, refined, or ultra-processed foods, which are relatively new to our diet, triggers an inflammatory response. Such foods can compromise the integrity of the endothelial lining, leading to the formation of plaques as a repair mechanism.\nATHEROSCLEROSIS\nThis process is called atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis starts early, as soon as children transition from breast milk to solid foods. Continuous consumption of inflammatory foods promotes plaque buildup, narrowing blood vessels and leading to increased blood pressure, hypertension, and other cardiovascular diseases. Atherosclerosis is a leading cause of death in the U.S. and likely worldwide.\nGreen Leafy Vegetables To The Rescue\nGreen leafy vegetables are very rich in nitrates. When we consume them as salads or green juice, they release nitric oxide in the blood, helping unclog the blood vessels. This effect has been demonstrated by Dr. Caldwell Esselystyn of the Cleveland Clinic and Dr. Dean Ornish of UCSF, showing potential in reversing cardiovascular diseases and reducing dependency on medications.\nOne must understand that lifestyle diseases are not random phenomena and they do not develop all of a sudden. They exist on a continuum and the markers like BP are body’s way of compensating for them. Lowering the markers with medication whether Allopathic, Homeopathic, Unani or Ayurvedic is not the solution. One must address the cause which is almost always our diet and lifestyle.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "(4) LYMPHATIC SYSTEM\nSo far we have discussed how nutrients, essential for life, are consumed and distributed throughout the body. With the help of these nutrients every cell performs its metabolic function and in the process creates waste. The gaseous waste carbon dioxide is removed by the respiratory system but other waste is excreted as sweat, urine and feces. The system that collects this waste and takes it to the organs that excrete it (kidney, colon and skin) is called the Lymphatic System. It consists of a large network of lymphatic vessels throughout the body which merge into lymph nodes, lymphoid organs, lymphoid tissues and lymph.\nThe lymphatic system is also part of the immune system. It keeps body fluid levels in balance and defends the body against infections. The way the lymphatic system functions is by removing fluids (other than blood) from body tissues and cleaning it and recycling it.\nMany of the lymph nodes reside in our underarms and where our legs join the body. Interestingly the lymphatic system does not have a pump and relies heavily on the body’s movement specially the hands and the legs.\nThis is one reason why the regular movement of hands and legs is very important. The important function of walking is often neglected by most writers while criticizing the 10,000 steps recommendation. Ideally these steps should be spread throughout the day as much as possible.\nWith this discussion, we've covered four critical systems of human physiology. Next week, we'll delve into the basics of nutrition.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•BASICS OF NUTRITION•\nHaving discussed the basics of physiology, describing how nutrients are ingested and distributed throughout the body and waste is collected and excreted, we will now delve into the types of nutrients and their role in bodily functions. Nutrients are categorized into three groups:\n1. Macronutrients: Provide energy.\n2. Micronutrients: Provide essential nutrients without energy.\n3. Other Nutrients\n1.0 MACRO NUTRIENTS\nMacronutrients are energy-providing nutrients, measured in kilocalories but often referred to as calories. The three macronutrients are proteins, carbohydrates, and fats.\n1.1 Proteins\nWe previously discussed proteins in the context of nutrition myths. To recap, proteins, providing 4 calories per gram, are vital for every cell. They consist of chains of twenty different amino acids in various permutations and combinations. Out of these, nine are essential, meaning our body cannot synthesize them, so they must be ingested through food. A typical human body utilizes approximately 200 grams of protein daily, recycling about 85% of it, leaving a deficit of about 30 grams. The body lacks a storage system for proteins; excess intake is converted into fat and nitrogen in the liver. The fat is stored subcutaneously, while nitrogen is transformed into ammonia, then uric acid, and finally excreted as urine. Excessive protein intake can strain the liver and kidneys, shortening their productive life. This is the reason why dialysis is becoming so common among the baby boomer generation.\n1.2 Carbohydrates\nCarbohydrates are composed of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, providing four calories per gram. They include starch, glucose, fructose, lactose, and glycerols. Starch is converted into glucose in the liver, which is then distributed throughout the body via the bloodstream. The liver can convert fructose into glucose or fat, depending upon the need of the body. This key difference plays an important role in\ninfluencing metabolism significantly.\n1.3 Fats\nFats, offering nine calories per gram, are a dense energy source and the preferred storage form for excess calories. Fats are categorized by saturation level or chain length:\n• Saturated Fats: Each carbon atom is bonded to hydrogen, predominantly found in animal products and considered unhealthy in excess.\n• Monounsaturated Fats: Contain one double bond and are found in plant foods like nuts, seeds and avocados, beneficial for health.\n• Polyunsaturated Fats: Contain multiple double bonds. These include essential omega-3 and omega-6 fats. Of the two, Omega-6 is found in plenty in nature but Omega-3 is scarcer so special attention needs to be paid. Our body needs both omega-3 and omega-6 in equal amounts.\nMany vegetable oils are too rich in omega-6 and have hardly any omega-3.  Any ratio of Omega-6 to Omega-3 higher than 3 is problematic and should be avoided. The richest plant based sources of Omega-3 are Flaxseeds, Chia seeds, Hempseeds, Mustard seeds and walnuts. Mustard which is found in abundance has an omega-6 to omega-3 ratio of 3:1 which is very healthy. That is why mustard seeds should be consumed regularly and mustard oil is the least harmful of all oils.\n• Trans Fats: When oils undergo hydrogenation, they transform into a solid form at room temperature. These hydrogenated oils are known as trans fats and are highly detrimental to health. They gained popularity at the turn of the 19th century when saturated animal fats were discouraged due to heart health concerns. Trans fats are commonly found in products like vegetable shortening and margarine. Owing to their adverse health effects many countries, including the U.S., have banned them. However, they are still permitted in India. Dalda, introduced in India about a century ago, is a prominent example of trans fats; in the U.S., Crisco is a well-known equivalent.\nFats can also be classified by the length of the fatty acid chains, which can be short, medium, long, or extra-long. When we consume whole plant-based foods fiber is digested by bacteria in the lining of our colon, producing short and medium-chain fatty acids that are beneficial to our health.\n(2) MICRONUTRIENTS\nMicronutrients are crucial for health but they do not provide any energy. They include following:\n2.1 Vitamins\nVitamins are essential organic compounds that the body requires in small amounts for nutrition. There is a variety of vitamins readily available in plant-based foods. However, two vitamins that warrant particular attention are B12 and D3. Vitamin B12 is produced by bacteria found in soil, which can enter our bodies through groundwater or direct contact with the soil, such as when farming barehanded and barefoot. In modern times, we often avoid direct contact with soil, and our water, sourced from municipal tanks, is chlorinated, killing all bacteria. Consequently, B12 deficiency is quite common among vegans. Although B12 is present in green water plants, commonly known as seaweeds, which make a regular part of diets in Japan, Korea and China, they are not consumed in India and the rest of the world. These seaweeds can also be good sources of vitamin D3 and Iodine.\n2.2 Minerals\nMinerals are found in air, water, and soil and plants absorb them effectively. These minerals enter our bodies through plant-based foods. However, the use of inorganic fertilizers and practices like monoculture farming can deplete the soil of these vital nutrients and seeds leading to deficiencies in our diet. To counteract this, it is crucial to consume organically grown produce and utilize rock salts, which are abundant in trace minerals. Among these, iodine deserves special attention. It is advisable to incorporate iodine-enriched salts into your diet to ensure adequate intake.\n2.3 Antioxidants\nWhen various metabolic reactions occur in our body, they often release a single atom of oxygen. These oxygen atoms are highly reactive and can cause oxidation of other molecules nearby, leading to a phenomenon known as oxidative stress. Certain chemical compounds, known as antioxidants, are effective in neutralizing these single oxygen atoms. Many plant foods are abundant in antioxidants and consuming them can help reduce oxidative stress. While all fruits and vegetables contain antioxidants, berries, leafy greens, herbs, and spices are particularly rich sources and should be included in one's daily diet.\n2.4 Phytonutrients\nPhytonutrients are phytochemical compounds produced by plants to protect themselves against attacks from fungi, bacteria and plant viruses, as well as from insects and other small animals. In large concentrations, some of these compounds can also be poisonous. Approximately 10,000 different phytochemicals have been identified, but discussing them all is beyond the scope of this blog. However, I would like to highlight two of them: carotenoids and polyphenols. The most well-known carotenoid is beta-carotene, discovered nearly two centuries ago and linked to eye and heart health. It is found in carrots, hence the name carotene. Today, we understand that there are 750 different carotenoids, and the human body requires about 50 of them. Supplementing with beta-carotene was a common practice until recently, but it can lead to imbalances in the absorption of other carotenoids and should therefore be avoided.\nPolyphenols are phytonutrients that help protect body tissues against oxidative stress and associated pathologies, such as cancer, coronary heart disease, and inflammation.\n(3) WATER\nWater is an essential nutrient and must be consumed regularly. The human body does produce some water when it burns fat, but not enough to sustain itself. It is challenging to survive beyond a week or two without water. I recommend consuming two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, even before brushing your teeth. This practice is beneficial because our body produces saliva overnight, which is good for our health. We should swallow this saliva with water. Additionally, one should drink a glass of water an hour after every meal and another glass before going to bed. Except for the water consumed in the morning and at night, which should be drunk as is, it is a good habit to obtain most of your water intake from eating fresh fruits and vegetables, which are primarily water anyway. Hence the saying \"eat your water.\"\n(4) FIBER\nFiber is an essential nutrient that is often misunderstood and neglected. Here are some key benefits of fiber:\n- Fiber aids in the motility of our intestines.\n- It slows down nutrient absorption in our small intestines, allowing certain foods, such as resistant starch, to reach the colon where they serve as nourishment for bacteria.\n- Fiber moderates the absorption of sugar in our liver, preventing its overload. An overloaded liver can lead to several issues, including (1) fatty liver, potentially progressing to Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, (2) the accumulation of visceral fat, and (3) the formation of intramyocellular lipid, which can cause insulin resistance, leading to Type 2 diabetes.\n- Fiber supports the beneficial bacteria in our gut, helping them produce short- and medium-chain fatty acids, which are vital for our health.\nConclusion\nAll nutrients play a crucial role in our health, functioning in a complementary manner akin to a symphony performed by an orchestra. We should obtain these nutrients from plant-based foods, which are their primary sources. It is advisable to avoid secondary sources and supplements.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "FIVE PILLARS OF HEALTH\nWe have so far delved into numerous diet and lifestyle myths that often lead us astray. We've also touched on the essentials of human physiology and nutrition. Today, we embark on a series about what I term the \"five pillars of health,\" key components that bolster our well-being and aid in preventing and reversing many lifestyle-related diseases.\nThe advent of the light bulb and the discovery of antibiotics a century ago marked a societal shift, leading us to normalize disease as an inevitable aspect of aging. The light bulb disrupted our circadian rhythms, spawning numerous chronic health issues, while the triumph of penicillin over infectious diseases fostered a belief that a pill could be the panacea for all ailments.\nPost-World War II affluence ushered in an era of lifestyle diseases like obesity, hypertension, diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. When pills fell short, the medical and pharmaceutical sectors proposed a new narrative: chronic diseases were incurable, pinned on overindulgence and inactivity. Their solution was to manage these conditions by keeping their markers in check with ongoing medication and check-ups.\nMeanwhile, the rise of the processed food industry post-WWII, driven by shareholder profits, led to less nutritious, irresistible food options, contributing to a surge in health issues. This convergence of interests among the food, pharmaceutical, and healthcare industries, overlooked by government and media, has escalated chronic diseases to unprecedented levels, quietly normalizing this unhealthy status quo to a point where we have more sick people than healthy people in the civilized world.\nAcknowledging that diet and lifestyle are at the core of many chronic conditions begs the question: Why not change them?\nThe human body has an innate ability to heal, but relying on medications to mask symptoms interrupts this process, often leading to a cascade of further health complications. The spiral of illness thus created continues untill death.\nStudies of centenarians in \"Blue Zones\" debunk the myth that chronic diseases are a given in old age. These populations live well into their 90s and beyond, largely disease-free.\nThere is overpowering evidence that suggests that there are five pillars of health which contribute to prevention and reversal of most chronic diseases if not all.\n(1) Food\nOur 37 trillion cells require nourishment, which is compromised by modern food processing techniques. Removing fiber and adding harmful ingredients which are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) disrupt our satiety signals and contribute to chronic illnesses.\nNotably, research indicates that a diet with more than 8% protein, particularly from animal sources, can promote cancer. Key dietary rules include avoiding animal products, refined foods, and ultra-processed items.\n(2) Detoxification\nThe food consumed is metabolized by cells throughout the body, producing waste that needs to be collected and excreted. The lymphatic system, nearly as extensive as the circulatory system, facilitates this process. The human brain can only eliminate metabolic waste during the deep sleep cycle at night. In addition to metabolic waste, our bodies also accumulate dead and damaged cells that can harm adjacent healthy cells. The Nobel Prize-winning research from 2016 demonstrated that fasting for over 22 hours induces a process called autophagy, where the body recycles such waste. Thus, it is highly recommended to fast every two weeks, aligning with the Indian tradition of Ekadashi fasts. Furthermore, another Nobel Prize-winning study in 2018 showed that prolonged fasting for 10 days, with only a small, especially low-protein meal each day, enhances immunity against serious diseases like cancer. This practice is strikingly similar to the Indian Navratri fasting tradition. Other yoga practices, such as Shatkarma, are also beneficial for detoxifying the body.\n(3) Circadian Rhythm\nAll species of plants and animals on Earth have evolved within a 24-hour day-night cycle and are well adapted to this rhythm. Many glands in our body release hormones in sync with these cycles, regulating various bodily functions. However, with the advent of electricity, our lifestyles have shifted away from the natural day-night rhythm, disrupting our body's synchronization with nature's clock. Notably, the 2017 Nobel Prize was awarded for research demonstrating how our body's master clock aligns with the day-night cycle. Dr. Satchin Panda's work at UC San Diego and the Salk Institute over the past decade has shed light on this topic. For optimal health, consider the following recommendations:\nSun Gazing: Rise before sunrise and, within half an hour of sunrise and sunset, gaze around the sun, moving your eyes in both clockwise and anti-clockwise directions. Avoid direct sun gazing.\nEating Patterns: Refrain from eating for at least an hour after sunrise and aim to finish dinner before sunset, or at least before it gets dark outside.\nPhysical Activity: Avoid strenuous workouts when it's dark outside.\nScreen Time: Minimize exposure to blue light-emitting screens, such as TVs, computer monitors, and cell phones at night, or use a blue light filter on these devices.\nSleep: Aim for a minimum of 8 hours of sleep per night. Avoid using an alarm to wake up, and compensate for any sleep deficit within the same week.\n(4) Physical Activity\nThe human body has evolved to accommodate a physically active lifestyle. The lymphatic system, which serves as our body's janitorial service, collects metabolic waste. However, unlike the blood circulatory system, it lacks a pump and depends on bodily movement to operate effectively. Therefore, it's essential to move regularly throughout the day. It is advised to engage in movement for 5 minutes every hour while awake. One method to monitor this is by counting your steps, aiming to reach at least 10,000 steps daily.\n(5)  Emotional & Spiritual Health\nHuman emotions trigger the release of hormones that benefit not only our emotional well-being but also our physical health. We commonly hear that laughter is the best medicine because it helps alleviate stress. Similarly, giving unconditional love and surrounding oneself with recipients of such love, like young children and pets, significantly impacts our health. Additionally, prayers filled with gratitude saturate our bodies with hormones that promote happiness and contentment. The act of praying is crucial, regardless of the deity or entity being addressed.\nThese five pillars of health, when consistently practiced and integrated into one's lifestyle, can help reverse many chronic diseases, if not all, and extend one's lifespan. This is similar to the patterns observed in various Blue Zones around the world, where people live over 100 years without diseases. Over next few weeks we will focus on these five pillars of health one at a time.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "•First Pillar of Health•\nFOOD.\nThe most important of the five pillars of health is food. However, it's not just about what we eat; it also matters when we eat, how we eat, and what we do to our food before eating. My experience with 200,000 members has shown that a plant-based whole-food (PBWF) diet is optimal for humans. As we discuss the diet and lifestyle changes needed to treat chronic diseases, we must prioritize the bigger picture. Our goal is to significantly improve one’s health from its current state and to ideally eliminate the need for medications related to lifestyle diseases. My focus is on providing instructions that are simple and easy to remember. Here are my dietary recommendations:\n(1) Avoid Animal Foods\nNo meat, fish, eggs, dairy, or dairy-based products such as yogurt, cheese, and ghee. Here are the reasons for this recommendation:\n- Animal foods are rich in protein. As discussed in my earlier blog (February 11), excess protein must be converted into fat and nitrogen by the liver, then into ammonia and uric acid, causing the liver and kidneys to work harder, potentially leading to the need for dialysis and transplants in later years.\n- Animal protein includes IGF-1, a hormone that promotes rapid cell growth. For example, a newborn calf weighing 50 pounds can grow tenfold to become a 500-pound bull. While human cells cannot grow that fast due to genetic modulation, cancer cells can thrive in the presence of IGF-1.\nA metaphor I use is that while a lawn fed with potent fertilizer cannot grow faster, the weeds within it can. Similarly, tiny cancer cells in our body, common in most civilized populations, can grow rapidly due to IGF-1, thereby promoting cancer.\n- Animal foods lack fiber, which is essential for feeding the microbes in our colon, potentially leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\n- Animal foods are inflammatory and can cause atherosclerosis in our blood vessels, leading to various heart diseases.\n- The fat in animal food is mostly saturated fat, which is detrimental to cardiac health.\n(2) Avoid Refined Foods\n- Refined foods such as oils, sugar, and white flour are devoid of fiber, moving slowly through the intestines, leading to full absorption of macronutrients and leaving little for the microbes residing in the colon. This can cause the microbes to consume the mucosal layer that protects the internal lining of the colon, leading to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases.\n- Refined foods are quickly absorbed, overburdening our liver. This can lead to the formation of unwanted fat in the liver (causing fatty liver and NAFLD), visceral organs (visceral fat), and between muscle cells (intramyocellular lipids). Intramyocellular lipids block insulin receptors in our muscle cells, causing insulin resistance, a precursor to type-2 diabetes.\n(3) Avoid Ultra Processed Foods\nUltra-processed foods, like high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), used as a sweetener in many processed foods, are devoid of fiber and contribute to a leaky gut and autoimmune diseases. Additionally, they contain many chemicals labeled as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS), yet they are not truly safe and cause numerous health issues. For instance, hydrogenated vegetable shortenings sold as margarine, and other products like Dalda and Crisco, have been found to be harmful and banned in many countries.\n(4)  Eat from all five food groups\nThe five food groups are fruits, vegetables, beans & legumes, grains, and nuts & seeds. Regular consumption of herbs & spices is also highly recommended. Aim to consume one-fifth of your daily caloric intake from each food group, though this can vary daily. To accelerate weight loss, consume only the minimum recommended amount from the Nuts & Seeds group. Aim to eat at least 1% of your body weight in fruits (including berries) and vegetables (half from green leafy vegetables) daily.\n(5) Five Nutrients Require  Special Attention\nMonitor these key nutrients closely: Omega-3, vitamins D-3, B-12, and K-2, and iodine. To ensure adequate Omega-3 intake, consume one tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia seeds, along with a few walnuts each day. Include a variety of seeds and nuts; try to eat one Brazil nut each week as it is rich in selenium and also include pumpkin seeds. Take a vitamin B-12 supplement—either 50-100 mcg daily or 2,000 mcg weekly. Vitamin D-3 is best obtained from sun exposure. Only take a D-3 supplement if you are deficient and do not get much sun exposure. For vitamin K2 consume some fermented foods and also sauerkraut. It also helps to consume some sea greens like seaweed and algae as they are rich in iodine, Omega-3 and can provide some vitamin D and B12. Some examples are wakame salad, nori and kelp flakes.\n(6) Keep Your Body Hydrated\nDrink a minimum of half a liter of warm water first thing in the morning before brushing your teeth, a glass an hour after dinner, and another glass before going to bed. Rest of the day, \"eat\" your water by consuming fresh fruits and vegetables rich in water content.\nThe first six of my Daily Dozen recommendations for diet and lifestyle include:\nNo other restrictions are there. Enjoy a variety of foods, including those you like and some you may not. Eat as much as you like but never beyond the point of liking. No portion control is necessary. After a year on the PBWF/IF/10K program (PBWF diet with 16:8 Intermittent Fasting and 10,000 steps daily), you should be able to rely on your body’s instincts to choose food and portion sizes.\nAnother rule of thumb is that at least half of your caloric intake should come from uncooked foods. Following these guidelines should naturally lead to this balance. Consider including sprouted beans to increase your intake of raw foods.\nHow To Cook Without Oil?\nMany Indians feel at a loss because they aren't sure how to cook vegetables without using ghee or oil. Here are a few tips:\n1. Sauté onions in a few tablespoons of water or vegetable stock.\n2. Use spices that have been dry-roasted separately.\n3. Incorporate nut butters like peanut or cashew butter.\n4. Continue with your normal cooking process.\n5. Use air fryers instead of deep frying, or opt for baking.\n6. Add avocados to dough for making rotis or stuffed parathas. Avocados contain 80% fat.\nPlease note that in my recommendations, you are permitted to use nut or seed butters (pastes). This ensures that all dishes, including Pulao and Khichri, turn out perfectly. The only exceptions are deep-fried dishes, but you can use air fryers for those.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "Pillar-1 Food: Meal Plans\nMany people request daily meal plans due to confusion about what to eat. As outlined in my guidelines from last week, our diet program offers complete freedom in choosing foods, provided they are plant-based whole foods (PBWF) and consumed within a narrow daytime eating window of 8-10 hours. Starting your day with green juice, fruits, nuts, and seeds for breakfast covers three of the five essential food groups, giving you flexibility for lunch and dinner. Here are some guidelines for a daily PBWF meal plan, assuming your eating window is from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Adjustments can be made for different eating windows.\nBREAKFAST\n10:00 AM: A glass of green juice\n10:20 AM: A large bowl of fresh fruits and berries\n10:30 AM: Oatmeal or porridge made with nut milk and dates as a sweetener. Idli, Poha, Upma or similar PBWF items. This meal can also be combined with lunch, the choice is yours.\nLUNCH\n12:40 PM: A glass of green juice\n1:00 PM: Choose any PBWF dish made with grains, beans, legumes, or starchy vegetables. Examples include Daal/Roti, Daal/Rice, Khichri, Peas Pulao, Bisibhili Bhat, Idli, Dosa, Uttapam, Upma etc.\nSNACK (Optional)\n4:00 PM: Tea or coffee and/or fruits and/or dry fruits\nDINNER\n5:10 PM: A glass of green juice or  salad.\n5:30 to 6:00 PM: Any PBWF dish of your choice.\nNote: The third glass of juice can be eliminated once you are off all medications, and the second glass can also be stopped after a year of no medications. Ensure you meet your daily intake of one tablespoon of Flax/Chia seeds and a few walnuts, although those watching their weight may limit this amount. Also, take a Vitamin B-12 supplement, with any meal. Remember, there is total flexibility with the meal menu.Any grains, beans, legumes, and starchy vegetables are acceptable.\nYou can make anything out of dosa batter; it takes care of two food groups:\nDaal\nRice\nIn the long run your body will guide you, by making you feel like eating one thing or the other. After 12 months on PBWF diet, you cannot go wrong, if you listen to your body.\nIt would not be possible today,because there might be some unhealthy habits that need to be overcome first. It is a good idea to include a salad in your meal or have a salad as a meal.\nMeal Plan Suggestions\nMany people ask me as to what I eat for meals and what can be made with zero oil and zero sugar. Here is a list of foods regularly consumed at our home.\nA. 100% Compliant Selections\nSuitable for those trying to reverse chronic diseases and wean off medications:\n1.

        "content": "••• GREEN JUICING •••\nBased on my experience in various health groups, I'd like to share four key insights:\n1. Ease of Adoption:\nSome health advice is easier said than done. For example, consuming green leafy vegetables without using oil or ghee is challenging in Indian cuisine, where saag is a common preparation requiring these fats.\n2. Dietary Changes:\nIt is often hard to give up our favorite foods even when we know they are unhealthy. However, introducing tasty, healthy options can naturally displace less healthy choices.\n3. Impact of Changes:\nGradual changes often yield less noticeable improvements which can lead to a loss of confidence. Making a few dramatic changes can keep these efforts top of mind and encourage persistence.\n4.Ripple Effects:\nA single conscious change can lead to multiple subconscious improvements and accrue significant benefits. For example, starting a daily walking routine led me to naturally reject calorie-dense snacks like cookies and donuts, mindful of the effort I'd put into walking.\nWhy Green Juice?\nGreen leafy vegetables are high in nitrates, which help release Nitric Oxide in the bloodstream, unclogging blood vessels and reducing blood pressure and other cardiovascular issues.\nWhen I discussed dietary guidelines I mentioned that we need to consume a minimum 1% of our body weight in vegetables and half of that should be in green leafy vegetables. Dr. Caldwell Esselstyn suggests six daily servings of green leafy vegetables for heart patients, including notable individuals like Bill Clinton. Given the culinary habits in India where salads are uncommon, I recommend juicing as a practical alternative, although it's second to consuming greens raw or blanched.\nI recommend watching the documentaries “Fat, Sick & Nearly Dead\" available on Netflix, and \"Super Juice Me\" on YouTube. These showcase dramatic health transformations through extended juice fasts. Inspired by these, I started with a five-day juice fast 11 years ago that transformed my life.\nOne should start with a 3-5 day juice fast, consuming 8-12 ounces of juice four to five times a day. After that continue with three glasses daily 15-20 minutes before meals to maximize health benefits until you can reduce or eliminate chronic medications.\nThe main goal here is to consume large quantities of green leafy vegetables (fruits should be eaten as a whole or to just make vegetable juice tastier). Juicing makes it easy.\nSelecting A Juicer\nAs green juicing is an important component in my dietary recommendations the selection and purchase of a juicer should not be delayed, especially for people who are on medications or want to lose weight.\nConsider hydraulic, double helical screw, and single augur juicers based on your budget and needs. Avoid high-speed centrifugal juicers as they can degrade nutrients and are less effective with leafy greens.\nFor patients who are critically ill, it is advisable to consume juice with minimum pulp. It is light on their stomach and for the same amount of fullness, they can consume more nutrients. (Not sure you need the last line re: cancer here since you mention critically ill above).\nDo You Lose Fiber?\nA question often asked is “aren’t you removing fiber in juicing?”\nThe answer is that there are two types of fiber- soluble and insoluble. Juicing retains soluble fiber and some of the insoluble fiber as well. One should eat fruits as a whole and juice only vegetables. You can add some fruit to enhance the taste and yes Granny Smith apples because they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables.\nThere is a saying: First thing in the morning, if you poop before you finish peeing; you are in good health. You soon will experience that.\nGreen Juice Recipe\nBefore diving into the recipe, it's important to note that there isn't a strict chemical composition required for making juice. Unlike the precise formulations often found in Ayurveda, the primary aim of juicing is to enjoy consuming green leafy vegetables in a tasty beverage, rather than enduring a bitter concoction solely for health benefits. Since everyone's taste preferences vary, feel free to adjust the ingredients according to your liking. The goal is to create a juice that's so delicious, your guests will ask for a second glass.\nConsider the recipe as consisting of three main groups of vegetables, along with some seeds:\n1. Apples and Spice Group: This includes four Granny Smith apples (or any other suitable juicing apples), two lemons, and two thumb-sized pieces of ginger.\n2. Hydration Group: Comprising one bunch of celery, one large English cucumber (or two medium regular cucumbers), and/or lettuce. This group provides most of the juice's water content, and you can easily double these ingredients if desired.\n3.Leafy Greens Group: Choose any combination of one to three of the following: kale, chard, spinach, mustard greens, turnip greens, collard greens, beetroot greens, cabbage, etc. (2-3 bunches total). Alternatively, for a variation, replace this group with carrots and beetroots.\nEnhance your juice by adding some flax seeds, chia seeds or hemp seeds. These seeds not only fulfill part of your Omega-3 needs but also provide fats that aid in nutrient absorption. Don't hesitate to include other non-starchy vegetables like bottle gourd, butter melon, raw turmeric, and mint. There are no restrictions—let your taste buds guide you!\nHere is a typical green juice mixture in my kitchen. See in the picture from left to right:\nChard, Kale, Arugula, Bottle Gourd, Romaine lettuce, Celery, Cucumber, Lemon, Ginger, Beetroot, Raw Turmeric root, Green apple, Carrot and Fenel.\nShelf Life\nJuice can be stored safely in airtight glass bottles in the refrigerator for up to 72 hours or frozen for longer storage, leaving space for expansion.\nOrganic vs Nonorganic\nAlways thoroughly wash fruits and vegetables. Seek organic sources if possible, but don't avoid conventional produce out of fear of pesticides; the benefits of consuming fruits and vegetables outweigh the potential risks.\nI recommend that you find good sources of organic produce. See if there is a farmers market near you. Some organic farms have now started delivering fresh produce at home. There are also community farms who deliver produce every week. I strongly recommend that you befriend your grocer more than your doctor. He is more important in your life. Next Diwali give him a box of dry fruits. He will remember you and always tell you if a particular produce is not good and should be avoided.\nJUICE vs SMOOTHY\nThis is one of the most frequently asked questions and there clearly is big confusion on this subject, so I have decided to dedicate a post to this. Before proceeding I want to make it clear that eating leafy greens raw as salad or blanched is the best option. The chewing action in the mouth mixed with saliva provides the most nutrition and absorption. Fruits ofcourse shoul always be eaten as whole fruits except some green apples (Granny Smith variety in US as they have enzymes that help digest green leafy vegetables) which should be added to green juice. So the question is only, what is the second best option.\n1. Smoothies require high speed blending, this makes the air oxidize the nutrients. So you have some nutrient loss due to oxidization.\n2. Because you have to mix a cup of water to start the process and because the pulp is retained, there are only half as many nutrients in a glass of smoothie as opposed to a glass of juice.\n3. Because of air and insoluble fiber you can not consume much smoothie and make up for reduced nutrients by drinking more. On the contrary the juice feels less filling than smoothie.\n4. A good juicer retains most of the soluble fiber in juice. Some of the insoluble fiber is also retained in small particles that go through the screen. The remaining insoluble fiber which is rejected, has little nutrient left. It is also not needed for bowl movement because one gets more than enough from juice.\n5. Juice does not stay in stomach much and passes through to small intestine quickly. Smoothies need to be digested and remain much longer in the stomach. Smoothies are not a good choice for juice fasts.\n6. Juice has a much longer refrigeration shelf life. You can juice only twice a week and store it in airtight glass bottles. It can also be frozen so one can reduce juice making to even once a week.\nThis post clarifies green juicing, its benefits, and its practical implementation, aiming to promote better health practices and dietary adjustments.\n—————————————\nEND OF POST\n—————————————",

        "content": "• HOW MUCH WATER SHOULD YOU REALLY DRINK?\nSocial media is awash with adviceeon water consumption—recommending specific amounts to drink daily, detailing when and how to drink it, and even touting it as a cure for numerous ailments. My aim with this blog is to address these topics and clarify the confusion created by such claims.\nThe renowned Mayo Clinic suggests a daily water intake of 2.7 liters for women and 3.7 liters for men. While it's true that dehydration can lead to health issues, many of the claims about water curing illnesses are exaggerated and lack evidence. I recently spoke with a cancer patient who had increased his water intake to 3 liters per day in hopes of healing. While this hope is not harmful as long as he continues with necessary treatments like surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, and avoiding angiogenic foods, it's important to set realistic expectations.\nWater is crucial for maintaining various balances within the body, such as pH and mineral levels. Consider a New Yorker who subsists on a diet rich in meat, potatoes, coffee, and alcohol, with little to no water consumption; they might experience health issues that could be somewhat alleviated by drinking more water. However, this doesn't imply that increasing water intake can cure all individuals suffering from similar ailments. This is a common misconception promoted by many online videos and claims.\nBy understanding the true benefits and limitations of water consumption, we can approach our health more effectively and avoid falling for unfounded claims.\nBenefits of Drinking Water\n- Improves blood volume and viscosity\n- Boosts your energy level\n- Flushes out toxins and keeps your organs healthier\n- Improves skin\n- Promotes weight loss\n- Enhances muscle contraction\n- Improves hormone production\n- Reduces joint pain\n- Reduces stress hormones\nThe amount of water you need depends on several factors including your health, activity level, climate, and importantly, your diet—a factor often overlooked in mainstream media.\nWater aids in maintaining both alkalinity and sodium levels, suggesting that a diet high in alkaline foods and low in sodium (typically unprocessed) may reduce the need for excessive water to eliminate acidity or salt.\nIn a climate with temperatures ranging from 15-25 degrees Celsius and dry air (such as an air-conditioned environment), and assuming an activity level of 10,000 steps per day, a useful guideline is to drink 3-5% of your body weight in water. For instance, a person weighing 75 kilograms should consume 2.25-3.75 liters of water daily, equivalent to 9-15 glasses, assuming each glass holds 250 ml. If you're consuming 1% of your body weight in fresh fruits and 1% in vegetables daily (which are about 85% water), this accounts for approximately 1.7% of the 3-5% hydration needs. Thus, the remaining requirement is reduced to 1.3-3.3%, or 4-10 glasses of water daily.\nFor those avoiding non-vegetarian and processed foods, I suggest that 6 glasses per day may suffice. Consider drinking two glasses of warm water first thing in the morning, one glass an hour after each meal, and one glass before going to bed. In hotter climates, like in India, it's advisable to drink a glass of water every time you come back from an outdoor trip. However, it's possible to drink too much water, which can lead to a loss of mineral balance. A practical way to assess your hydration level is by checking the color of your urine, which should ideally be at level 2 on a scale from 1 (clear) to 5 (dark yellow).\nNote that acidic beverages and some types of acidic bottled water do not contribute to your total daily water intake.\nWater with Meals or Not ?\nIs it beneficial to drink water with meals? Opinions vary. Some sources recommend drinking warm or room-temperature water during meals to aid digestion, similar to the custom of drinking lukewarm green tea in Chinese and Japanese cultures. Others suggest waiting 45 minutes to an hour after eating before drinking water, claiming that it dilutes stomach acids and impairs digestion—though this lacks substantial scientific backing. The Mayo Clinic states that drinking water does not interfere with digestion.\nAn often overlooked factor in this debate is the type of food being consumed. For meals consisting of solid foods with low moisture content, drinking water or tea is advisable to aid in digestion. Many baked goods, such as bagels, muffins, cookies, or sweet potatoes, are difficult to swallow without the aid of a liquid. Similarly, most baked animal foods, unlike moisture-rich Indian curries, are low in moisture and may require water with meals.\nFor those adhering to a diet rich in plant-based whole foods, which includes a substantial amount of fruits and vegetables and retains water and gravy in cooked items, there is less need to drink water during meals. However, I recommend taking one sip of water before starting to eat and a couple of sips at the end of the meal to aid in the functioning of the esophageal sphincter muscles and to facilitate oral hygiene. This aligns with the Hindu practice of taking a little water in your palm and circling it around your plate and swallowing it as a prayer before eating, and rinsing the mouth after meals. If it's not always feasible to spit the water out, swallowing it is perfectly acceptable, as it contains only the consumed food.\nWater can be consumed during the meal if necessary, but it is advisable to drink it before starting and waiting about 45 minutes to an hour after finishing the meal.\nTulsi, Moringa or What?\nA common question I encounter is about the practice of consuming various substances with morning water or on an empty stomach. It's crucial to understand that every plant food offers some benefits, but it's misleading to consider them in isolation. In India, it's widespread practice to add certain items as \"superfoods,\" to your morning water.\nMost plant foods contain vitamins and minerals, their presence alone, as highlighted on social media, does not necessarily make them superior. Additionally, there's a practical issue with the advice to consume something on an empty stomach: how do you decide which should go first?\nOnce you have consumed one item, your stomach isn’t empty any more.\nI'm not opposed to consuming these items, but I advise treating them as part of your regular diet, not as supplements, and especially not outside your normal eating window. Believing they can compensate for deficiencies in your diet or lifestyle is a mistake. Here are some examples I often see: Lemon, Apple cider vinegar, Tulsi, Methi seeds, Moringa, Jeera, Ginger, Garlic, Aamla, Turmeric, Cinnamon, Curry leaves. The list goes on and on.\nMy recommendation is to incorporate these into your recipes rather than consuming them as supplements, whether first thing in the morning or last thing at night. Consume them during your designated eating times, not during fasting periods.\nTea, Coffee or Chocolate ?\nOn the topic of tea, it's interesting to note that the British introduced tea to India around 180 years ago during their trade conflicts with China. While tea does contain some nutrients, the benefits are often offset when milk and sugar are added. A healthier alternative would be herbal teas, such as hibiscus, ginger, lemon, or cinnamon, which provide more nutrients without the need for additives like milk and sugar.\nCoffee, similarly, is not native to India. It was first introduced to the Karnataka hills in the 1670s. The issue with beverages like tea, coffee, and chocolate lies in the caffeine content, which is addictive—similar to other substances like tobacco, marijuana, alcohol, and opium. Addiction can dominate your life, dictating your actions and even basic functions like using the bathroom. Skipping your usual dose can lead to headaches and a general inability to function. Thus, I recommend trying to break free from this dependency. Some people may succeed in quitting cold turkey while others might prefer a gradual approach.\nFrom a health perspective, all three beverages contain nutrients that are beneficial, but not when consumed in the typical way with added milk and sugar, which offset these benefits. If you choose to consume them, it's best to do so without these additions and in moderation. Consider starting by eliminating milk and sugar from your beverages. Opt for black tea with lemon or cardamom, or try Kashmiri Kahwa, which contains neither sugar nor milk. Green tea is another excellent option.\nYou might also notice that biscuits or donuts often accompany tea or coffee with milk. Eliminating milk from your tea or coffee can make it easier to stop consuming these snacks as well. I personally quit drinking tea ten years ago. For first few years I missed the routine of having a cup of hot beverage in the morning now even the idea doesn’t cross my mind.

        "content": "I've seen family members beyond suffer at the hands of disease. I've lost family members at the hands of disease. My mum is an example which I find incredibly difficult to talk about. The reason why I'm doing this documentary comes down to my mum. I've got no brothers, I've got no sisters, I've got no father, I didn't know him. My mum was my mother, my father, my brother, my sister, my world. And she's now no longer with us. She actually had stage IV lung cancer. They said she had COPD and they gave her an Asthma pump. Even if the doctor thought she had COPD, I thought: there has to be another way! Let's get to the cause of the problems instead of treating the symptom. My mother saw this place before it was built. We stood here, she said: \"You have to build this.\" \"This may be too late for me, but you have to build it so that people have somewhere to go where they can heal.\" I vowed that if there is anything I can do to evoke change, to try and help somebody, to say: \"Maybe there is another way.\" That's what we're going to find out. We're seeing an increase in cancer and diabetes. It doesn't matter now that you're 10 years old or 80 years old. All ages are plagued with very serious illnesses. It's getting more dangerous and more difficult to keep your defenses up. We're chronically over toxified. Toxins in the medication we're taking, toxins in the food and water supply. These lifelong medications have lifelong side effects in millions and millions of people. There's no question in my mind that we're not winning the war on disease. We're at a crisis point! If something doesn't change, all these disease are going to escalate. Hello Jason! I'm going already. Crohn's disease, that's what I have. Oh, I’m so stupid… I can't believe I'm crying so much. The majority of my life I've spent ill, sick. I think it's a very difficult thing to live with. Just effected every single aspect of my life. My number one problem is Ulcerative Colitis. I don't take medication because all of the medication that they prescribed had steroids and I started getting cataracts in both my eyes. I'll tell you what this shows me: How many people that medical intervention is clearly not working! All of this stuff is not natural and shouldn't be happening to a 26-year-old. Now on a daily basis these are some of the medications I take. I'm now carrying 135kg, and I cannot carry this weight. There are so many massive issues to deal with. I have a very long list of ailments. I can say honestly I've not felt well for 25 years. I don't see that changing. I need to try, but at my age who knows how that's going to go. I don't know if SuperJuiceMe is going to work for everyone. But you can't not try. I'm very overweight and I've tried everything to lose weight. She represents so many people out there. I need to do this, for my health, for my children. The last thing I'm going to try will be weight loss surgery. Please pick me, I've tried everything. To be able to be in a position where there's a chance that this experiment could possibly help even one of them. Then it's been worthwhile. In fact you can't watch any of these videos and not care deeply. Well, they're here! The SuperJuicers have arrived, in the middle of nowhere, in Portugal. Here at Juicy Oasis they are going to embark on a journey of having nothing but freshly extracted juice for 28 days as part of my big juice experiment. My name is John Zorrer, I’m 29 years old I've got Ulcerative Colitis which is an auto-immune disease. I'm a 29-year-old who should be having the time of my life. I should be able to do all sorts of things. I feel like I'm 60 years old! I can't do normal things or I don't want to do them because I feel like I'm going to be sick and it's just not fun. My name is Estelle, I'm 26. When I was 17, I developed Asthma. I get really shaky after I take my inhaler. I don't see that as being a definite solution or a cure of any sort. It's going to help you with the shortness of breath but it's not going to help you with the asthma, it's just going to help you get through the day not the whole month or life. Hi I'm Betsy Pauly. I will be 52 next week I have a long list of problems. It started with lupus about 23 years ago. I don't know what it is to feel good. If you were to ask me today I would tell you that I feel good. But my good is not your good. Because you can look healthy. I mean, you walk around, you get the job done. I mean, being a mother you always get the job done. I'm Roger Gale and I'm 67 years. I've got sleep apnea and so I have to wear a breathing machine at night. I have hyperglycemia and worst of all, I have lupus. I know that there are many people in far more unfortunate circumstances but I've been relatively healthy and active for all of my life without any illness, so it comes as horrible shock to me. The worst aspect is that I cannot do all of the things that I plan to do. My name is Sarah Crosby, I'm 22. I was diagnosed with Crohn's disease when I was 10. It can affect any part of the digestive system from the mouth to the back passage. Unfortunately, I have it everywhere. I'm a big believer in the fact that fruits and vegetables can help you. If that didn't happen and my Crohn's got worse it would really hit home that maybe I will be on medication for the rest of my life. My name is Lewis. I'm 22 years old. I've got problems with my weight and being able to walk and things like that. I use food as a massive blanket. I use it when I'm happy I use it when I'm sad I use it as a reward I use it for everything. It's so annoying because I don't want to be addicted to food. I'm Erika, I'm 33. My weight is my first problem. I'm obese. Running around after the children, I can't really do that because of my size. We should be able to go out at the weekend at the park. I can't! I've got two beautiful kids that need their mum. I feel like I'm letting them down. My name is Andrew Morris. I am 51. I suffer with a condition called pulmonary sarcoidosis. I've also got asthma, atrial fibrillation, sleep apnea and Type II Diabetes. It's weird for people to understand, but I can go to sleep and dream of waking up and just not taking tablets. I originally planned to have 6 of them but after seeing all their videos there was no way that I could only pick 6, so there are 8 of them here they have 22 different diseases between them. It's going to be interesting to see what happens, mentally and physically when they're just living on juice for 28 days. So if the the medical profession seems unable to treat these guys, why do I think I can help? Well, I have a theory and it all starts with a fish. Think of a fish living in natural, clean, nutrient-rich water. The chances are it will live a disease-free life. But would will happen to the fish if you pollute the water? If you poured, say, cola into the bowl? Or some salty potato chips? Or greasy fatty foods like burgers and pizza? What do you think is going to happen? Well, all living creatures have a natural filtration system that can handle a certain amount of just about anything. But if you keep adding more junk into the water the body is going to start to struggle. The poor fish is going to start showing symptoms of \"disease\". It might get a skin condition. It might get asthma. It might become fat or obese. Perhaps it gets a headache or a cough. It might get arthritis and can't move its fin so well. These symptoms are warning lights telling the body there's something wrong. So what's the best way to treat the fish? Medical intervention might suggest that you give it medicine to treat the headache. Or a different medicine to stop it coughing. Or further medicine to help it move its fin. Perhaps more medicines to treat the side-effects of the first medicines. That might treat the symptoms but even the medicines add pollution to the bowl. It seems painfully obvious to any rational thinking person what the solution is. Would you want to give the fish more medicine? Of course you wouldn't! The answer is so simple. If you want to treat the cause of the problem, you need to clean the water. So that's effectively what our SuperJuicers are here to do. To clean the terrain where their cells bathe to clean \"the water\" in other words. It's that simple! All chronic degenerative diseases are caused by two major problems: toxicity and deficiency! We're living in an over-toxic world, and we're living at a time where we're also consuming foods that are devoid of nutrients, and as that toxicity and deficiency becomes manifested in our body it results in disease. We have to detoxify, and flood the body with nutrients. We should address the toxicity and replenish the nutrients in our bodies if we're looking to heal ourselves. Once you understand the cause you got the answer for the cure! The thing that got me into juicing was the fact that it made so much sense. It was the perfect way to get \"live\" nutrition going into my body because even to this day I still don't like certain vegetables. I hate broccoli with a passion! You've got to remember, I was a junk food addict. So to go from that to broccoli, my taste buds didn't really want to know. I read a book that said that all fruits and vegetables was full of over 85% pure organic liquid fuel and it's only this fuel that fed the body. It's rapid nutrition into the cells. The idea of rapid nutrition really appealed to me. I thought: \"If I can't eat them, can I drink them?\" I'll be honest, the thought of drinking broccoli juice was even worst than the thought of eating it! But you know what? When you extract the juice and mix it with a little bit of apple a little bit of pineapple a bit of pear, some ginger and if you try different combinations. I got so excited! I remember even to this day, I called my mum I said: \"Mum you'll never guess what! I'm drinking vegetables!\" This has got to be good for you! It's fresh fruits and vegetables converted into juice right there on the spot! How can you do better than that? Do you see how simple this is? These plants contain all the elements of life and growth in them. I tell you now, if there is a system that can get me to have vegetables then I knew this would work for anybody! I am absolutely ready for the journey. It's a journey to health, to learning about what nutrition can do for my body. This opportunity, it's the mark of a new start, of a new life for me. I'm kind of scared of a whole month, it sounds like a lot! People have done it. I'm not someone who usually has that type of drive. If you took the medication out of the equation I could live a normal life. And that's what I'd like. I think that's going to give it to me. So, here we go! [MUSIC] Eurgh! Ooh! That's all right isn't it?! Thanks! It's not as bad as I thought! I like it! The orange is disgusting, could I have some more wheatgrass please? [MUSIC] Pow! I've been on the juice for nearly 2 days now and surprisingly, I feel very good! Actually, I feel really good! I feel pretty terrific! [MUSIC] There we go! On the 13th of July 1962, I was born. And I feel now I'm going to be reborn. It's my rebirth! That's it! Thank you! Let's turn that off. Craving food today. Craving a lot of food. I want food! I just want a quick high! I sound like a heroin addict! [JASON]: If the SuperJuicers are being fed everything they need then why does Lewis feel like a heroin addict missing his fix? They’re not missing food at all. They’re having more genuine nutrition than they've had in years. They’re almost missing a drug in a way. It's like an addict coming off a drug, that's the only way I can describe it. Imagine the big food industry is like a squirrel who's selling nuts. It wants to sell more nuts because, of course, it wants to make more money. Normally in the wild animals won't eat unless they are genuinely hungry. So it can only sell nuts when its customers are hungry right? Wrong! All it needs to do is cook the nuts and add 3 highly addictive substances: fat salt and sugar! Now, something truly incredible happens! These new roasted flavored nuts have become highly addictive. They create what amounts to a false hunger. Your body is no longer satisfied when you eat them. Your natural hunger cut-off point is gone. Now, the squirrel's customers will keep buying and eating until they end up with an obese squirrel. And the big food industry is doing exactly same to us. They're manipulating our food so that we eat more and more and more. Big food is responsible for the biggest addiction facing western society today. If you into any restaurant or you're going to any mainstream supermarket we're getting poor nutrition and we're getting toxicity. It's corn, and soy, and wheat, and sugar, and salt, and chemicals. That's primarily what people are eating. Add all of the preservatives and additives used in food processing, from MSG's, to artificial sweeteners like Aspartame, for instance and also the preservatives are some of the worst that you can get in your body. So we're eating these on a daily basis. We're eating a diet that is very sparse on vegetables and replete with monoculture foods that have been spun out of factories and dumped into boxes or packages, and they do not contain life! Where is our life? You don't actually know what you're eating any more. When you eat one item, it really is composed of 25 different things. Say you're having some sort of fast-food hamburger that in the States are made-up of 50% corn and generally, it's genetically modified. Then the other 50% comes from upwards of 100 different cows. You have to ask yourself: \"What am I really eating anymore?\" The biggest thing that's wrong with the food that they were eating before is that it wasn't genuinely feeding them. Most people are overfed and undernourished. They're constantly hungry because their cells are genuinely starving! You don't often think of somebody being morbidly obese, and think that they are starving. But the irony is, that's precisely what's happening. If I carried on the way I was going, eating all the rubbish You don't realize how addictive all the white starchy refined sugar stuff is. I mean, this week I've not been hungry. I got the headaches, the withdrawal in the beginning, but I can honestly say I've not been hungry. If I go out to my favorite Chinese all-you-can-eat buffet, by the time I get home, I'd be hungry because it's not feeding my body what it actually needs. It's feeding it for a little while and then it realizes that it needs the vitamins, and the nutrients and it's hungry for them. Convenience and an instant gratification lifestyle has become become the norm. So many companies have come in to fill that instant gratification need. There's a lot of money to do research, to figure out what's going to trick your taste buds and there's a lot of money to figure out the best way to sell things. So what happens is you basically become addicted to fake foods. They're packaged up in all sorts of different forms and sold to us as being even healthy and they're anything but that! So, our tongue tastes it and says, \"Oh it must be good for you!\" Well, its just shaped like something that's good but it's not really good for you. It's actually really bad for you. And food companies, they know this. It's a billion, billion dollar industry. They know how to trick you! Anything that says \"fat-free\" is usually loaded with white refined sugar. If something says \"sugar-free\", chances are it has artificial sweeteners in. You want to know why overweight people are insatiably hungry? One of them is artificial sweeteners and artificial flavor enhancers. For example: MSG. Now MSG itself doesn't really taste good but it makes you become addicted to the food and it makes you want to eat more and more of it. So that's great for food companies. Because you're going to eat more they're going to sell more. It's perfect for them, it's just horrible for you. Sigh! Everyone wants to talk about food today. Cheeseburgers and french fries. All-you-can-eat Chinese buffet. Boiled ham. Ice cream. Pasta. Bread and butter. A big stack of ribs with barbecue sauce. I just want a ham and cheese toasty... Chips, I definitely love chips. Apple danish pastries. ..not with normal cheese, with soft cheese... Macaroni salad. Chocolate. ..the ham and the bread... Mashed potato. Steak! Ooh steak! I don't want to keep talking about this stuff. It's starting to make me get back to those thoughts. And those thoughts are actually starting to leave! If I said to somebody: \"Look a banana is going to cause obesity, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, eczema, psoriasis, high blood pressure, cholesterol\" and I say, \"Look, all you need to do is stop eating bananas.\" they would just stop eating bananas. They'd find it easy, even if they love them. But if you said: \"Stop eating white refined sugar, refined fats, or chocolate or alcohol or things like coffee\" there is an emotional attachment. Addiction to me is If the thought of never doing it again fills with you with an \"abnormal\" fear then your hooked if it doesn't then you're not. I usually have chocolate bars to cover up my problems and my insecurities and having to deal with everything face on is really, really tough. I feel like this is something I have to do to be able to move on in my life I've been eating chocolate crisps, cola, all that kind of stuff for 20 years. It's time to treat my body with the respect I should've given it years ago. The cost of our instant gratification life is that we're becoming more overweight we're becoming more unwell and we're suffering as a result of these diseases of lifestyle the diseases of nutrition, and the diseases of toxicity. We're seeing new diseases like Lou Gehrig's disease, scleroderma, lupus we are seeing an escalation of Alzheimer's disease we're seeing an increase in cancer and diabetes we're going to see continued escalation of obesity. Right now we're at a crisis point, and if something doesn't change all of these diseases are going to continue to escalate. And who would have thought fruits and veg would make you feel so good and also bad as well. It's not the fruit and veg that's making you feel bad at all. The toxins in your body that are just getting flushed out. And boy, they have been getting flushed out! I just did the cross-trainer for 10 minutes and I started having a small wheeze in my chest. It wasn't like the really painful one where I can't even breathe anymore. I took like 5 puffs of the inhaler before being on the treadmill. I jogged for a total of 5 minutes. As stupid as it may seem, that has never happened! It's crazy that today is Day 5 and that would be an effect. When I arrived, I realized that a few medications I was going to bring are missing from my bag. I did get in touch with my doctor, and she was even a little nervous, but she said since I'm coming to a place like this, that I probably don't need to worry about it too much. Maybe this happened for a reason. I have been trying to get off my meds. I think this is perfect for me. The answer to my prayers This is my CPAP machine, which is Continual Positive Air Pressure. I have to sleep with this. It's my significant other. And for the sake of her sanity, my wife sleeps elsewhere. [LOUD BUZZING] Right this is my CPAP. What it does is like I'm taking a breath. It forces the air into me, so I can't help but breathe. I'm going to hit the hay! I have only been on juice for nearly 5 days now and to be honest I've really been struggling the last few days. My ulcerative colitis has been flaring up, big time. It's been causing me a lot of stomach pains, cramping and diarrhea. I'm going to the bathroom about 10 times a day. And it's just very painful. It feels like this is getting worse, before it gets better. For me, a sign that I'm getting better would be more normal bowel movements and less pain in my stomach. I've been untreated for ulcerative colitis for over 6 years 'cause the treatments they offered started making me go blind. I don't normally just cry but this has been very emotional. I want to go home but if I was offered like: \"Do you want to go home?\" I would probably go home. First of all I thought: \"I wonder if you can get any juice from the apple?\" It's called apple juice, this is ridiculously stupid! We are so far removed from doing it ourselves. We're so used to buying everything in a carton. We're so used to the apple juice looking like you've had a pee! There are two apple juices here. I'd like to do a visual so you can see the difference. Now what's happened here, is it this is still alive, see the rich creamy head? What do I think of Andy's suitcase full of drugs? That says it all! He's got two suitcases in his room, one full of clothes. The other one full entirely of medical drugs! There we have my tablets. I'm here for four weeks and I've had to bring a suitcase because of the amount I'm taking. I'm hoping this journey is going to get rid of most of it. And I can't wait for that! I also take steroids. Now steroids come with a hunger factor. It's quite scary how fast your weight can increase when you start taking them. I've been taking them for 13 years and I would not like to see my insides because the outside is bad enough! If I can get rid of the steroids, it would be a dream, it really would. The thing that inspired me to do this big juice experiment was my own ill health It's hard to imagine now but I was covered from head to foot, in an skin condition called Psoriasis an auto-immune disease where the skin repairs itself faster than it should and produces these scales on the outside the body. I had severe Eczema. I had severe Hay fever to the point where I couldn't leave my house. It wasn't just small amounts of hay fever, itchy eyes. I mean it was like the worst flu you've ever had every single summer for long periods of time, The thing affected my life a great deal was my severe Asthma. I had really, really bad asthma. For my Asthma I was given the blue Ventolin inhaler, the brown one, which was the steroid based one at the time, I even got some steroid tablets. Not once did anybody even look at what could be causing the problem. They just wanted to treat the symptoms. With our chronic diseases, we manage them, we don't cure them, and we don't seem to want to cure them! We lower cholesterol, we try to lower blood sugar, we relieve pain in Arthritis, and we give medications for pulmonary disease, but basically there's no attention given to trying to cure these. This is the injection I take. It's an immunosuppressant, although it takes away the inflammation of my Crohn's, the side effect is that I'm open to every cold and virus and pretty much anything I come in contact with which is why I was hospitalized 3 times this year! I got a virus in my heart and my heart rate dropped quite low. The doctors didn't really know what was happening. They thought maybe I was either really fit they said Muhammad Ali has a resting heart rate of 32 beats per minute. I was like: \"I don't think that's me. I think there must be something wrong.\" This is what at the moment I'm injecting myself with every 2 weeks. I'd love to go back to only having to take them maybe once a month. And you know, ideally, nothing altogether. It would be great to be free of medication. I'd love to be up to just and delay having to take it so. Medicine, we know, doesn't fix anything. It doesn't correct anything, and a medicine is a toxin. It usually interferes with something naturally that's supposed to take place in your body. Not one single person will be cured of heart disease, pulmonary disease, stroke, arthritis, obesity, diabetes with our current medical approach. In spite of all the technology, all the medications all the research and money we throw at these problems we are not conquering chronic disease! I think the pharmaceutical industry is disempowering. They give people a very simple solution here’s a pill, that's it! You don't need to worry about anything else. Just the mere fact that they think this is protecting them stops them from looking at what is making them ill in the first place. \"If you are worried about high cholesterol or heart disease\" \"then ask your doctor about Lypintol.\" \"Lypintol is a prescription medicine\" \"that is proved to reduce the risk of heart attack and stoke.\" \"Lypintol should not be taken by people with liver problems.\" \"Your doctor can provide a simple blood test to check your liver.\" If you're in the U.S. you'll see a plethora of drug commercials on TV. These drug commercials are targeted at helping alleviate people's problems and we have a lot of problems! \"Some people can experience allergic reactions to Lypintol\" \"some of which can be life-threatening.\" \"Tell your doctor straightaway if you have an allergic reaction\" \"that causes swelling of the face, lips, tongue or throat\" \"or affects your breathing.\" \"The most common side affects include nausea, nose bleeds, headaches\" \"memory loss, insomnia, nightmares, and an increased risk of diabetes.\" You know, if you tried to sell anything under the sun that has side effects of liver damage, of kidney damage, of new diseases or even cancer and death you wouldn't be able to sell that! But they advertise these stuff all along and the public buys those things. All they are looking for is relief of their symptoms. We want a quick fix for our modern problems. And the pharmaceutical industry has promised us those quick fixes. But they're not really communicating the costs of those quick fixes. They're drugging them, and drugging them, and drugging them. And the drugs have side effects! I have to put my reading glasses on, because the writing is very small. Wow! This is incredible! Right out of the chute, endometrial cancer cardiovascular disorders, breast cancer And probable dementia. Wow! Memory loss, again, I presented with it, that causes it, this causes it! Worsening, trouble breathing, coughing and wheezing Dry mouth, nausea, stomach pain Lowered resistance to infections Confusion, shortness of breath Half of that is side effects Feeling sick, weight gain, stomach ulcers Feeling or being sick pain Chest pain, coughing up mucus and blood Feeling, seeing, or hearing things which do not exist Blindness Fever, headache Bronchitis, bruising, difficulty speaking Shock Increase pressure in the skull causing painful eyes, changes in vision Shakiness, nervousness Rashes Loss of bladder control, hair loss and unusual thoughts Symptoms of TB may happen Headaches Pneumonia Cataracts Retinal vascular thrombosis Irregular heartbeat Feeling depressed including thinking about suicide Psychosis, anorexia, osteoporosis Ringing in the ears Exacerbation of other conditions Loss of consciousness Feeling dependent or addicted to this product Death Death! If these occur, please inform your doctor. Right! So if I die, I will tell my doctor. Death is a side effect! Ha! Ha! [JASON]: I want to make it clear that I'm not saying that here isn't a place for medical intervention because clearly there is. I am not anti-medicine. For example, if you're in a car crash and your leg is broken, then clearly a few dream catchers, an aura cleanse or juice poured all over your leg are not the first things you need. What you're probably going to need is to go to hospital get some proper medical attention. And then after that you might want some juice or other therapies to support the healing process. But the point is that you need to achieve the right balance. If I have a chronic disease of lifestyle, caused by how I eat how I live, how I react to stress and the toxins in my environment I need to do something about it that's different different than going to the mainstream medical profession. I need to address those causes and the best way to address those causes is through diet and lifestyle. For the long-term management of illness you want to wean people off their medicines and start fixing the patient. [JASON]: The turning point that made me move away from the medical profession was I'd been offered treatment after treatment after treatment. Nothing was getting better at all. I think the real crunch for me came when the dermatologist said \"For your psoriasis, what I'd like to do is put some coal tar treatment on you.\" And I said: \"Coal tar, that sounds like stuff you make a road with\" He said: \"That is what it is!\" I said: \"You want to put it on my skin?\" They said: \"Yeah we'll put it on your skin put you in hospital for six weeks and cover you in bandages.\" It was at that point, I thought: \"There's got to be another way.\" Up until now I've never, ever read the sheets. They're there for communication so people can read about things but they're horror sheets! Now reading them, reading the possible side effect as in: can happen on an every day basis? That's outrageous! No, I'm seriously considering what tablets I take, now. [MUSIC] Yesterday my stomach was acting-up just a little bit, but today I feel right on form! I really do. [MUSIC] I love being out here in the lake. It's so beautiful and peaceful. Hardly anybody takes advantage of it. And when you're hurting I think it's the best thing you could possibly do for yourself. It's nice to get some alone time. Shoo-be-doo-be-doo! Cheers! I have degenerative disk, so my lower-back has always bothered me. But I just recently had a spinal-fusion in my neck. That was actually an emotional one for me! I was able to do things that I thought I'd never be able to do with the spinal surgery and the shoulder surgery. So, it was awesome! Yeah, it's good to feel, I'm clearly healing. I can't wait to do it again! I'll probably cry again, too. [MUSIC] I still am fighting a roller coaster battle. I feel like I should be further along than I am. So it's just been a really tough for me. Okay, Jon's Colitis is not clearing up as rapidly as I first anticipated so as part of the big juice experiment I'm just going to add in extra juice to see if it makes any difference. It's based on a study I've seen about cabbage juice and Ulcerative Colitis. Now, John remains very skeptical about whether this is going to work. He also doesn't want to drink it cause cabbage is not the nicest tasting juice in the world. But we are going to mix it with a little bit of apple. I am blindly optimistic and again it can't do any harm but it would be interesting to see if this works. It looks like a beer that has too much foam on the top. It's like not even going away! I guess there's nothing to do except for to try it, right? Wait, I think I might have to actually do this with a straw because there's so much foam in here. Can I take this foam out, or no? It's not as bad as I thought it was going to be it's really not as bad as I thought it was going to be. [CLAPPING] There you go. That's what I did! I like red cabbage in salads. There's nothing wrong with that at all. It's wonderful. Terrific even! Well, there's a surprise! This journey is all about surprises and another one is I never thought I'd ever drink a cabbage The mechanism behind all of our chronic diseases is inflammation. Inflammation is the response to injury. Toxins do cause injury, injury causes inflammation. If we take a look at what we've done differently, it's the things we eat. We’ve gotten away from real food. Everything is processed. I mean we don’t eat an apple any more, we eat applesauce! And it’s loaded up with sugars and preservatives and other sorts of things that are potentially toxic And in my opinion, that dietary change is the cause of most of these diseases. As we're consuming modern foods we're accumulating toxins within the body. As we accumulate toxins within the body, we're becoming prone to illness. And that illness depends on our genetic predisposition. It depends on where our genetic weaknesses is in the body. Many of diseases are just manifestations from the same thing. and the solution is about improving the nutrient quality of your food detoxifying, and addressing stress and emotional issues. It just stands to reason and common sense if the majority of those diseases are caused by diet and lifestyle then the simple answer, surely, is to change the diet and lifestyle and then they'll just get better. Since I've been out here I haven't had any symptoms which is incredible. I'm just kind of blown away by that. And I actually arrived with medication the doctor gave me just in case my symptoms flare up. I used to be on it once a month and because my dependancy has increased so much on it and the few days leading up to the injection I get quite ill. So I know that it's time to take the injection again. But since I've come out here I haven't needed the injection. Tomorrow will be a week over when I'm due it and show no symptoms. So, yeah, it’s going well. There’s only one place that we should be looking for our long term health It's the same place wild animals look for health and nutrition It’s nature! We are the only creatures in the world that cook our food. You don’t see a gorilla with a BBQ! If you were on an island you would find fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds and animal protein. Our bodies understand that. You can eat all those that you want and you will be enormously healthy. Once you start mixing other things in it causes such hormonal chemical chaos that your body just doesn't know what to do with it. If we got back to eating real foods real thing that were made or grown on the land instead of produced in a factory we would have a better chance to avoid these toxins and a better chance to avoid the consequences of inflammation. We should be juicing because so many people have impaired digestive tracts. And digestion is impaired because of the diet we've been on. Along come your beautiful juices. They go right into your intestinal tract. And those nutrients get absorbed into your system. They're going right to work within about 20 or 30 minutes. There they're feeding your body, rejuvenating, giving you energy giving your body life. This is why you should juice! Juicing is the perfect antithesis to the failures of the modern diet. I think it is the exact opposite of a Happy Meal. It is the exact opposite of some fast-food junk that we're eating. We've heard \"you are what you eat\" right? And it's so true! We eat things that are dehydrated, that are void of nutrients then we start to look and feel dehydrated, sickly, void of nutrients. We eat things like fresh green juice that are a plethora of nutrients and vitamins and hydrates the body, then you start to look younger. You start to look fresher, you start to feel more energetic and more passionate and have more purpose in life because you're actually feeling better. Juices are very alkaline, so they help you detoxify your body which is essential for weight loss to help you reduce inflammation. And it's the best way to get energy and vitality. It's going to make you feel like a new person. You're going to notice all sorts of improvements you haven't noticed for, maybe a long, long time. I was walking with one hand on my shorts. I can just slip in and out of these shorts without undoing the buttons. It's like, I should imagine, putting on a dress not that I've ever done that! Even though, I know I'm going to have to buy more clothes it's a lovely feeling. It's really brilliant! I know I'm doing well now. It's brilliant. I've got space! I got so enthusiastic about juicing, I saw everything start clearing up. My skin started to improve. My Asthma vanish within a month. I mean, that was just me personally but within one month after suffering with it for years and years and years ever since the age of eight, in fact. My Hay fever cleared up. My Eczema cleared up. My weight just went down at a rate I didn't think was humanly possible. I got really evangelical about the whole thing, as you would do. I set out on a mission to juice the world and I wrote a book on it. I was giving it to everybody I knew. I said: \"Look you've got to try juicing.\" Everybody was looking at me like I had 10 heads! Nobody had really heard about juicing at the time. I started to get letters and emails from all over the world. One person would say: \"Do you know what? I did that juicing thing that you said.\" \"I did it for 7 days you know my skin started to get better\" or \"My Fibromyalgia started to improve,\" and there appeared to be every single common ailment, condition or disease that it was improving in some way. I honestly believe that freshly extracted juice has the potential to help millions of people all around the world. It's the most important thing you'll ever have happen to your body as far as nutrients coming to your 100 trillion cells. Because juicing is an immediate absorption of food values. I know what's going to happen. It's going to happen even after this film goes out. \"Where they going to get their protein?\" \"Where they going to get their calcium?\" Let's look at this logically. You get somebody like Andy who is suffering so many different diseases. He is morbidly obese and then somebody would say \"Where are you going to get your calcium?\" as if this was an issue for him at any given time of his life! The irony is that when somebody starts doing this people panic that they're going to be nutrient deficient. If I wasn't here and I hadn't been on juice I couldn't do what I've just done! It's like I came through the doors and Andrew Morris' spirit came through and my body was left outside. If juice diet is dangerous, what I'd like for them to do is for a week, I'll take the juice diets and they can take my tablets. And then they can tell me what they think after that. That's all I've got to say on that matter! Ten, nine, eight, seven, six five, four, three, two, one. Doing juicing is brilliant. It's given me so much energy. It's made me think about what I'm going to eat when I'm finished juicing. Because you're not thinking about -- well, you are thinking about food all the time but because you've been so long without the bad food all you start craving is the good food which is really, really good. There are some people that will say: \"When they eat normally again they're going to gain all the weight back and they might get sick again.\" Well that depends on what their idea of normal is. We each remember that their normal diet made them overweight, made them incredibly sick to begin with. We've got this 28 days that, hopefully, is going to see massive improvements. And when they leave, if they go back to their old normal diet well of course, they're going to return to normal. In fact even worse because they were going in an awful direction. When we have talks about lifestyle changes and what we're going to eat we're actually talking about very healthy foods. Salads, bean, and legumes, and rice and avocados and just wonderful things. Most people would think you're here, unable to eat food you're going to be craving chocolate, and chips and all those awful things. No, I think because your body's getting the nutrients so it's craving nutritious food not junk food. You're not in that vicious cycle. We're all talking about amazing food changes and swapping recipes for really good healthy, whole foods. When they start to eat \"normally\" again what should they look for on the label? The label! If you find any food with the label on, then maybe that's the problem. whatever you're going to eat you've got to ask yourself this simple question: \"Is it low human intervention food?\" How many humans have interfered with this food before it came to me? [TOILET FLUSHING] So I've actually felt really, really good these last couple of days. Everything seems like it's finally starting to work itself out. I actually had 4 normal bowel movements in the last 3 days which for me is incredible. It just seems like everything is sorting itself out and I feel a lot better. People are even mentioning it to me like, he way that you're sitting and the way that you're acting you just look better overall. And I feel better, I feel happy and I just feel like everything is starting to work out and I think this Colitis can ultimately go into remission or I would like to say \"cure\". I'm just really happy and nothing is going to change that at this point. Three, two, one, go! – Go for it. – Go on Roger! My word, he's flying! [MUSIC] Before we climbed up the stairs I took one puff before, kind of to prevent to have to use it. That's what I do when I run now, I just have it a bit before. [MUSIC] Is it cold? - It's awesome! Yeah I bet it is pretty freezing! - Come on bro! Daaah! S##t! That's so cold! - Is that a fish? I feel weird because I'm in a lake and I've never been in a lake until today. Makes me feel brilliant! That's my English for you! It's scary though. I feel fish everywhere, and all kind of stuff! Are you going across? Huh? [SPLUTTERING] Are you going going across? If I don't killed by a speedboat in the meantime. I want to do it again. [MUSIC] I just pick an organic orange off the tree, and juiced it and this is the result from one orange, I've drunk half of it already. It's absolutely delicious. Tastes nothing like orange juice that you buy in a carton that's for sure. [MUSIC] I've had loads of highs and lows but mostly highs. And they seemed to outweigh the lows so I just feels so much better. How do I see the future? Inhaler free, maybe? And organic, definitely! Everything is going to completely change when I go home. There's no way I'm going back to the way that I was. No way! It's just not going to happen. Everyone's going to be healthy when I get home we're going to go out for walks, we're going to do things as a family rather than my partner and the kids doing something then I wait at home for them to come back. I'm actually going to go out and do it and just enjoy my life. [MUSIC] [BIRDSONG] [MUSIC] I actually feel really good. To start off, if I was really out of breath. I couldn't catch my breath and then I just carried on through I felt really good, surprisingly! Well, actually I'm kind of impressed with my progress. I walk and I do the treadmill a little bit at home but I never would have been able to do this. I'm feeling great. And despite the few upill stretches, I'm not too out of breath. We're like we're going to enjoy this walk, take it easy, she's my buddy. No pressure to walk fast or be in the front. It just kind of sunk in today that we're going home pretty soon. So you want to enjoy the moment. I couldn't walk 50 yards. I just done 10km! How weird is that? A few weeks before I came out here I was laid off from work because I couldn't walk very far. I stepped out a bit! And it really feels brilliant! I said I'd be bloody tired, didn't I? So here I am, very tired, or exhausted even! I'd love to do it again, though! You know it seems really odd that we have reached the stage in 21st century medicine and we are still at the point that we call Alternative Medicine anything other than medical drugs. Nobody even questions that. Surely, the number one doctor is to first of all do no harm. So surely, we should try plant-based medicine first and then if that doesn't work we should seek an alternative to what is obvious and the alternative should be medical drugs. It shouldn't be the other way around. I think when it comes to looking after your health you have the power to do it. You're the one that knows your body better than anybody else. I think when we are really healthy, life becomes about nourishing. Nourishing yourself on a mental level nourishing yourself on an emotional level, nourishing your body. If you nourish all your defences and you nourish all your systems and you nourish your immune system and you nourish your brain cells and the body is detoxed, how can you feel but better? When you look at the fact that the food that you eat really creates the life that you live, everything starts to change. Juice every day. This has got to be a way of life because that's when you're going to notice your life changes. This is the bottom line to health, start doing it on a daily basis. You'll never regret it. It's the ultimate way to feed your hundred trillion internal cells. The ultimate way, there is nothing else that duplicates it. You will never know how good you can feel until you give juicing a try. One of the the main reasons I did this documentary was because of my mother's situation. I'm not saying for one second that this is some kind of cure for cancer. Nor am I saying it's a cure for anything. But what I am saying is that I strongly believe that the way that we are currently treating lifestyle diseases is flawed on so many levels. In fact, it's completely wrong. I just feel, if you just do two very simple straightforward things you simply remove the toxicity coming in, the rubbish and replace the deficiencies and the body just heals itself. [MUSIC] That's right, it's Day 28 at the Juicy Oasis Camp! I'm your host, Lewis Bray. Day 28. Wow! It's Day 28! I've been only on juice for 28 days now and finally I'm there! Day 28, ridiculous! I feel on top of the world. And I feel great. I feel fantastic. I still feel fantastic. I'm able to do far more than I ever could before. I'm really pleased with myself. The results from this experiment has absolutely astounded me, and I'm going to be a juicer for life. This just four weeks out of my life has changed the rest of my life. That's all I can say. And I'm not being paid to say it. I see now things that I've always wanted to do. I actually feel that I can do them. I've missed the kids like mad but they're getting a happier, healthier mom in four weeks. That's crazy! And when I go home I really don't know what I'm going to eat! I've been only on juice 28 days. I feel great. 28 days, a month, four weeks. I've had nothing to eat. I haven't... let me get this word right \"mas\"...\"masqueraded\"...\"mastica\" Anyway, I'm not going any further on that word. I'm excited. I really am excited for the future. This month has given me a future. [MUSIC] The weight I was really, really surprised with - 17kg, 38lbs. This was my last opportunity. It was either going to be a gastric bypass or a gastric band. This is what I needed to finally go home and sort myself out for the last time. This is, been one of the best experiences of life. I didn't think I would get as much out of it as I have. It's just been amazing. I'm so, so lucky. I've got the tools and the knowledge from being here I know that I can do this at home. I've had high cholesterol for probably 15 years. It's almost half of what it was a month ago. That was one of my big concerns, and the blood sugar and that's all within normal range. The blood pressure's normal rate. And of course the weight is an awesome plus. I lost 20lbs. I came with a lower back pain, kidney pain, hip pain that I've for a very long time. Shoulder pain, neck pain. Most of pain had been for well over a decade. A lot of went away the first week and the rest, it's all gone. I'm looking forward to getting home and having everybody see. Even if I don't say anything, they're going to see the difference in me. It would be impossible hide it. I have dropped 33lbs which is really, really good. My overall health and how I feel has just become much better. I don't crave foods to make me feel better. I don't crave chocolate. So excited to hopefully inspire someone who's sat on the couch eating a packet of crisp and wishing they weren't. And I hope they feel: \"Well if he can do it, I can do it!\" My conditions have changed dramatically. My Ulcerative Colitis, I would like to say I'm going to cure myself of it but it was a really long journey there. It took it took me like 20 days to actually even start feeling better. But now I actually see the light. I truly believe that, for me, specifically the cabbage juice it really has made a world of difference. You know, I guess the message is if you really want to be better take control of your health, do whatever it takes And even if you want to give, don't give up. Drink your juice and you know you'll be fine. And I think, if you do that then you'll be able to take your health back and take your life back. Over the 28 days I lost almost 8kg. My cholesterol went down from 6.7 to 5.9, that's good. My allergies have improved. For the Asthma part when I started I was running 4 minutes, painfully and now I run about 30 minutes and I've increased my speed quite a bit. And I walked 20km. So the results are great. I'm just more energized and motivated. My cramps and the inflammation stomach has gone down so I haven't needed the injection at all since I've been here. I've gone from being on all this medication for the doctors being backed up against the wall to not being on any medication at all. So, I'm not as dependent on medication as I originally thought or even the doctors thought. I definitely feel better for this experience. This has just been life-changing, 100%. I've been able to come off all of my medication. Because of some of the meds I was hypoglycemic. I have no hypoglycemia at all now. I have no shakes, no fainting fits, nothing! And it's life-changing for me. It's wonderful. You can only do yourself a favour if you try this. It's the best food you can put into yourself and the fastest way you can get healthy, without question. I'm taking away fantastic experience and a great deal of knowledge and what I believe is the ability to maintain my long-term health. And while I may still be 67, I certainly don't feel it. My results, I was well happy! First of all this morning, I jumped on the weighing scale and I found that I lost 38lbs, which I'm really chuffed about! I arrived as a Diabetic, I'm leaving with no sign of diabetes. The CPAP machine for Sleep Apnea is now a door weight because it's no good to me at all. If I didn't change then I really wouldn't of lasted much longer. I would have probably added another year, two years in it. But that would be it. I would have been dead and it would be too late to juice. This four weeks has really saved my life. That's a juice! That really is a juice! The results have been phenomenal. Yes, the end of the 28-day experiment for sure but I really hope this isn't the end for them. I hope this is the beginning of a life-long change. I hope they picked up the tools they learned while they've been here and they really take charge of their own health and understand that their health, from this point on really is in their own hands. To notice the big improvement in such a small amount of time I just want to get home and carry on, I feel amazing. 200% better, I feel great, I feel energized! Now I feel like I'm on a course to get progressively better and all these amazing results really give me the momentum to do that. I truly feel like I'm 100% right now which I have not felt 100% in probably 25 years. That's pretty incredible. I'm looking forward to trying to maintain a healthy lifestyle when I get back and just keep healthy basically. I feel like my attitude towards medication has changed. I know that I can go a month without my medication and it's kind of the start of something beautiful, I think. So, I'm kinda delighted. My overall health has just improved beyond all recognition. Health and happiness those are the 2 main symptoms that I'm suffering from and that's terrific for me! And now my journey has really saved my life. There's no \"if\"s, \"and\"s, or \"but\"s. It's fact! It really has and a lot changed my life. This is absolutely fantastic! I'm on the start line of the biggest half-marathon in the world. In June, I couldn't walk 300 yards, and I'm now about to do 13 miles. The library of information that I have been reading for 10 years trying to get better. Every book that I bought and every little thing that I went for I thought, \"OK, this is going to be it.\" And this actually is it! The doctor was concerned that I wasn't on medication and he said that I will never be able to cure my Crohn's disease with food. He said that point blank. And then he followed up by saying: \"By the way, your results are there's no evidence of Crohn's disease in your gut.\" I'm not having any of the pain or problems. The cabbage juice has really been a miracle for me. Well, now there's a funny old story! Once we had the interviews at the end of the 4 weeks Jason said, \"What was I going to do?\" And I couldn't think of anything else but staying, really. Now we've started, I'd really like to see it through. Well, as you know, I had 2 suitcases coming out. One was for the tablets, the other one was my clothes. Now, as I said previously I was taking 40 tablets a day. But when I actually counted them up it was actually 52 tablets a day. Now Jason did want me to go home with just one suitcase and that was my clothes, obviously. But unfortunately, still I do have to take two suitcases. One is my clothes. And a second one, well, the second one, I actually have here and that's my tablets, so, yeah, I got two tablets a day now I'm on. So I've lost 50 tablets somewhere and I'm feeling absolutely fantastic. So, yeah! Here we go!",
